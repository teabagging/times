Perhaps he imitated his mentor too much, right down to the debonair baritone. Now, in San Francisco, as the mastermind of a festival called Soundscape USA, he is creating something entirely in his image.  Nothing quite like it has ever been seen in a concert hall: a raucous survey of the experimental tradition in American music, a sellout audience swamped by fans of the Grateful Dead.         Finishing his first year as music director, Mr. Tilson Thomas has put a bold  imprint on the San Francisco Symphony. Already excellent under Herbert Blomstedt, the orchestra has added tonal heft and stylistic versatility. The conductor also has interesting taste. American music, for him, means neither formulaic nostalgia nor pre-approved modernism. He leans toward the unsystematic avant-garde, what he calls the \\"maverick tradition.\\" His flaw is a tendency toward meandering, uneven programs.

Even the initial exploit of the Warner Brothers, \\"Tenderloin,\\" was, if anything, less ludicrous than this current specimen of talking picture.Aside from the remarks of the characters and their adventures, which stirred up chuckles and giggles, the producers of this sad specimen of film work have seen fit to have the Lord's Prayer recited by a Father Colomb, whose accent is not particularly reminiscent of anything French.The tale is really too absurd to think about. Sometimes it looks as though it had been inspired by a passage from \\"Les Miserables,\\" but it decides to stay within its rediculous realms.Dolores Costello, a Parisian dancer, who by nature is a cross between a rose and a thorn, is bitter because Dr. Deboise failed to save the life of her little brother, who is known here as \\"Petité,\\" evidently intended for Petit. Like so many of the quasi heroines of melodramatic pictorial effusions, Joan Villaire (Miss Costello) appears to be torn between love and revenge.There is a gloating specimen named Jetteur Lupine, who specializes in knifing and drowning. Dr. Deboise is doomed to be stabbed and permitted to float down the swift running stream of a Hollywood conception of a Paris sewer.It chances that some legitimate denizens of the sewers lift up a manhole and they casually observe that a man is passing. It is the unconscious form of Dr. Deboise, who, from the way in which this is filmed, appears to be roving in a perfectly natural manner. From then on one does not have to worry about Dr. Deboise, for it is fairly certain that he is going to stagger along to the fair Joan at the psychological moment. There is also a more or less foggy notion that Jetteur is not going to have as happy an existence as he had mapped out for himself.To hear Miss Costello demanding \\"the jewels\\" causes one to wonder how such an incident could have been permitted to remain in this production. It naturally evoked laughter last night, and that despite the evident good-nature of the spectators.When, in an early episode, Petit is taken to the doctor, there is hysteria and discussion, and finally Joan goes over to the unconscious boy and shakes him, which impresses one as not being exactly the thing to do to a dying youngster. That, however, is one of the minor stupidities of this chronicle.Miss Costello and Mr. Nagel, under the dircection of Howard Brotherton, are not permitted to do much more than take their places and register given emotions. It is hardly what one could call acting. Mr. Richmond's impersonation of Jetteur is done by merely a series of sneers, frowns and smiles. Lionel Belmore is earnest enough as the priest, but he is miscast.

Since the French are basically most comfortable at embracing countries they think they have discovered, or where they suppose they are greatly admired, another approach is required.   What the French (about 1.6 million of them last year) do about visiting England is to protect themselves. Mostly, they overbid: the shabby becomes the sublime. Feeling insecure, the French on their own in London don't mock, but swoon. A hotel carpet worn woofless is a marvel; a pair of heather green knee-socks becomes an article of transcendent chic.

It is also more ambitious, and potentially more fun.As E. M. Forster put it while placing his works beside Beethoven's Ninth Symphony and Blake's \\"Song of Innocence,\\" to commemorate his own centenary in a 21st-century editorial for The Times of London: \\"Like Beethoven, like Blake, Forster was essentially English, and in commemorating him we can yet again celebrate what is best and most permanent in ourselves.\\"And now, after Forster, after Beethoven, after Blake, comes Alf Garnett—as essentially English as any of them, and very permanent. Alf is the hero of \\"Alf 'n' Family,\\" a movie by Norman Cohen and Johnny Speight, which opened yesterday at the Juliet I. Neither an artist, nor even-quite a thinker, Alf is a man whose opinions are his truest memorial. Of these he has a plentiful supply.The film picks Alf up in 1939 and drops him in the 1970's, during which time the world changes—though he doesn't. A working-class Tory","excerpt":"a patriot; a coward; scorning Hitler, the Pope, \\"Lili Marlene\\"; he begins as a loud-mouth fool and, by simply staying himself, ends as something of a loud-mouth hero.Along the way he begets a daughter, gains a son-in-law, loses a house, hangs onto his prejudices and (the film is cagy about this) keeps his principles intact. There are problems inherent in presenting a lovable, laughable old chauvinistic racial bigot; and \\"Alf 'n' Family\\" mainly solves them by looking the other way.Thus Alf says he hates \\"coons\\" but actually embraces blacks, despises socialism but likes his daughter's Socialist husband, still worships Churchill but—well, whom is there left to worship? By growing firmly out of date, Alf moves into sentimental history. The times have assured that there is all the difference in the world between the braggart idiot on the home front laughing off Dunkirk, and the little fellow more than 20 years later stubbornly holding onto his house despite the urban demolition plans of the Greater London Council.Though it covers a lot of time, \\"Alf 'n' Family\\" is really a strung-together succession of short, comic situations. (The same characters appear in a British TV series which was the model for the American \\"All in the Family.\\") It follows that some of the skits are good, some not so good, some—too many—ending in a kind of laughter-begging personal embarrassment as Alf discovers that he has jumped to attention without any clothes on, or stuck his foot in hot water or cracked his skull on a window frame.But there are also moments of heart-warming pleasure, such as when—during war rationing—Alf steals milk for his tea from his own baby's bottle. Or, when Alf's wife announces she is pregnant, and the two of them sit in mute astonishment, wondering when the child could have been conceived.Dandy Nichols plays Alf's wife, and Una Stubbs plays his daughter, and they both furnish good conventional British comedy caricatures.As Alf, Warren Mitchell seems to improve as he ages and as he has more detail to put into his role. He is better with such detail than he is with comic invention. But he manages to project beneath his conservatism an undercurrent of sly anarchy; and it is this that allows him in drunken good humor to reduce his daughter's wedding to chaos, or, while praying in church for divine assistance, to cheat God out of a few shillings at the collection box.

Just 14 months after strong-arming the North American Free Trade Agreement through Congress, President Clinton was forced to scrounge $52 billion to save Mexico from a financial crisis -- a rescue widely viewed as a bailout for Wall Street and a symbol of the Administration's inept foreign policy.         But economists are inclined to interpret these events far more kindly. By most criteria Mr. Clinton's decision to act as lender of last resort has apparently paid off. While Mexico's recession has been deeper than expected and  unemployment remains punishingly high, exports have surged. And in spite of pessimistic predictions from critics of the bailout, Mexico has managed to refinance the short-term debts that led it to the brink of default without exhausting its line of credit with the United States Treasury. The Union Bank of Switzerland, among others, is predicting a return to modest economic growth next year financed in part with imported capital that had fled Mexico only months ago.

Señnor Bunuel has indulged in a dream sequence (probably to keep his franchise with the experimenters) and he has visual comments to make on such serious matters as sudden life and death. Basically, however, his unihibiited cast has little trouble in projecting the fine time they seem to be having on this eventful trip. The original title of the film was \\"Subido al Cielo.\\"The central plot, dealing with the efforts of a young, newly-wed's desperate journey to get a will drawn for his dying mother, which will thwart his covetous brothers, merely seems to be a rudimentary device to introduce not only a varied covey of Mexican rustics and their habits, but also the tropical and spectacular mountainous countryside.The types with whom we meet on this hectic passage include a torrid and nobly endowed wench who is not coy about her feelings for our harassed hero. The bus driver, a happy, carefree soul, has nothing but compassion for the young man's desire for speed but he is not averse to going to sleep when the mood overtakes him or, for example, stopping en route for a full-blown fiesta to celebrate his mother's birthday.There also is a local, loquacious politico given to grandiose speech-making","excerpt":"a peasant woman whose haste to see the doctor comes to naught when she has her baby on the bus, and, as poetic counterpoint, the farmer's young daughter, who was gaily alive when first seen and is a corpse when the returning bus passes her home again.Señnor Bunuel's roving camera has captured comic and satirical nuances in the attempts of the passengers to tow the bus from a shallow river, where it has stalled, first by a team of oxen and then by a tractor—the cattle do the trick for both the bus and the tractor, which has become stuck, too.Señnor Bunuel's slightly vague preoccupation with symbolism aside, he has managed to corral an interesting passenger list. Esteban Marquez, does a sensitive stint as the hero who wrestles with the temptations of the curvaceous and sultry Lilia Prado—a lady who smugly states, \\"I got what I wanted\\" —while his heart belongs to his pretty, peasant bride, played with ardor by Carmen Gonzalez.Credit Luis Aceves Constaneda with a fine, comic job as the happy but lackadaisical driver, and Manuel Donde, as the guntoting, braggart of a politician. Competent but brief portrayals are contributed by Leonor Gomez, as the morbund mother and Roberto Cobo and Roberto Meyer, as her conniving sons, as well as some of the many unlisted natives on this junket.

Ratings and running times are in parentheses. An index of reviews of films opening today appears on page 10.    Now Playing    * ''AS GOOD AS IT GETS,'' starring Jack Nicholson, Helen Hunt and Greg Kinnear. Directed by James L. Brooks (PG-13, 133 minutes). Nobody does a better job of backing characters into happiness than Mr. Brooks, especially when those characters are so high-strung that happiness is almost out of the question. Echoing the quirky appeal of his ''Broadcast News'' in a more conventional sitcom atmosphere, this zinger-filled comedy a trois features high spirits, strong acting and tart writing. Mr. Nicholson, whose other recent performances have been virtually phoned in, is back in fine form playing an obsessive-compulsive misanthrope. His appalling, awfully funny wisecracks account for much of the film's spiky humor, especially after he winds up with the companions he deserves: a gentle gay painter (Mr. Kinnear) and a lovely, long-suffering waitress (Ms. Hunt), who is his own personal Alice Kramden. Complications ensue (Janet Maslin).  * ''THE BIG ONE,'' starring and directed by Michael Moore (PG-13, 89 minutes). Mr. Moore's ''Roger and Me'' agenda of ambushing captains of industry has lost some of its novelty, but he still fares well in taking his act on the road. While documenting his adventures on a cross-country promotional tour for his book ''Downsize This!'' (which means the danger of demagogy is never entirely at bay), he puts together a lively amalgam of crusading, informing and just plain kidding around.  Behind the pranks that bring some levity to a film about corporate downsizing and its consequences, Mr. Moore communicates real concern for the issues he takes on. His casual, loose-jointed film nicely balances serious advocacy with playful stunts (Maslin).  * ''THE BUTCHER BOY,'' starring Eamonn Owens and Stephen Rea. Directed by Neil Jordan (R, 110 minutes). This story of a freckle-faced Irish schoolboy may look familiar at first, but the true nature of Mr. Jordan's brilliant, harrowing film takes it way beyond the ordinary. Skillfully adapted from a novel by Patrick McCabe, it enters the increasingly dangerous mind of Francie Brady, the film's young protagonist, as he descends into madness and fury and watches his family (with Mr. Rea as his sodden father) fall apart. Most jarringly, the story sustains his whimsical adolescent viewpoint","excerpt":"a pet goldfish can touch off a wild rage in Francie, played with extraordinary spontaneity by the film's young star, Mr. Owens. As in all this filmmaker's very best work, the hidden extremes of human nature take his storytelling into perverse, fascinating terrain (Maslin).  ''CITY OF ANGELS,'' starring Nicolas Cage and Meg Ryan. Directed by Brad Silberling (PG-13, 112 minutes). An empty Hollywood re-make of ''Wings of Desire,'' Wim Wenders's poetic 1987 cult favorite, ''City of Angels'' wants to be a blockbuster sobfest in the supernatural romantic tradition of ''Heaven Can Wait,'' ''Ghost'' and ''Titanic.'' But the ingredients don't gel. Mr. Cage is the droopy sad-sack angel who falls in love with Ms. Ryan's perky, bike-riding Los Angeles cardiologist and tumbles out of heaven just to be with her. Unfortunately, Mr. Cage looks more like a serial killer (or a sinister cult leader) than an angel, and he and Ms. Ryan lack romantic  chemistry. The screenplay's watered-down New Age cliches are illustrated by cinematography that lends the California settings the shallow gloss of a shampoo commercial (Stephen Holden).  ''LOST IN SPACE,'' starring William Hurt, Mimi Rogers, Heather Graham, Matt LeBlanc, Gary Oldman, Lacey Chabert and Jack Johnson. Directed by Stephen Hopkins (PG-13, 90 minutes). Reruns, anyone? The B-movieish television series of the mid-1960's spawns an overblown screen version with 750 special effects, which sometimes seem to be going on all at once. While Mr. Hopkins's direction is gung-ho, the film has energy even when it doesn't have much sense. It borrows from ''Star Trek,'' ''Alien'' and even ''It's a Wonderful Life,'' but manages to remain fairly grown-up-proof just the same. At least the stars, notably Mr. Oldman in Shakespearean sci-fi mode, can look forward to seeing themselves as plastic action figures from this toy-crazy extravaganza. Kids, take note: the young hero gets to play a fancy virtual-reality game while defending his family (Maslin).  ''NEIL SIMON'S 'THE ODD COUPLE II,' '' starring Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau. Directed by Howard Deutch (PG-13, 90 minutes). Three decades after they teamed up for the movie version of Neil Simon's hit play ''The Odd Couple,'' Mr. Lemmon and Mr. Matthau are back as the cranky, jousting bachelors and ex-roommates Felix and Oscar, and they are much the worse for wear. On their way to the West Coast wedding of Oscar's son and Felix's daughter, the pair get lost in the desert, lose their rented car and are  arrested on suspicion of transporting illegal aliens. Don't ask why. This strident laugh-free comedy doesn't have one good joke (Holden).  ''THE OBJECT OF MY AFFECTION,'' directed by Nicholas Hytner. Starring Jennifer Aniston and Paul Rudd (R, 111 minutes). The latest Hollywood comedy to play house while playing with gender roles is easier to watch than believe. Ms. Aniston is energetic and adorable, too much so for a woman who knows exactly one heterosexual man (a comically unappetizing one) and falls in love with her gay roommate. Pregnant, she asks her charmingly reticent friend (Mr. Rudd) to help her raise the baby, and toothless complications ensue. Whatever the real-life issues raised by such a menage, this stylish but thin comedy isn't up to handling them. Adapted by Wendy Wasserstein from Stephen McCauley's breezy novel of star-crossed relationships, it features welcome worldliness from Nigel Hawthorne as the one wise, rueful figure in the story (Maslin).  ''PRIMARY COLORS,'' starring John Travolta, Emma Thompson, Kathy Bates, Adrian Lester and Billy Bob Thornton. Directed by Mike Nichols and written by Elaine May (R, 140 minutes). This polished Hollywood diorama freezes and contemplates recent history, with the lightly fictionalized account of a Southern Governor and his shrewd, ethically challenged Presidential campaign. But while the stars deliver fine caricatures (and sometimes, especially in Ms. Bates's case, steal the show on their own steam), the film as a whole is slow-moving and uncertain. Fitfully funny at first, then gradually more thoughtful until it takes a turn for melodrama in its final stages, ''Primary Colors'' faces two challenges: a passive central character (Mr. Lester) who is mostly a blank, and a real world that's stealing its thunder. Unlike the more nimble and cynical ''Wag the Dog,'' this one isn't ahead of the news (Maslin).  ''SOUR GRAPES,'' starring Steven Weber and Craig Bierko. Directed by Larry David (R, 97 minutes). The co-creator and longtime writer of ''Seinfeld'' makes his leap to the big screen without leaving the slightest doubt where he came from. While ''Seinfeld'' counts down to its finale, the essence of the show is alive, well and funny -- if also threadbare -- here. Working without the pizazz of his television cast and with stiff, bland compositions that would look drab on the small screen, Mr. David still invokes the same spite, pettiness and scheming at the heart of America's favorite weekly comedy. In this story of two cousins turned enemies by a winning bet in Atlantic City, expect coffee-shop conversations, escalating wild twists of fate and a strong sense of deja vu (Maslin).  * ''THE SPANISH PRISONER,'' starring Campbell Scott, Rebecca Pidgeon, Ben Gazzara and Steve Martin. Directed by David Mamet (PG, 112 minutes). The most engaging of Mr. Mamet's cinematic puzzles begins with an X-ray at an airport security check. And the audience will wish it had a similar device for reading the characters' sneaky minds. No such luck: the mystery here, in a handsome and Hitchcockian film named for an elaborate con game, stays tricky to the very end. Mr. Scott plays the inventor of a lucrative, stealable scientific process, with Mr. Gazzara as the boss who's in no hurry to compensate him for it. In an ensemble cast working entirely on the calculating Mamet wavelength, Mr. Martin plays a rich, debonair mystery man who tells the inventor all about his pretty young sister.  In her performance as a pert, unaccountably off-kilter secretary, Ms. Pidgeon perfectly embodies the film's sleight of hand (Maslin).  * ''TITANIC,'' starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet and Gloria Stuart. Directed by James Cameron (PG-13, 197 minutes). For once, a much-touted event movie is exactly that: a glorious throwback to the days when epic storytelling really filled the screen. Despite the astonishing technological advances behind Mr. Cameron's great visual spectacle, gimmicks are never allowed to intrude on the film's central illusion: that the audience is drawn back into the Gilded Age and intimately involved in the fateful voyage. For all its painstaking historical detail, this ''Titanic'' proves anything but quaint, thanks to the phenomenal immediacy of its sights and the pure Hollywood hokum of its story. As two young lovers whose romance is skillfully interwoven with real historical detail, Ms. Winslet and Mr. DiCaprio are a duo with serious chemistry. With his ''Gone With the Wind''-caliber ambitions, Mr. Cameron dared to dream of the impossible and came up with the movie of the year (Maslin).  * ''VIRGINIA WOOLF'S 'MRS. DALLOWAY,' '' starring Vanessa Redgrave, Natascha McElhone and Michael Kitchen. Directed by Marleen Gorris (PG-13, 97 minutes). Even for moviegoers who see adapting the classics in terms of formal gardens, vanilla outfits and grand parties, Virginia Woolf's majestic novel amounts to a substantial challenge. It has been met as well as possible by this faithful film version, featuring a luminous performance by Ms. Redgrave in half of the title role. With each major character played by both a young actor and an aging one, and with the many details and detours the story finds in a single 1923 day in London, this film is not fully appreciated without a trip to the library. But it is haunting, faithful and reflective, a surprising success in fathoming the last woman in 20th-century literature whom we might expect to find on screen (Maslin).  * ''WILD MAN BLUES,'' directed by Barbara Kopple. Featuring Woody Allen (PG, 104 minutes). In her unexpectedly delightful documentary about Woody Allen as jazz musician, this esteemed documentary filmmaker demonstrates cinema verite at its most seductive.  In classic fly-on-the-wall fashion, the camera watches Mr. Allen, his band, his sister and his future wife, Soon-Yi Previn, take a grand tour of Europe during which Mr. Allen is rarely without a line worthy of his own comedies.  When the jubilant New Orleans jazz starts, he comes alive through this music, but the film also records hotel room vignettes that reveal him in a surprising new light. The final scene, a hair-raising encounter with Mr. Allen's parents, would make a nice visual aid at any psychotherapist's office (Maslin).    Film Series    ''DAWN: EARLY CHINESE CINEMA.'' In conjunction with its landmark exhibition, ''China: 5,000 Years,'' the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum is presenting a three-week festival of rarely seen masterworks of Chinese cinema. This inaugural series in the museum's new Film and Video Exhibition Program comprises 16 films offering insight into modern life in China, particularly in Shanghai, and a demonstration of the experiments of early Chinese filmmakers. Most of these films have never been seen in North America; most are silent films that will be shown to the accompaniment of live piano scores composed and played by Donald Sosin. This weekend's attractions include ''The Peach Girl'' (1931), a classic melodrama, to be shown at 2:30 P.M. tomorrow; the earliest film in the series, ''A String of Pearls'' (1926), an adaptation of de Maupassant's ''Necklace,'' at 7 P.M. tomorrow, and ''Tale of the Western Chamber,'' a story of ephemeral romance, at 6 P.M. on Sunday. The series continues through May 16 in the Peter B. Lewis Theater in the museum, at Fifth Avenue at 89th Street. Tickets are free with museum admission on the day of the screening. Information: (212) 423-3587 (Lawrence Van Gelder).  NEW YORK WOMEN'S FILM FESTIVAL.

Twenty years ago, Kun Woo Paik was poised for a big concert career: he had studied with Wilhelm Kempff and Rosina Lhevinne, won the Naumberg and Busoni piano competitions, given a series of acclaimed recitals. Then, rather suddenly, he moved to Paris and went into semi-retirement. On his own terms, he has found an unexpected middle ground between late-20th-century clarity and high-Romantic bravura. He can draw enough thunder to raise the phantoms of legends, but behind the wash of tone there is an almost unsettling stillness and poise.   Unheralded and poorly attended, Mr. Paik's recital on Sunday night at Alice Tully Hall explored some arcane and monumental regions of the repertory: Shostakovich's Prelude and Fugue No. 24, two of Busoni's Elegies and his Toccata, Rachmaninoff's bizarre First Sonata. Mr. Paik molded the Shostakovich into a single arch of ever-heightening tension, drawing a coldly passionate tone. The distant tragic scenery of this music made for an unconventional curtain raiser, and the audience was perceptibly stunned.

Mr. Perez, a young pianist, had paired himself with the young tenor saxophonist, David Sanchez, and together they managed to articulate about every note they played. Mr. Perez played be-bop lines double-handed, as if to put them in quotes, then abruptly shifted to wispy single-note right-hand ideas, changing the density of his sound. He threw in double-handed flurries, then used silence. And his rhythmic sensibility -- funny and always surprising -- kept his improvisations moving with the suspense of a good narrative.

And his rhythmic sense, percussive and ponderous in the wrong hands, is a staple of improvisers 30 years later.         Because of his general influence, the proliferation of his recordings and his regular appearances in the jazz trenches, Mr. Tyner has been easy to take for granted. But his tunes for Tuesday's first set were carefully constructed, with  the saxophone speaking a melody, giving way to a short burst of improvisation by Mr. Tyner, then returning to the saxophone for more of the melody.

Alla Nazimova appears as a French dancer adventuring in British East India. Could those who delight in the exotic actress because of her exoticism wish for anything more? Some who have seen how genuinely human she can be, as in all but the ending of \\"Eye for Eye,\\" may inquire whether she lives in \\"Stronger Than Death\\" or only acts, and perhaps they will be disappointed to learn that she only acts—though she does act as few screen players can.The photoplay is a grandoperatic tragedy with a novel ending, a popular novel ending of the most approved type. It is love, of course, that is stronger than death. It cures the dancer's weak heart and strengthens her to live happily ever after, when, according to the medical diagnosis and dramatic emphasis of the story, she should have died magnificently, dancing for the man she loved.The plot of the piece is built around a brutal Colonel in command of a British garrison in India, his heroic son, a villainous half-breed and the French dancer, with mutinies and executions thrown in to keep things going. The dancer has been advised by her physician that if she dances again she will die, but, when only her art can express her love for the Colonel's son, and help him suppress a native uprising, she dances—in a Brahma temple in the moonlight. And then she doesn't die.As may be imagined, there are many striking pictures in \\"Stronger Than Death,\\" and the scenes seem to represent the Indian locale accurately. The acting on the whole is above the average, and those able to lose themselves in an essentially unreal story will probably follow the course of events with quickening interest. A number of the incidents are well pictured and the characters, all automatic, are distinctly drawn.Charles W. French, as the Colonel, gives one of the best performances of them all, and Charles Bryant, as his son, is invariably good and sometimes, when an occasional scene gets away from the story, impressive. Herbert Prior is all that could be desired as the half-breed, and Henry Harmon, as an old native priest, has dignity and, when fitting, intensity.Herbert Blaché and Mr. Bryant directed the production.Also at the Capitol is an interesting Prizma picture, showing views of a Japanese fishing village","excerpt":"a pictorial account of the capture of a tiger with a rope in the hands of Major Jack Allen, and \\"The Garage,\\" with Roscoe Arbuckle.Whatever ???else \\"The Woman in the Suitcase\\" is, it serves to demonstrate the ability and charm of Enid Bennett, for though the story is one of the most frankly artificial and impossible presented for a long time, Miss Bennett, in her own part, succeeds in being almost real. The photoplay is not, as its name might suggest, a mystery story. There is never any mystery to it. The woman is really not in the suitcase at all; only her picture is.Mary Moreland (Miss Bennett) finds it in her father's bag and then sets out to learn why father has transferred his affections from mother, and how he may be recovered for the family circle. She follows a course that could never be successful, but so omnipotent and benignant are the powers that propel movie plots, that she goes straight ahead in her purpose, succeeding at every turn and ultimately bringing father home to mother in safety. Incidentally she brings some, too, a young man destined to take her out of the recently mended circle.Those in the cast are William Conklin as the father, Claire Me???well as the mother, Dorcas Matthews as the woman photographically in the suitcase. Roland Lee as the young man, and Donald McDonald as the easily eliminated villain. All of them do what is required by the story, and some of them contribute a little more. The production was directed by Fred Niblo.Apparently Miss Bennett, after her enduring success in \\"Stepping Out,\\" is sentenced indeterminately to a series of pictures of similar intent, but unfortunately lacking in vitality, and it can only be hoped that she will soon serve her term and be freed for another triumph.The Arbuckle comedy, \\"The Garage,\\" is also at the Rivoli.A screen translation of Zane Grey's \\"Desert Gold,\\" with E.

The story is based on Ottilie A. Liljencrantz's novel \\"The Trail of Lief the Lucky,\\" which concerns the hardy Norsemen who are supposed to have crossed the Atlantic one thousand-odd years ago and landed on this country's soil.The prismatic effects in this production may not always be the desired quality, especially when it concerns fire and water, but they are none the less agreeable. There is the glint of metal and the flashing of semi-precious stones on the wristbands of the horned or wing helmeted, flaxen-haired warriors of bygone ages. Occasionally there are scenes that are like beautiful paintings, but here and there the colors, while they do not fringe or mix, are not quite true.The make-up of the players is often more than a trifle overdone, especially when the villain reveals on close inspection his mouse-colored eyelids. Most of the men appear to have had excellent razors and to have been most punctilious even on this auspicious voyage in indulging their fancy for a morning shave.It will also be remarked by most people who witness this production that for a girl of the North in the year 926 Helga has been most careful regarding her wardrobe. Pauline Starke, who with a long, fair wig impersonates Helga, sees to it that the maid had quite a few changes aboard Lief's little craft. She is perceived in various colors, which come out extremely well, but sometimes her costumes are just a wee bit too reminiscent of the far-famed bathing beauty of 1928. Latterly she appears in a snow-white plain wedding gown, which comes as quite a surprise, for one never for a moment imagines that she is thus prepared for the wedding ceremony, especially considering she is virtually a stowaway aboard the vessel after it slips away from the murderous Eric's stronghold in Greenland. Miss Starke, however, succeeds in looking very attractive and in doing a great deal to call attention to her figure.Donald Crisp, who played the pugilist in D. W. Griffith's \\"Broken Blossoms\\" and who directed Douglas Fairbanks's picture, \\"Don Q,\\" here figures as the hardy Lief. He does very well with the rôle, especially during some of the sequences aboard his boat. He has a blonde mustache that is carefully curled and which never seems to have a hair out of place. Quite often you expect Mr. Crisp, and also some of the other players, to burst forth into song as they stand face to face in anger or love.Lief appears to have been somewhat dull-witted for it seems strange that he should have countenanced the presence of Egil, a dark-haired villain, aboard his boat after it turned its nose westward from Greenland. It is this Egil who is always popping up and causing trouble. He fills the slaves and others aboard the vessel with the notion that sooner or later the boat is going to drop over the edge of the world and that they all are going to be devoured by monster dragons.There is a none too convincing scene of England's cliffs, but who knows but that they were not so white in those days? Greenland's icy mountains have not been omitted, but they look far from real, despite the natural color. This is, however, a picture where lips are red and when the hardy Vikings shed a little blood they let the red gore be seen on their blades.Anders Randolph, who portrays the axe-throwing Eric the Red, gives a sterling account of himself. His pallid countenance bespeaks the anger that stirs him. Le Roy Mason fills the part of the English nobleman who is captured in his own castle and taken as a slave by the dreaded Vikings.Three Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Movietone productions were exhibited before the feature was screened. A playlet called \\"Phipps,\\" with Cyril Chadwick, Lowell Sherman and Betty Francisco, was amusing in its lines, but the technical end of the production is very poor.

In fact the players are—with the possible exception of Alice Terry—just as one imagined they would be after reading John Russell's story, which was called \\"The Passion Vine.\\" Miss Terry, although quite appealing as Miss Matilda, the missionary's daughter, is a bit too much of the motion-picture actress.Ingram gives as faithful an idea of the loneliness of Miss Matilda on the South Sea Island, as John Russell does in his story. As the young Pagan chieftain, Motauri, who falls in love with Miss Matilda, Ramon Navarre takes advantage of every opportunity.You are exasperated with Pastor Spener (Edward Connelly) for his inattention to his daughter and his self-sufficiency, also because of his greed for money and his blindness to the foulness of Captain Hull Gregson, the brutal, scheming and often drunken trader, to whom the missionary is willing to sacrifice his daughter. Harry T. Morey is capital in this hate-inspiring part.Miss Matilda's hunger for love causes her to notice the handsome Motauri; she meets him near the passion vine, not far from her father's house, and is discovered by Gregson, who spies with a telescope.In order to get into the good graces of Pastor Spener, Gregson decides to stop selling intoxicants to the natives, and the missionary is so gratified that he consents to Gregson marrying his daughter.The idea of marriage to the trader is l???evolting to Miss Matilda; she suddenly ???onsents to elope with Motauri, and, so as not to pass through the tiny village, he carries her down a miniature Niagara, helped by the clinging passion vine, hoping to find a boat at the bottom of the ravine. There is none; Gregson having suspected something, had ordered all boats off the beach. So to get to his own island he is forced to return alone for a boat, and is caught by Gregson. Miss Matilda is left below alone, and it occu???rs to her that her husband is, if not so dark himself, the head of a tribe of blacks. She regrets her decision to elope, and eventually crawls back in a terrific hurricane, falling at the door of Gregson's shack. Gregson and Motauri have a terrific fight in which finally Gregson is killed. Miss Matilda tells Motauri that she cannot marry him, and the young Pagan carries her back to her father's porch, where she faints.After be has left his wealth, a small bag of pearls, in the hand of the white girl. Motauri, true to tribal traditions, springs to death in the depths of the ???avi???e.

He calls it a thought—photographing a thought—and in the introductory chapters aboard a dredge he succeeds cleverly in creating an interest which is mildly mindful of Eugene O'Neill's \\"Anna Christie.\\" But this current effort possesses little action and the chief characters are an intensely lethargic lot. The producer has a weakness for posing his players and overemphasizing certain rather amateurish points.There was infinitely more romance concerned with the making of this picture than in the final result. It is said to have cost an absurdly small sum. The picture was eventually shown to Charles Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford, who were so agitated with enthusiasm that they bought an interest in the film for much more than the whole effort had cost. Possibly the simplicity of this production is what stirred them—mud and inertia carrying an appeal much stronger than jewels and jazz vivacity.However, despite the fact that Mr. von Sternberg wanted to stretch his thought to six reels, he would have strengthened his production materially by picturing natural movements with his characters and eliminating some of the symbolic touches.George K. Arthur impersonates the Boy, a sluggish dreamer with pure thoughts. Mr. Arthur's performance in some of the sequences is quite interesting, but he does look rather well nourished to be suffering from the pangs of hunger. His sloth is abominably exasperating, as one would expect any youth with health and strength to do more than he does to find work. In one scene he comes to the comfortless room with a stick of chewing gum, which he shares with the Girl and the Child. He wanders around with his hands dug deep into his trousers pockets, searching for work, often signs confronting him that no help is wanted. After a spiritless attempt to obtain employment he returns to the room in the horrible house, and lolis on a plush sofa, with the Girl and the Child beside him. They think and moan.At the outset Mr. von Sternberg pictures a cat eating refuse, seagulls as scavengers, and a bit of beach strewn with wreckage. Then there are the excellent scenes aboard the dredge with the great iron shovel going about its work of gnawing up the mud, which the producer points out fills in as quickly as it is dug out. The Boy wanders on to the dredge to see the Girl, who is smoking a cigarette the Brute gave to her. With the even swing of a pendulum the great shovel is seen pulling forth muck and water and with a sort of yawn letting it out into the dredge. The Child's parents have been victims of this great iron implement, and he lives aboard the dredge. The Brute comes across the Child, who is disobedient. We have seen a good many brutes, but have yet to see one who wanted to hold a child about six up to the side of a barge and start to strike him with a gnarled fist.When the Boy perceives the Brute's action he stands aghast. We are told the Boy is a coward. He starts and stops, and finally goes to the rescue of the boy, who one thinks is about half killed by the time the rescuer reaches that end of the craft.The shovel spills its slime and muck over the Brute, and the Boy and the Child make their escape, the Girl accompanying them. They encounter a lascivious beast, known as the Man, who smiles in oily and calculating fashion upon the Girl. He thinks her more attractive than the Woman, and invites the trio to take shelter in one of his rooms. There ensues a number of situations that are wearying. The players move their heads very slowly when talking to one another, and the Man usually takes up a pose under a pair of horns, giving him a diabolical aspect.It is the thrashing of the Man by the Boy that eventually changes the Boy, and also the Girl. She gains confidence in him and he feels himself no longer a coward or a drone. The fight between the two men is well done until the last round, when, after the Boy is shown to be exhausted and dizzy, he picks up the Man and pitches him over the embankment into the automobile. Quite an effort!Mr. von Sternberg has pictured the Boy's day dream in an interesting and exotic fashion.

But George Balanchine's excerpted version of the classic (the second act) is very little like what Nureyev danced, although it pays homage to Lev Ivanov, the 19th-century choreographer who created that act. The greater point made by the program, which the company's director, Peter Martins, dedicated to Nureyev's memory in an affectionate speech, was how much ballet has changed since Nureyev defected from the Soviet Union in 1961.   Balanchine's \\"Swan Lake,\\" once cramped but oddly lovable, now takes place in a vast ice palace designed by Alain Vaes at the choreographer's behest. It is populated by peculiarly costumed hunters and swans dressed, with the exception of Odette, in black. And although Darci Kistler and Ben Huys made a handsomely matched, radiant Odette and Prince Siegfried, their impeccably danced performance was permeated with a now rather empty-feeling chill, unknown to the classic, that once communicated Balanchine's vision of purity.

But this time, instead of leaving behind hundreds of thousands of South Vietnamese, the Americans who put up more than $3 million for this ill-conceived lawsuit left on the courthouse steps the wreckage of a senior American general's reputation.

But the premature closing should not detract from the process that brought the play to this highly creative point.    With a quick response to a volatile political situation, Miss Churchill used her playwright's art to clarify the chaos of the Romanian uprising. Several months after the dictator Nicolae Ceausescu was executed for crimes against the state, Miss Churchill, the director Mark Wing-Davey and a group of students from the Central School of Speech and Drama in London went on a fact-finding mission to Romania. On location, they explored the roots and the effects of the revolution that toppled the Ceausescu Government from power.

And besides, his 25-year-old shoes didn't come from Brooks Brothers or some preppy spawn thereof, but were a result of the 52-year-old Mr. Gurney's decidedly plebeian labors in a shoe factory in the summer of 1958.

Not only is it of historical interest, but it also has a theatrical viability of its own as an acerbic commentary on the wages of blind philanthropy. As such, the play spoofs the sentimental comedies of Goldsmith's day, the late 18th century, and also, by extension, mocks pretensions of later times. In a sense, it presages the culture of radical chic.   The current production, directed by Anthony Cornish, is modest and respectable and is a useful introduction to a comedy that is seldom performed.

They are merely pictorial clichés to accompany the editorial that is voiced.Thus, when Mr. Reynolds opens up with a sketchy review of the history of the last thirty-five years, the pictorial clichés unreel—World War I battle scenes, President Wilson in Paris, Mussolini in Rome, Haile Selassie addressing the League in Geneva, Hitler's legions, the Japs in Manchuria, the Panay. And likewise when Mr. Reynolds goes on to estimate the events of the last five years in Asia, the news shots are equally routine. More significantly, they are assembled with no sense of accumulated image or design.The sole content and impact of the picture are in what Mr. Reynolds has to say, and this is obviously opinion of a debatable sort. With several repeated adjurations to the audience to \\"face the facts,\\" he makes such observations as \\"Communist Quislings, in a masquerade of deceit, are grabbing China\\" or \\"the Communists' military victory in China does not mean they have won over the Chinese people\\" or \\"Britain hopes, by recognizing Red China, to buy peace\\" or \\"we still have a powerful economic weapon—embargo.\\"In short, the thesis of Mr. Reynolds—and of \\"Death of a Dream\\"—is that Communism must be defeated in China to prevent another aggression of the Hitlerian sort.It is apparent, despite the publicizing of this film as \\"the prelude to Korea,\\" that it was assembled and the narration completed some time before the current conflict began.

The tribal life in this grass-hut community of subsistence farmers is orderly and ritualized. But it is also a place of glaring sexual inequities. The women work side by side in the fields with their husbands but share few of the men's rights and privileges. When a young woman marries, she becomes a piece of property who can be \\"inherited\\" by a male relative when her husband dies.    As remote as it is, the village is not entirely untouched by modern urban life. Enough information leaks in from the outside world to sow the seeds of a feminist rebellion. \\"Finzan\\" tells the stories of two women who go up against the prevailing customs. When Nanyuma (Diarrah Sanogo) a sturdy, stubborn field worker, is widowed, her brother-in-law Bala (Oumar Namory Keita), who is the village idiot, petitions the local chieftain for her hand. Over Nanyuma's furious objections, his request is granted, and she is forced to marry him. When she refuses to sleep with him, he attempts to rape her, and she runs away. Eventually she musters enough support from the other women to make involuntary marriage an issue that begins to divide the community.

She opened a week of solo concerts on Tuesday night with a program that included her amazing treatment of Stravinsky's \\"Rite of Spring,\\" which roused the audience into a frenzy of enthusiasm.   In the two other pieces, at the Joyce Theater (175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street), the evolution within her own repertory was striking.   \\"Bardo,\\" the premiere and one reportedly inspired by a concept in Tibetan philosophy, focuses on the intensely centered stillness already evident in the 1989 solo that opened the program: \\"The Floor Dances (Requiem for the Living).\\"   \\"State of Darkness,\\" the Stravinsky solo created in 1988, peaks with the full-blown whiplash power that brought Miss Fenley to special notice in the late 1970's. But it, too, has crucial moments of deeply channeled concentration, so much so that when the dancer explodes into a physical release, this energy carries the audience along emotionally. Several viewers could be seen sitting on the edge of their seats at this point.   Miss Fenley's uncompromising rigor is not necessarily everyone's idea of entertainment. But the sheer stamina involved in this tour de force of a 40-minute solo could be recognized by everyone. Emotion through energy, no matter how modulated, is her form of communication.   Miss Fenley, dancing bare breasted and in black tights, birdlike whether quivering in minute muscular nuances or leaping exultantly with arms flung out, terminated this huge physical effort by standing and then suddenly stepping forward. Like a partisan accepting execution, she embodied in this acceptance the sacrificial victim offered to the gods in Stravinsky's \\"Rite of Spring.\\".   Miss Fenley's imagery has an expressionistic streak rendered in purely abstract terms. It is never grounded in literal description but neither is her work only formal, concerned with movement for its own sake or with structures alone. Obviously, it was a mistake to see Miss Fenley in the same category as other choreographers, who also use a reductive vocabulary and repetition. She uses these devices differently, less mathematically or less mystically. True, she is often concerned with rituals but the gods to whom they are addressed take the form of self.   \\"Bardo\\" for example, is obviously concerned with some sort of spiritual journey. The title of the premiere is a Tibetan word, meaning a dreamlike suspension between two worlds. That state is life, between birth and death.   The entire dance, except for one move to the rear, consists of Miss Fenley's trajectory in a diagonal across the stage against a backdrop that thanks to David Moodey's superb lighting, takes on the pale blue-green hue of Celanese pottery.   It is a solo of great purity, but also one that is difficult to watch in that its minute modifications are difficult to see. On the surface, it looks like a series of poses, usually with in some sort of plie or knee bend. Yet Miss Fenley's weight is often shifted unexpectedly in these still moments. A twisted torso or a knee bent to the side creates a sculptural shape","excerpt":"a plie drops into a deeper one. The illusion is that the solo is performed in slow motion, when it is actually being defined with clarity.   \\"Bardo,\\" dedicated to the memory of Keith Haring, uses a score by Somei Satoh, \\"Mantra.\\" The chanting, Buddhist fashion, grows in intensity and volume, its texture contrasting with the porcelain refinement of the dance.   \\"The Floor Dances (Requiem for the Living)\\" is more accessible although never illustrative. Part druid, part animal creature with fluttering hands, Miss Fenley remains seated or kneeling in the floor here. She is ringed in by a circle of jagged stones, Richard Long's sculptural installation called \\"Dancing Stone Circle.\\"   Inspired by the \\"memory of the wildlife devastation of the Alaskan oil spill,\\" the solo is completely original, using a cresecendo of movement attached to the floor (Miss Fenley never stands up) with invention and feeling. The wounded bird here is also the shaman who can enter the world of the animal spirits, and the sound of hope is always there in the magnificently chosen music: the first song from \\"Symphony of Sorrowful Songs\\" by a Polish composer, Henryk M.

The landscape proved highly inspirational to Wordsworth, who took most of his poetic cues from nature. Living with his sister, and surrounded by a circle of poets and writers that included Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Charles Lamb, Robert Southey and, later, Thomas De Quincey, Wordsworth enjoyed his most creative years. HOME AT GRASMERE: The Wordsworths and the Lakes (Collins & Brown/Trafalgar Square, $29.95) chronicles this period. Penelope Hughes-Hallett, the author of \\"Jane Austen: 'My Dear Cassandra,' \\" winds the story around excerpts from William Wordsworth's poems, as well as passages from Dorothy Wordsworth's journals and other letters and writings. She demonstrates that Wordsworth frequently borrowed from his sister's lyrical observations of nature and of the rustic characters who roamed the countryside. William, however, consistently underplayed Dorothy's contribution to his work. Ms. Hughes-Hallett's story, lavishly illustrated in watercolors that capture the extraordinary beauty of the Lake District, offers a glimpse into Dorothy's fanatic devotion to her brother, including her heartache over his marriage. The book is most enticing in its presentation of personal turmoil and tragedy: Coleridge's long addiction to alcohol and drugs, the misunderstandings that wrecked the close relationship between Wordsworth and Coleridge, the deaths in 1812 of two of Wordsworth's children, and, finally, Dorothy's madness. \\nCLAUDIA RICCI IN SHORT: NONFICTION","excerpt":"A Poet and His Sister"},{"year":"1985","title":"Josephine Miles, a poet and member of the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters, died Sunday at her home in Berkeley, Calif.

Translated and Edited by Rosemary Lloyd. 268 pages. The University of Chicago Press. $24.95. The life of Charles Baudelaire quite blatantly contradicts Chesterton's famous observation that the artistic temperament is a disease afflicting amateurs. While his meticulously crafted work was strict, indeed almost classical in form, Baudelaire himself led a manic, disordered existence that sounds awfully like a grade-B movie parody of 19th-century bohemian life. Besides overindulgence in alcohol, opium and hashish, there were pernicious debts, syphilis -which resulted in assorted nervous disorders, dizzy spells and death at the age of 46 - noisy, fragmented relationships with women and incessant attacks of what the poet would call spleen. In fact, Baudelaire was almost always in a bad mood - either enraged by the horrors and indignities of the world around him, tormented by the loneliness of his self-inflicted solitude, or simply bored with himself and everyone around him.   ''What I do know,'' he wrote in 1863, ''is that I feel utterly disgusted with everything and particularly with all kinds of pleasure (that's no bad thing) and that the only feeling that convinces me I'm still alive is a vague desire for celebrity, vengeance, and fortune.''

With the permission of Sexton's older daughter and literary executor, Linda Gray Sexton, Dr. Orne turned over more than 300 tapes (as well as some unpublished poems) to Ms. Middlebrook for use in this biography.

A10    Afghan Mission Tests NATO  NATO is bigger than ever, and is reaching further than ever before, by taking the lead in the war in Afghanistan. But the Afghan mission threatens a rift within the Atlantic alliance between those nations able and willing to participate fully in combat operations in Afghanistan -- and those nations that are not. A11    A suicide bomber walked into a packed restaurant in southeastern Afghanistan and set off his explosives, killing 15 other people and wounding 25, Afghan officials said. The attack came after weeks of relative quiet and raised fears that insurgents were resuming their campaign of suicide bombings.

The latter is on the program with the 8 P.M. showing of the film in Philharmonic Hall. There is also a 6 P.M. showing. The festival is sponsored by the American Society for Eastern Arts in cooperation with the India Council of the Asia Society.Lest one be misled by the title of Mr. Ray's unfamiliar film into thinking it may have something to do with mountain climbing on the world's third highest peak, be assured that there is nothing as dramatic or strenuous as mountain climbing in it. Indeed, the great mass of Kanchenjungha is revealed only at the end, when the mists roll away and we are shown it as an evident symbol of the emergence of Indian society—or social snobbery—out of the mists of the past.For this is another contemplation by the philosophical and poetic Mr. Ray of the slow and painful adjustments of the Indian middle class to conditions brought on by changes in the economy and government. Now he has moved on three or four decades beyond the period of his Apu trilogy and beyond the stage of decadence of his fading land-owner in \\"The Music Room,\\" to a gentle consideration of the anxieties of people today, confronted with national independence and the growing disregard for lines of caste.His people here are members of a well-to-do family enjoying a brief vacation in Darjeeling, a famous resort in the Himalayas, where they are hopeful that their college-educated daughter will hook an eligible bachelor.Papa is a tyrant, a sturdy symbol of the mercantile class, who achieved success and honors under the British and feels India is the worse without them. He is anxious to have his daughter become engaged to a pompous young man who has a promising career before him, and feels, very much as Papa does. But Daughter becomes attracted to a poor young scholar who reads Rabindranath Tagore and is not interested in a job in business. Now, what is Daughter to do?As benign as this slight situation is Mr. Ray's approach to it. He seems as soft and relaxed in his filmmaking as his characters are in the mountain air. In long stretches of conversation while they patiently walk the paths of the beautiful and restful hill station, he has them gracefully and tactfully discuss the perplexities of political science, social customs, education and love. In the end—as the mountain emerges — it seems agreed that one should many for love.In his customary way, however, Mr. Ray does not commit himself wholeheartedly. He dwells upon the mists of Darjeeling with a quiet suggestion of affection for the past. His representation of the father, played authoritatively by Chhabi Biswas, respectfully places and considers his conservative point of view. The daughter, acted serenely by Nilima Roy Chowdhury, is a blend, in her gentleness and piety, of the old and new.Other members of the family—an older sister and her restless husband, who are estranged","excerpt":"a poky uncle who is a bird-watcher; a wistful mother and brother who is a clown—are sluggish and sentimental in their encounters with what are actually clichés.Mr. Ray, in this instance, has not bitten off as much as he could chew.

The chairman of the Federal Reserve Board then was William McChesney Martin, and President Kennedy used to say, ''M stands for Martin and Monetary Policy.'' But now the chairman of the Fed is Paul A. Volcker. You could say V stands for Velocity and Volcker, but that is obviously harder. You have to remember that M (Money) times V (Velocity) equals P (Prices) times T (Transactions). That equation tells you what Monetary Policy is about: to control M (assuming V behaves itself) so that P (Prices) are flat or do not rise more than a little while T (Transactions or real economic activity) expand.

Brodniewicz) is well photographed and clearly recorded, and M. Waszynski, the director, never allows the action to drag. The acting of the principals and their supporters is first rate, especially in the case of Miss Smosarska and Pan Brodniewicz, the former showing much improvement over her work in earlier Polish pictures. Some scenes of the country-side and of historic buildings are very interesting.The story concerns the rise in the legal profession of a girl, betrayed when hardly more than a child by a handsome and thoughtless youth, their encounter fifteen years later when he returns from the United States and opens an elegant cabaret with money advanced by a medical professor (Pan Samborski), her falling in love with him all over again and her final assignment to try him.

In 1984, Sibylle Schonemann and her husband, both film makers frustrated by restrictions on their work, asked the East German Government for exit visas. The next thing they knew, they had been arrested on charges that were never made clear to them. Ms. Schonemann spent a year as a political prisoner, then was put directly on a bus for the West. Her husband, who received a slightly longer sentence, and their two children were sent after her, with only a few suitcases of belongings.

For the producers of the new British melodrama, which opened Saturday at the Trans-Lux Sixtieth Street Theatre, have provided sufficient incident of a violent and humorous turn to keep the mind alert for most of the picture's ninety-five minutes running time.The scenarist doesn't waste any words, and the director quickly establishes the proper atmosphere of suspense in the opening reel. A figure in dress clothes deftly fingers an embassy safe in Paris, takes out a book, tosses it to a man in the garden below and coldly shoots a servant who happens to intrude as he closes the safe. The deed done, the figure lights a cigarette and casually rejoins his attractive accomplice in the ball-room.In a matter of minutes night turns into day and we are aboard the Orient Express as the pair seeks to catch up with the third party, who has double-crossed them by running off with the diary containing explosive political secrets. It is a long train and it takes time to track down someone when his compartment is not known and inquiry has to be made judiciously so as not to arouse too much curiosity among the crew. The director, John Paddy Carstairs, shrewdly maneuvers the pursuers and the hunted about the train in a natural and credible manner so that the possibility of an imminent meeting creates a good deal of tension.As the camera roams through the speeding train several interesting characters turn up, and, by deft juggling of circumstance on the part of the author, all of them become logically involved in the final recovery of the diary.Among the diverting sideshows is the embarrassment of a noted lawyer taking a clandestine holiday with a girl friend when he is spotted by a client","excerpt":"a pompous lecturer and his bullied secretary-man servant; an American soldier with an eye on a couple of French cuties, who gets stuck in a compartment with a bird fancier; and one of those \\"dash it all, old chap\\" British types who latches onto the train's harried, temperamental chef.None of the principals is too familiar to audiences here, and at times dialogue is lost in some of the players' throats, but the performances are generally satisfying. The principal roles are played by Albert Lieven and Jean Kent as the seekers of the diary; Alan Wheatley as the absconder; Derrick de Marney and Rona Anderson as the couple trying to enjoy an illicit romance, and Paul Dupuis as a French police inspector who is conveniently aboard to take charge when murder and other violence come as an exciting climax to the pursuit of the diary.

Last year in the Book Review, Craig Seligman praised ''the maturity and the austerity and the exceptional tact of the writing,'' and said the book ''gives every indication'' of being ''the herald of a phenomenal career.''    THE TROUSER PEOPLE: A Story of Burma -- In the Shadow of Empire, by Andrew Marshall. (Counterpoint, $16.) The author journeyed to modern-day Myanmar to retrace the footsteps of Sir George Scott, one of Burma's first colonial rulers and a quintessential Victorian who meticulously recorded the habits and habitats of the Burmese hill tribes. Last year in these pages, Elizabeth Becker called this an ''evocative travel book'' that examines the sad fate of those tribes under the current military dictatorship.    THE BRIDEGROOM WAS A DOG, by Yoko Tawada. Translated by Margaret Mitsutani. (Kodansha, $12.95.) In these three stories, a schoolteacher's retelling of a randy fairy tale has bizarre consequences in her personal life","excerpt":"a poor mail-order bride tries to uncover the identity of her eerily absent husband; and a woman takes a surreal train ride through a Swiss mountain tunnel. ''Each one sustains a masterly balance between the tenuous but meaningful connections of dreams and the direct, earthy storytelling of folk tales,'' Michael Porter said here in 1999.    RACISM: A Short History, by George M. Fredrickson. (Princeton University, $14.95.) A historian argues that while racism has been practiced everywhere throughout history, the Enlightenment notions of human equality led to the development of a distinctive Western ideology to justify the mistreatment of others. The author's ''characteristically crisp, clear'' account ''draws both on a wide range of recent work by others and on nearly half a century of his own writings . . . to provide us with a masterly -- though not uncontroversial -- synthesis,'' Kwame Anthony Appiah wrote in these pages in 2002.    LONGITUDES AND ATTITUDES: The World in the Age of Terrorism, by Thomas L. Friedman. (Anchor, $14.95.) The Times's foreign affairs columnist, in an updated collection of essays supplemented by material from his diaries and other notes, examines, among other things, the tentacles of American power, the Middle East conflict and the transforming experience of the Sept. 11 attacks. Last year our reviewer, Geoffrey Wheatcroft, found the book a mixed bag but said ''few writers express better the sheer perplexity of America today.''    THE DEAD CIRCUS, by John Kaye. (Grove, $14.) Set in the Hollywood of 1969 and 1986, this novel revolves around a private investigator whose efforts to solve the mystery of a rockabilly star's unexplained death cause him to disturb a nest of unsavory secrets, including his own connection with Charlie Manson and his ''family.'' '' 'The Dead Circus' is a looming thundercloud of a book: it begins in a Southern California that seems permanently infused with sunshine and ends in one that has been forever submerged beneath the dark surf of a noirish nightmare,'' Stephanie Zacharek wrote in these pages in 2002.    FOURTEEN: Growing Up Alone in a Crowd, by Stephen Zanichkowsky. (Basic Books, $15.95.) The author, the 8th of 14 children in a Roman Catholic Lithuanian-American family, tells of being raised in fear in the 1950's and 60's in a household ruled by parental anger, physical punishment and gratuitous cruelty. ''In the struggle to understand, Stephen Zanichkowsky has brought poetry to a disturbing tale of what it is like to grow up without joy,'' Sarah Payne Stuart said here last year.    CHRONICLE OF THE SEVEN SORROWS, by Patrick Chamoiseau. Translated by Linda Coverdale. (University of Nebraska, $15.) Originally published in France in 1986, this challenging Caribbean novel, the author's first, recounts the rise and fall of Pipi Soleil, a humble ''djobber'' who toils in the market stalls of Fort-de-France, Martinique. The result is ''a yarn spoken out loud'' that ''conjures up the stories of the Caribbean without falling into folkloric condescension,'' Alberto Manguel wrote here in 2000.

But judging from the thick catalogue that accompanies the impressive if not totally satisfying overview of his career at the Guggenheim Museum, Mr. Oldenburg's polymorphous talent took up a breathtaking amount of space.         The catalogue illustrates the famous object-filled environments, like \\"The Street\\" and \\"The Store,\\" that Mr. Oldenburg erected in such downtown storefront  galleries and performance spaces as the Reuben Gallery and the Judson Church on  Washington Square. It quotes at length from the diaries and notebooks in which,  writing in an often brilliant free-flowing vernacular, he enumerated his fascination with an art that rose directly from the sweaty, sensuous energy of the city's streets, an art at once popular, populist and widely accessible. \\"I am for an artist who vanishes, turning up in a white cap painting signs or hallways,\\" Mr. Oldenburg once wrote. \\"I am for an art that grows up not knowing  it is art at all . . . that you can pick your nose with or stub your toes on.\\"    ART REVIEW","excerpt":"A Pop Absurdist Who's a Happening All by Himself"},{"year":"1971","title":"ELEY England, Aug. 28 (AP) &#8212","excerpt":"A pop festival near here ?? into running fights be tween the police and young people today, leaving dozens injured, two with suspected skull fractures.

A performer who was dismissed as a relic by the generation that had turned its back on pre-rock pop music, he has seen his reputation soar over the last decade, as that generation has discovered the riches of the past. Among those still living who are considered custodians of the pre-rock canon, Mr. Bennett now ranks just under Frank Sinatra and Ella Fitzgerald in reputation. And in his show, \\"Steppin' Out on Broadway,\\" which plays through Saturday at the Longacre (220 West 48th Street, Manhattan), he shows how richly he deserves that status.

Fathers seemed to smoke heavily, ''makings'' from Bull Durham, while they talked endlessly of unions, politics, baseball, the Depression. And my dear, deceased father was no exception to my thesis.

Coolidge has been something of an inspiration to Ronald Reagan. The enormous Coolidge tax cuts were cited by Mr. Reagan as an early instance of supply-side economics. A paragon of Yankee frugality, Coolidge was the last President to reduce the national debt, and he presided over a period of prosperity. His most famous utterance was, ''The business of America is business,'' and Ronald Reagan has spent much of his life promoting that idea - as a spokesman for the virtues of free enterprise, courtesy of General Electric, and as a politician.   As President, Mr. Reagan has maintained his friendliness toward business in a variety of ways. He labored hard, for example, to win Congressional passage of accelerated depreciation and of cuts in capital-gains, estate and gift taxes. He set the machinery in motion to ease Federal regulations that business finds onerous. According to the President's economic calculations, such moves would create a new confidence in the future among the leaders of the business community, those who make or influence the billion-dollar investments in productive capacity that could fuel a boom reminiscent of the Coolidge era.

It was a minimal, brutally electronic disco track produced by Bobby (O) Orlando, a New York disco deejay.\\"    The 36-year-old singer and lyricist who formed the Pet Shop Boys nine years ago with the keyboardist Chris Lowe, who is now 31, was reflecting on the disparity between the duo's hard-edged electronic style and the sophistication of songs whose angular melodies and thoughtful lyrics transcend ordinary dance pop.    On the duo's new album, \\"Behavior\\" (EMI), one song, \\"My October Symphony,\\" blends an acoustic string quartet into the electronics. Its lyric portrays a contemporary Soviet composer meditating on the disintegration of Communism in his country and wondering what to revise or rewrite in a work that was written to celebrate the Russian revolution.    The song was inspired by Dmitri Shostakovich's memoir, \\"Testimony,\\" Mr. Tennant said.    \\"Until I read it, I hadn't realized the extent of fear among Soviet artists,\\" he said. \\"Many of them used to go to bed at night with a suitcase packed just in case there was a knock on the door. I think that in Eastern Europe now there are ambivalent feelings about all the changes. They're incredibly happy that they've got freedom, but they're worried that something valuable has been thrown out.\\"    In another song, \\"Being Boring,\\" Mr. Tennant nostalgically recalls his bohemian college days in the early 1970's. The title, he said, was inspired by a Zelda Fitzgerald quote about life in the jazz age: \\"We were never bored because we were never boring.\\"    \\"When I was in Newcastle in the early 70's,\\" Mr. Tennant said, \\"I belonged to a group that hated progressive rock, hated the schools we went to, and loved David Bowie and going to the theater. The one thing we didn't want to be was boring. I remember I used to go around telling everyone I was going to be a pop star. Last year, one of my closest friends from that group died of AIDS. The song is meant as an elegy.\\"    A video for \\"Being Boring\\" was recently shot by the photographer and film maker Bruce Weber, who is making his video debut.    Perhaps the most pointed song on the album, \\"How Can You Expect to Be Taken Seriously?,\\" attacks pop stars who cynically attach their names to humanitarian causes to enhance their public images. \\"You're another major artist on a higher plane,\\" goes the sneering lyric. \\"Do you think they'll put you in the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame?\\"   \\"To me the content of the best pop music has always seemed to come out of some statement against things,\\" Mr. Tennant said. \\"The more pop music is all about being positive and for things, the more banal it seems. Pop is fashion. Right now we're being bombarded in the media by stars going on and on about ecology. But pretty soon a pop star will come along who says he doesn't care about ecology, and then you'll get a generation of teen-agers who will be bored hearing about it on MTV. Humanitarian issues are important -- too important to be dealt with by pop stars.\\"  Films on Musicians    Seven of the most interesting recent independent films by and about musicians and music are being shown in a series at Anthology Film Archive, tomorrow through Dec. 12.    Opening the series is the New York premiere of \\"Man No Run,\\" Claire Denis's documentary account of the West African group Tete Brulee's first French tour.

Slim Figures     If the fall has seen phenomenal pop successes in the debut albums of Vanilla Ice and Mariah Carey, each of which has sold around three million copies, the season has also seen a number of recordings selling well below expectations.    This week, George Michael's \\"Listen Without Prejudice, Vol. 1\\" (Columbia) dips to No. 8 in its seventh week on Billboard's pop album chart after peaking at No. 2. It now seems likely that eventual sales in America will be only a fraction of the seven million racked up by Mr. Michael's previous album, \\"Faith.\\"    Prince, after being given a temporary career surge by the movie \\"Batman,\\" has slipped back into his commercial decline of the last five years.  Sales of \\"Graffiti Bridge\\" ( Paisley Park ), the sequel to the eight-million selling \\"Purple Rain\\" soundtrack, are hovering at around one million. After peaking at No. 6, the record has dipped to No. 52 in its 10th week.    Bob Dylan's star-studded \\"Under the Red Sky\\" (Columbia) has also plummeted, to No. 100 in its 10th week after peaking at No. 38. And Daryl Hall and John Oates's \\"Change of Season\\" (Arista), has gotten off to a very slow start. After only three weeks on the chart, it has stalled at No. 70.

Mr. Schickel keeps detecting parallels between Stanwyck's off-screen life and the roles she chose to play.

By 1933, with the support of the Soviet military, he was working on rockets of a sort that the Germans were busying themselves with, too.

Polished, elegant and full of assured humanity, the piece has become a signature work for Mr. Gordon. And so his revival this year of \\"Framework\\" and \\"TV Reel,\\" another classic from the early 1980's, was welcome news.    Seen on Saturday night at the Colden Center of Queens College, \\"Framework\\" sleekly integrates passages of pure dance, a litany of spoken phrases and the manipulation of scene-suggesting frames and painted flats. The dance also offers an amusing but hideous look at a man battling with constant intrusions by the outside world, in all its hectic, pointless clamor. It could be a portrait of the artist or of Everyman, or just a probing yet playful media mix. On all three levels it works, and the dance received an electric performance from Dean Moss as the moody, rueful anti-hero, in a fine cast that also included Karen Graham, Pamela Geber, Tim Hadel, the wonderfully tough-talking Gayle Tufts, Jeremy Weichsel and Scott Cunningham, a delightful sleepy crosspatch here.

This weekend the Feld will dance one of two new works that will have official premieres during the company's regular season at the Joyce Theater in March and April. \\"Frets and Women,\\" commissioned in part by Tag-Heuer, the Swiss manufacturer of sports watches, will be performed tonight and tomorrow afternoon and evening. The official description of the ballet -- as a series of ensemble and solo dances that differ in shape and rhythm but are unified by their emotional shadings -- could be used as well for anything from \\"Giselle\\" to the latest eruption from south of 14th Street. The dance is set, however, to music by Lou Harrison, whose new popularity among choreographers these days is much deserved.

It is so seemingly casual and impromptu, so evidently uncontrived, both in story development and in the manner in which the shots are made and arranged, that it might be seriously labeled the \\"method\\" way of making a film.This accounts for some suddenly exquisite and isolatedly eloquent little bits in Mr. Engel's picture, for which we understand he conceived the story and served as producer, director and camera man.There is the moment, for instance, when the lovers, he a photographer of \\"Weddings and babies\\" on the Lower East Side and she an occasional model (apparently, most of the time, for him), have just taken his old Italian mother to a home for the aged and left her there. The experience has been emotionally upsetting and both young people are obviously on edge. As they come out of the building and pass beneath a large tree, they suddenly throw their arms around each other and clasp in a desperate, silent embrace.There is also a beautiful moment in one of the several quarrel scenes, when the two, alone together in the fellow's modest studio, reach another dead end in their endless bickering about getting married and having a home.\\"Aw, cut it out!\\" the fellow, petulantly played by John Myhers, barks at the girl, as he impatiently and confusedly turns away.She looks at him and an expression of tragic inquiry comes into her eyes. \\"What am I supposed to cut out?\\" she asks him simply. \\"My love? My heart?\\"The girl is played by Viveca Lindfors, and everything she does—every movement, every gesture, every reaction, every lift and fall of her voice—is so absolutely right and convincing that the style drapes most fitly around her. She IS a young woman on the Lower East Side trying to coax or shame her lover into marrying her, always doing it with feeling for his weakness. She is the solid core of this film.But, unfortunately, the spontaneous \\"method\\" — the do-it-as-you-feel-it approach, accounts for more looseness and banality than beauty and eloquence. The story — or call it merely conflict—rambles disjointedly through a couple of vexing incidents with the old mother and a couple with a jealousy-agitating friend. While it offers more character exposure than has been evident in Mr. Engel's previous films, it fails to develop cohesion and leaves many questions—indeed, the conflict—unclarified.Also, Mr. Engel's peculiarly \\"natural\\" photographic style provokes more irritation and bewilderment than surprise. People are casually suspended half in, half out of a frame","excerpt":"a principal character's head is cut off through part of a critical scene. Sometimes the \\"live sound\\" recording is so cluttered with off-screen sounds, including the whirr of the camera, that you can't understand the dialogue. And Mr. Engel has a bad way of stretching some atmospheric but non-essential scenes.His faults are a shame, for his ideas and his technique are fundamentally good, creative and progressive. His actors are true and credible. And he has Eddy Manson to provide him with another pulsing, plaintive musical score. Perhaps when he gets somebody with real professional skill to write him a script and he learns to hold his camera more firmly, he will give us the great American urban film.

And two years later Showtime again breathed life into ''The Paper Chase'' by commissioning new hour-long episodes from 20th Century-Fox, making the series the first work of its kind to cross from broadcast television to cable.

It is a shrewdly directed subject with many impressive Technicolor scenes. Moreover, although it possesses the usual extravagances to be found in this type of story, it is endowed with admirable characterizations by Jean Hersholt, Eleanor Boardman and Ralph Forbes.\\"Mamba,\\" it is set forth on the program, is the name given to a South African snake. The reptile of this adventure is Auguste Bolte, a slovenly, hoggish plutocrat, who is constantly reminding those with whom he has a chance to converse that he can buy anything. This rôle is played by Mr. Hersholt, who, with his hair oiled down and combed party over his forehead, recalls his appearance in the film, \\"Greed.\\" But there are times when this repulsive Bolte neglects to shave or brush his hair. He is no favorite in Neu Posen, East Africa. The German officers hold themselves aloof from him and the only individual he has an opportunity to talk to at length is his valet-secretary, a cockney, who feeds his master with flattery.One afternoon Bolte recalls that he has received a letter asking for $100,000 from Count von Linden. The Count is in Germany and in a footnote it is written that Bolte might marry von Linden's daughter. Helen. The white people of the post have as little to do with Bolte as possible and the British officers across the frontier also spurn him. It occurs to Bolte that a beautiful wife would perhaps help to make life more agreeable for him. He thinks also that the officers would then overlook some of his failings and be quite impressed. He therefore hies himself to Germany.Helen, like most daughters who marry wealthy villains in melodramas, does so to save her father from ruin. There is a flash of the wedding and soon Helen (Miss Boardman) and her ignoble husband are seen aboard the steamship bound for East Africa. On the same vessel is Karl von Reiden, the officer who is to take charge of the Neu Posen post. He is not averse to a little flirtation with a beautiful woman and therefore when Helen goes out on deck to avoid Bolte, Karl succeeds in meeting her. These scenes are fairly well filmed and the color effects are capital. Karl, played by Ralph Forbes, is a handsome fellow. So soon as he knows that Bolte is Helen's husband he realizes that the marriage is not to her liking.Later these passengers are perceived on the river boat, and when that craft reaches Neu Posen. Bolte stands on the aft deck hoping to make all the German officers envious of his attractive bride. He later gives a feast and takes good care to make a show of his wealth, even to having a procession of natives carrying the viands.A visit from a native woman interrupts the proceedings, and in a subsequent passage Bolte, enraged with his wife, is about to flog her with a whip when Karl comes to the rescue. All this happens just ???pried to the World War, and in the closing chapters word is received by both the Germans and the British that hostilities have been declared.Bolte, the snake, believes that money can buy his freedom from military service, but soon he learns otherwise. He is compelled to don a uniform and then decides to run away. His end is sudden, for he fires at one group of natives without knowing that others are behind him. They know something about Bolte and his pleas for his life fall on deaf ears.There follow episodes in which Karl goes to the rescue of Helen and others, who are in danger of an attack by the natives. These are pictured with due attention for red blood on the hero's shirt. It seems that the Britishers might have been more solicitous about Karl's wounds, but all the British commandant says when he comes up to Karl is to ask him whether he will have another Piccadilly cigarette.Miss Boardman is charming and always attractively gowned, as every heroine must be in such a drama. Sometimes she gives more thought to her appearance than to the predicament in which she, as Helen, finds herself.The dialogue fits the vehicle, but it cannot be accused of any subtlety or brilliance.

Market Place","excerpt":"A Profit Squeeze In TV Retailing"},{"year":"1991","title":"GOVERNMENTS like to try to keep the value of their currencies stable. To do that, they buy and sell their currencies in the world's $600 billion-a-day foreign exchange market and coordinate their economic policies with one another. Corporations with large sales or operations abroad do not like volatility in the foreign exchange market either. It makes it difficult for them to produce relatively stable quarterly earnings.   But foreign exchange traders love movement: it is a time to make money, not only from trading one currency for another but also from hedging for corporations seeking to protect themselves from the impact of volatility.   Since 1973, when the world abandoned its post-World War II system of fixed exchange rates in favor of the current floating exchange-rate system, traders -- not governments -- have been getting their way. The markets have been volatile. From the beginning of this year until July, the dollar rose 27 percent against the German mark. In the last three weeks, the dollar has fallen 5 percent against the mark. In the same period, the dollar has moved up sharply against most other currencies.   The quarterly reports for the banks that are active traders in the foreign exchange market show that volatility has been good for them. Foreign exchange revenues for the first quarter, when the dollar was most volatile, were up 27 percent to $701 million for the 15 major trading banks in the United States, according to figures compiled by Shearson Lehman Brothers. Two Who Have Won J.P. Morgan and Bankers Trust    For dozens of banks, revenue from foreign exchange operations has become much more important as other areas of their business have suffered. Banks earn fees on foreign exchange services for corporate customers and profit from daily and long-term trading, often with their own money. Fee-based operations, which carry less risk for the bank, are growing. This makes revenue from the category \\"foreign exchange\\" more reliable and stable than its name might otherwise imply.    James M. Rosenberg, a banking analyst at Shearson, has used this argument as the basis of his decision to raise the ratings recently of the stock of Bankers Trust Company and J.P. Morgan & Company. Both banks actively conduct trading and hedging operations for their clients. Mr. Rosenberg said this dependable stream of earnings means the banks' stocks were \\"materially undervalued.\\"    In the first half of this year, J.P. Morgan, the parent of Morgan Guaranty Trust, had revenue from foreign exchange of $149 million, or 30 percent of net income. Bankers Trust did better, with revenue from foreign exchange of $182 million or 53 percent of net income.    \\"The balance has shifted a bit more toward customers,\\" said Peter D. Hancock, the managing director for global markets at J.P.  Morgan. \\"There is a recognition of the important niche that Morgan holds because of its customer franchise. But this is not to say that we do not have a certain appetite for risk.\\"  What Customers Want The Biggest Banks Are Most Popular    With so many banks competing for business, which ones do corporations prefer? In foreign exchange, it does not hurt to be big. Of the top five banks rated as best by corporate treasurers and other customers in Euromoney magazine, four -- Citicorp, Barclays Bank, National Westminster and Union Bank of Switzerland -- are among the 30 largest banks in the world. Morgan Guaranty Trust, rated third, is 59th in assets worldwide.    The Euromoney list also showed that investment banks are making their mark. Goldman Sachs & Company and Morgan Stanley & Company are now rated among the world's 20 most preferred currency traders.   But the credit ratings of the banks themselves also seem to play a role in why some are favored. The banks that rose in the rankings -- like J.P. Morgan, which went from eighth place to third, and Union Bank of Switzerland, which went from 17th to fifth -- both had credit ratings from the Standard and Poor's Corporation of AAA, five levels higher than the rating for Chemical Bank, which fell from third to seventh, and Chase Manhattan, which fell from sixth to 14th in the rankings. These higher ratings bring in customers who are concerned about the state of the banking system and want to do their longer-term transactions with banks considered healthy.    The credit rating issue is very important to the new foreign exchange operations that will be created at the merged Chemical Bank and Manufacturers Hanover Trust.    In comments to analysts, John McGillicuddy, who will be chairman of the combined bank, made clear that the key to improving the new bank's foreign exchange revenues will be to make the financial moves necessary to raise the bank's credit rating first to an A and then to an AA.    \\"We really have professionals that can execute in these areas if we give them an improved rating to operate with,\\" Mr. McGillicuddy told the analysts. \\"There are several banking institutions in this city, for example, that really kind of have the field to themselves right now, and it's not, in our judgment, because they're better than we are.\\" Traders Without Jobs Cost Cutting In Currency Units     The explosive growth of the foreign currency market in the 1980's brought new banks and scores of new traders into the business. Now they are elbowing each other for a share. At the same time, cost cutting in the banking industry has spread even to lucrative areas like foreign exchange. Traders are beginning to feel the pain.   A few foreign banks, like Hill Samuel International of Britain, have closed their New York foreign exchange operations. On the West Coast, the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group and Barclays Bank of Britain have closed their operations.    The New York market is especially tight. At Union Bank of Switzerland and many other banks, managers do not move quickly to replace traders who have left.   \\"Traders are suffering for the first time,\\" said David Rivers, the executive editor of FX Week, a newsletter for currency traders.   Anthony G. Mecca, a former foreign exchange trader turned headhunter, said job listings are down about 40 percent from a year ago. He has had to turn the efforts of his own firm, the Paulen Company, toward other kinds of job searches because of the slowdown.    \\"A lot of the people who were unemployed last summer are still unemployed,\\" he said, adding that he has seen more than 30 traders this year who had lost their jobs.   One of the reasons for the cutbacks, beyond cost, is that the boom in foreign exchange trading in the 1980's brought a lot of people into the market who are having trouble handling the business today.    \\"The 1980's brought in a lot of people who were not up to the quality and talent that you need today,\\" said Robert A. White, vice president at First Interstate Bank in Los Angeles. He said increased volatility and quick changes in the direction of the foreign exchange market make it much more difficult to make money now than when the dollar was generally going down every day in the mid- and late 1980's.    Traders hired now tend to be more experienced. \\"I would look for seasoned traders with a good track record,\\" said Albert Soria, foreign exchange manager at Kansallis-Osake-Pankki, a Finnish bank in New York. \\"And a good track record does not mean volatile earnings. A good track record would mean an upward slope in earnings.\\"    The threat of more bank mergers, like the joining of Chemical and Manufacturers Hanover, means there could be other traders on the street soon looking for jobs. Mr. Mecca believes Chemical has the stronger foreign exchange operation, which means it will be dominant in the combining of the companies' operations. But he believes David Puth, manager of foreign exchange at Chemical, will run counter to the rule in the market and take younger people so he can train them. This time \\"I think you will see a lot of senior people out on the street,\\" he said. A bank spokesman, Joyce Oberdorf, said the bank will train younger traders, \\"but not at the expense of senior people.\\"   For one senior trader in particular, the situation is a little queasy. J. Thomas Stanley, who was vice president and manager for corporate exchange at Chemical Bank, left three months ago. He left to do the same job at Manufacturers Hanover Trust. At this time, Mr. Stanley has no comment about his future. THE DUAL ROLE OF OPTIONS    ON the floor of the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and in banks and investment banks around the world, currency options are being used increasingly to hedge against foreign-exchange losses.    Currency options are a type of right. They give their owners the opportunity to buy a unit of a currency at a prearranged price sometime in the future. As a result, they are an insurance policy against unwanted or unanticipated moves in the foreign exchange market. Options are traded on exchanges in a number of standard forms or individually crafted for special customer needs by banks and investment banks.    While options offer protection, they also give companies the opportunity to take advantage of a positive move. The cost of combining insurance and opportunity is much higher than traditional forms of hedging, which use forwards -- contracts to buy currencies in the future at current price.   Forwards also offer insurance against adverse moves by locking in an exchange rate, but they offer no chance for gains. According to International Risk Control Inc., a foreign exchange consulting firm in Redwood City, Calif., a three-month option can cost four times more than a forward contract or about 3 percent of face value.    Even though options are more expensive, their use is growing. According to Greenwich Associates, a foreign exchange consulting firm in Greenwich, Conn., companies that use options spent a median of $150 million on them last year, up from $90 million the year before.

That was better than the stock market did in 1990 and much bettter than the bond markets did in 1989.    Rising interest rates sent bond prices down sharply in Germany and Japan. But already high and relatively stable interest rates -- in Britain, Australia, Spain and Italy -- brought in strong returns for investors. In Australia, Spain and Italy, government bond buyers got extra help as rates declined, pushing bond prices up and giving bonds in those markets the only capital gains for the year in the 11 countries that make up the J.
