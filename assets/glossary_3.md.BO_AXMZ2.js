Such strength undermines the case that the Federal Reserve needs to cut short-term interest rates to stimulate economic growth. The bond and stock markets had been betting on lower interest rates, and the employment report sent them tumbling today.

So where to find leaves and moldings -- along with baseboards, corbels and medallions -- stylish enough to transform a lackluster studio into an Art Deco salon? Mr. Weiner went to Hyde Park Fine Art of Moldings in Long Island City, Queens, for plaster dentil molding (www.hyde-park.com","excerpt":"718-706-0504).

Everything in this determinedly scandalous exhibition by young artists is for sale, though it's hard to imagine who would want a street canoe made of detritus from under the Queensboro Bridge, assembled by the Parfyme Deluxe artist team, above. Nearby, a video shows the artists foot-pedaling their canoe through Brooklyn. (No license was required to ride it on the roads, the gallery's director said, because with three wheels, it evidently counted as a bicycle.) More video art follows, beginning with a three-channel piece by Ondrej Brody and Kristofer Paetau, in which actors in a sealed room are shown performing raunchy acts at the request of the artists, communicating by cellphone. In the back room is a renegade installation -- a vast accumulation of junk and rubbish, mostly -- by Marc Grubstein, David Henry Brown and Chad Spicer. This sprawling dyspeptic picnic is about the dark side of the American suburban idyll. On occasion, even this space requires tidying: the day I visited, the artists had just finished cleaning up to stave off vermin.

Compact ultraviolet light bulbs jutting from a false ceiling -- about three feet high -- produce an even daylight effect, intended to assist easy viewing of the arctic topography. But the installation, ''High Plane V'' (2006), above, works best when two people mount the ladders and poke their head in at the same time: then they can both see a disembodied head floating in the middle of the icy landscape. The experience is freaky and even a bit dizzying, though that might also have something to do with the overpowering paint fumes. It helps to know that the artist is from Iceland, though these days she lives in New York and has her studio just down the street from P.S. 1. From one part of her studio's building, she can just make out the legs and bodies of visitors up the ladders, viewing her handiwork.

How would I select a good tailor in Hong Kong? -- Louise Stanton, Princeton, N.J.     A.  One place to start is a guide issued by the Hong Kong Tourist Association. The free listing of services at member shops, compiled by the Government-sponsored body, includes about 140 tailors in Hong Kong and Kowloon. The association will investigate any difficulties tourists encounter and will help seek redress of any complaints. The guide, which is not available in the United States, may be picked up at the association's offices at Jardine House, 1 Connaught Place, in the Central district. The association logo, a red Chinese sailing junk, is displayed on members' windows.   In general, you should find a tailor as soon as you arrive so the work can begin and the fittings can be arranged -- there should be at least two, except for shirts, which require just one.    While most Hong Kong tailors are familiar with classic suit and shirt styles, if you should take along apparel in other styles you want copied.    Experienced Hong Kong shoppers say that while tailors in prestigious hotels or shopping spots such as the Prince's Building in the Central district or Ocean Terminal in Kowloon, tend to be more expensive than others, they also tend to be among the best. And, because these tailors have had extensive experience dealing with tourists, they are generally more adept at understanding, fitting and pleasing Western customers.   Here are recommendations from Barbara Basler, who frequently writes for The Times from Hong Kong:   Ascot Chang, known for its men's shirts, which begin at about $65, has a shop in the Peninsula Hotel (Salisbury Road, Tsim Sha Tsui, Kowloon","excerpt":"721-2080) and in the arcade of the Regent Hotel (Salisbury Road, Tsim Sha Tsui, Kowloon; 367-8319).    One of Hong Kong's finest tailors, A. Man Hing Cheong, is in the Mandarin Oriental Hotel (5 Connaught Road, Central; 522-3336). A suit would begin at around $400.    There are some expert tailors in seedy commercial buildings, but you should try such places only if you have a recommendation from someone you trust. The De-Luxe Tailor Shop (Room 704 of the aptly named Modest Building at 58 Stanley Street, Central; 522-9645), popular with expatriate executives, offers fine suits at about $275. Across the harbor, in an equally unassuming building, William Cheng & Son (Han Hing Mansion, Eighth Floor, 38 Hankow Road, Tsim Sha Tsui; 366-0709) has built up a following for its well-made men's cotton dress shirt for only $23. Warwick Meyers recently moved to a more mainstream location (401 Parker House, 72 Queens Road, Fourth Floor, Central; 522-0896) but has kept its reasonable prices -- a wool suit starts at about $260.  Lynchburg, Tenn., Recipes    Q.     I enjoyed Florence Fabricant's story on Lynchburg, Tenn., \\"A Simple, Sober Town\\" (Travel, Feb. 17). The descriptions of the old-fashioned food made me hungry. Any chance of getting recipes? -- Abbey Rose Horesta, Clifton, N.J.      A.  The article, about the town where Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whisky is distilled, mentioned the cooking at Miss Mary Bobo's Boarding House there. There are two cookbooks containing recipes used at Mary Bobo's. One, published in 1988 by Rutledge Hill Press, is \\"Jack Daniel's Spirit of Tennessee Cookbook,\\" by Pat Mitchamore and Lynne Tolley. It includes recipes for tipsy sweet potatoes, intoxicated chicken and Jack Daniel's caramel sauce, among others. (While Lynchburg prohibits the sale or serving of alcohol, it does not ban its use in cooking.) The authors' other book, \\"Jack Daniel's Hometown Celebration Cookbook,\\" published last year by Rutledge Hill, contains new recipes from Mary Bobo's along with favorites of Lynchburg cooks.   Among the recipes are busy-day brisket, country sausage muffins and frozen Jack Daniel's pecan pie.   Each book costs $19.95, and they are available in B. Dalton Booksellers and Waldenbooks. The boarding house will mail books for $20 for each. Contact Lynne Tolley, Miss Mary Bobo's Boarding House, Lynchburg, Tenn. 37352; (615) 759-7394.  Directory of Dorm Rooms    Q.     Is there a directory of colleges that make dormitories available for tourists? -- June Westervelt George, Amherst, Mass.     A.  \\"U.S. and Worldwide Travel Accommodations Guide,\\" published by Campus Travel Service, lists 375 American colleges and universities that offer summer accommodations in residence halls for $12 to $24 a person a day. Some offer dormitory rooms year round. The publisher says the average price is $16 a day. Listed with each entry is whether food service is available, nearby activities and such information as whether children are permitted, rules regarding smoking and alcohol and linen charges. Also listed are 94 Y.M.C.A.'s that offer lodging. The guide also lists about 340 of university accommodations in Canada, Europe, Australia and New Zealand, averaging $18 a night.   Copies of the guide are available for $13 from Campus Travel Service, Post Office Box 8355, Newport Beach, Calif. 92669. Add $1.50 for first-class postage. French Phone Cards    Q.     I have heard that there is a variety of pictures on phone cards from France. Is this so? How can I purchase some for collecting? -- Herbert Moore, Carmel, N.Y.     A.  Telecartes are used in newer public telephones in France in place of coins. They are bought in units of 50 or 120 domestic calls and are used until their value is used up. The cards are sold in France at post offices, cafes and tobacconists. They are indeed issued with a variety of images -- famous people like President Francois Mitterrand of France or Princess Stephanie of Monaco, activities like skiing or cycling or corporate logos -- and there is a growing number of collectors.   Telecartes are sold in the United States by Marketing Challenges International, 10 East 21st Street, New York, N.Y. 10010; (212) 529-8484. They are sold only in 50-call units, for $12 apiece (they are about $8 in France), plus a $5 handling charge with each order. The company currently has on hand cards with an image of Sacre-Coeur, and will get new cards with different images when those run out. The cards are meant to be bought before a trip to France, but the company recommends that collectors call perhaps once a month to check if new cards have arrived. Also, the company plans to order some limited-edition cards and, on request, to search for specific cards from France.

The pollution, known as Arctic haze, covers much of the area. Since the blue-gray haze was noticed in the 1950's, it has steadily worsened, and at times during the winter and spring it rivals pollution levels in large cities.    The study, which appears in the current issue of the journal Nature, supports a widely held belief that industrial pollutants in the Northern Hemisphere, particularly from Europe and Asia, are funneled by weather patterns into the Arctic. Previous studies have traced particles in the haze to industrial areas in the Soviet Union","excerpt":"75 percent of the land above the Arctic Circle is in the Soviet Union.    In the latest study, researchers at the National Water Research Institute and the Atmospheric Environment Service in Canada found that the composition of sulfur particles, a primary pollutant in the haze, matches those in Scandinavia, not those in southern Canada.    The isotopes of sulfur, a byproduct of smelting or the burning of fossil fuels, vary according to the source, giving researchers a signature to trace, said Dr. Jerome O. Nriagu, the principal author of the report.    \\"The signature of the isotopes convinces us that it has to be from Europe and not North America,\\" Dr. Nriagu said.   \\"People think of the Arctic as being clean and unspoiled,\\" he said. \\"It is not really pristine anymore.

But the United States is missing from the list.   Despite the Bush Administration's absence of leadership on the convention, it has generated strong bipartisan support in both houses of Congress. In September, the Senate passed Resolution 231, urging the President to send the convention to the Senate for speedy ratification. This resolution was introduced by Senators Bill Bradley and Richard G. Lugar, co-chairmen of the Advisory Council on the Rights of the Child. In the House, Resolution 312, introduced by Representatives Gus Yatron and Doug Bereuter, was also passed.   In New York City, the convention has special import. On Nov. 21, 1989, the City Council passed a resolution pledging to uphold the convention as law for city agencies. The Board of Education, in a September 1990 resolution, affirmed the significance of the convention for educators.   It would be irresponsible to dissipate the momentum of this movement for the protection and empowerment of children -- which now spans local and international concerns. It is important that those interested write to the President, urging him to send the Convention on the Rights of the Child to the Senate with a request for its speedy ratification.
