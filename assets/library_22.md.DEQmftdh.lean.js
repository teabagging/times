WHEN Tony Baekeland, great-grandson of the man who made millions by inventing the first commercially successful plastic, stabbed his mother to death in 1972, it was the final chapter in a family saga with plot twists worthy of ''Dynasty'' - or perhaps Tennessee Williams. For one, there was Tony's homosexuality","excerpt":"by 14 he was seducing other boys. While Tony's sexual preferences are not so remarkable, his mother's response was: she tried, it seems, to save Tony from his homosexuality by seducing him. Then, when Tony finally managed to bring home a girlfriend, his father ran off with her.   The murder sent ripples through the ranks of a glittery crowd. Tony's mother, Barbara Baekeland, had once been engaged to John Jacob Astor, and spent most of her time in social pursuit of the rich, the famous and the gifted. It is this same rather glamorous circle of friends and acquaintances who, through their own testimony, tell the tale of the Baekeland family in ''Savage Grace,'' by Natalie Robins and Steven M. L.

Introduced during the wave of Westernization that followed the Meiji Restoration in 1868, the coffee shop has come to play a unique role in Japanese urban life. The first coffee shop in Tokyo opened in 1888, but soon closed","excerpt":"by 1897 there were 143 shops in Tokyo alone. Like baseball, it has become a Japanese institution. As with other institutions here, ritual goes hand in hand with quality. Japan is one place where you can feel confident of finding a good cup of coffee -- freshly brewed, strong and fragrant -- in almost any town or village big enough to have a single coffee shop. In the smallest, sleepiest towns it is an assertion of urban sophistication that defies its surroundings.\\n\\nBut the coffee shop as institution provides more than coffee. Contemporary urban life in Japan creates a strong need for solace from the pressures of everyday life. Social, personal and business relationships are built on a base of interlocking obligations so complex and so firmly fixed that even the Japanese become exhausted by them. The lack of privacy in a city apartment adds weight to the burden. Without bedrooms set apart from the common living space, with nothing separating one room from another but paper or the thinnest wallboard partitions, it is impossible to have a private conversation, and difficult to write a letter or read a book undisturbed. In addition, hot, humid summers and cold, damp winters are to be endured without respite only by the most stoic. For those who work in major cities, long daily commutes increase the need for a comfortable stopping place. The high price of a cup of perfectly made coffee ($2.70 to $3.50 is standard in Tokyo, somewhat less in Kyoto; cheaper specials are often available at breakfast time) reflects not merely the cost of coffee and the care invested in preparing it, but is also rent paid on a space where you can enjoy an hour or two of unpressured leisure or uninterrupted business.

Over the years, American collectors have become familiar with some of the label's wares - particularly recordings by such ensembles as the Deller and Clemencic consorts -through licensing arrangements Harmonia Mundi has maintained with the Musical Heritage Society and other small labels. Many of these budget-priced domestic versions remain available, and the interest they have created has led many a collector to investigate either the original pressings or other performances from the Harmonia Mundi catalogue.   Finding the label's releases, however, has not always been easy, since their availability even in import and specialty shops has been sporadic. Fortunately, all that is changing. Last April, the label incorporated an American branch, Harmonia Mundi USA, based on the West Coast (2351 Westwood Boulevard, Los Angeles, Calif. 90064).  Since then, the entire catalogue has been available here, with two or three new disks added every month.

It should not be so.   Think of it. Not the ending of a century, though it is that as well, but the end of a millennium and the beginning of the next.

With a bit of movie magic to assist him, Charlie seems to be almost completely independent of his ventriloquacious master. There's one scene—when he is being bundled in newspaper—where he plays so many non-puppetlike tricks that we half expected to see him break the wrappings and scamper away under a smoke screen of back-talk. By the strictest narrative standards, Charlie's frequent interruptions of the story's course are inexcusable","excerpt":"by amusement standards, they were all for the best.For, when you get right down to it, \\"Letter of Introduction\\" is dancing on a fragile tightrope. Andrea Leeds is the baby daughter Adolphe Menjou had astonishingly forgotten during the twenty-year interlude between his first wife and his fourth. She has a letter of introduction to remind him of the relationship; she has designs on a stage career herself; she has, ultimately, a hotheaded young man—call him George Murphy—who quite naturally misunderstands the strange affinity between the girl and the scandalous Great Lover of stage and screen. Misunderstandings of this sort can, unless the writers and directors have a way with them, lead to the most tiresome business.But, happily, the writers and directors had that way. If the expected happens, at least it happens unexpectedly. The girl's debut is not as you might have surmised. The answer to the parentage problem—for, after all, no matinee idol is anxious to admit a grown daughter—is concealed skillfully. Mr. Murphy's doubts are held to a dramatic minimum. And all the while, with deft bits of business—satirical, tragic, comic and sentimental—the tale keeps spinning and never lets you realize how frail it is. Which is simply a roundabout way of saying it's a good job. P. S.—Eve Arden, Rita Johnson, Ernest Cossart and Ann Sheridan do very nicely too.

A lettuce called iceberg, developed by some smart lettuce breeder, has cooled the heat of our stomachs generation upon generation. A green garden salad of many lettuces is still a sight for hot eyes and parched tongues on a summer's day, but enough already. The Salad Revolution is upon us and, as thousands of saladbar troops have discovered, lettuce is only a dodge to maneuver a full meal onto your plate.   Salads have not only taken over the main course, they've declared their independence from the rest of the meal. Particularly among the vegetarian or health-conscious young, the one-dish salad bowl is the meal. If lettuce, or fresh crispy greens of any kind, cools the stomach, a cold salad array cools the cook. Our forebears, who celebrated Fourth of July picnics with long trestle tables loaded with cole slaws and chicken salads and macaroni salads and potato salads and, yes, sometimes those Jell-O salads with names like Frou-Frou and Lollipop and Marshmallow Dream, knew what they were about. Independence Day meant independence from a hot stove.

Many other weeds are far more detrimental in that they compete with food crops for available light, water and nutrients, and, unless controlled, reduce the food available to feed the hungry people of the world.   Someone once defined a weed as any plant that is growing where it is not wanted, and that definition has stuck. By such reasoning, the dandelion grown for greens on a South Jersey truck farm is a vegetable not a weed, and crabgrass growing on a barren hillside might well be considered nature's first line of defense against erosion.

The measured strikes by the U.S., France and Britain at air defense targets in southern Iraq should have been no surprise to anyone, least of all Saddam Hussein.   It would be surprising, however, if the attacks achieved the stated goal of persuading Saddam Hussein to stop attempting to undermine the territorial and military terms imposed by the victors in the Persian Gulf war. For him, the benefits of showing the Arab world he can still thumb his nose at the West outweigh the costs of losing a few radar and missile sites.   Soon -- within a few months, at best -- Mr. Hussein will resume his nibbling. Then the allies, including the new team in Washington, will respond, as they must, with air strikes against targets that he values more. Those responses are unlikely to be decisive, and the round of move and countermove will continue.    Saddam Hussein and the coalition are locked in a ritual dance from which there is no easy exit. The coalition will thus pay a price for failing to press the 1991 war to the point of toppling him. But at that time carrying the ground war into Baghdad's streets seemed likely to cost too many coalition and Iraqi lives and to be unnecessary. Surely, it was assumed, the Iraqi armed forces, with critical help from Washington, would purge the leader who had brought them so catastrophic a defeat. That calculation did not reckon with Mr. Hussein's ability to coerce continued loyalty from an inner circle ruthless enough to suppress opposition.    The means of persuasion at the coalition's disposal today are far fewer than they were two years ago. Renewing the ground war is not among them. Nor need it be: the available instruments are sufficient to get two clear messages across.    The first message is for the Iraqi military establishment. Deprived of modern air defenses, its forces are acutely vulnerable to air attack. It should understand that the strikes will continue, and be more and more costly, until the nibbling stops.    The second message is the same, but it is for the Iraqi people. The coalition will not attack them directly. Nor does it want to attack military targets in their midst. But the Iraqis should realize that the comfortable life they enjoyed before 1990 will be impossible so long as Saddam Hussein continues his provocations. That means maintaining the blockade, at least to the point where only essential medical supplies and foods can enter Iraq. It means continuing the embargo on oil sales and thus denying Iraq the money needed to import anything of value. For middle- and upper-class Iraqis, it means no travel abroad.   Such responses should lead the Iraqi military and people to realize that time is not on Saddam Hussein's side. Obviously, the coalition cannot stop all embargo- and blockade-busting. But sufficient pressure can be maintained for a very long time, particularly if substantial oil sales are prevented.    Iraqis must realize that Mr. Hussein has reduced Iraq to the status of marginal actor in the Middle East","excerpt":"by continuing to exert steady military, political and economic pressure, the coalition can insure that it will remain one. Mr. Hussein's posturing in the prison he has made of his country should not prevent the Clinton Administration and its allies from focusing on the issue that will most affect the Middle East's future stability: the continuing effort to bring about peace between Israel and its neighbors.

Indeed, the two have often seemed completely at odds - modernism summons up associations of sleek, hard materials, cool surfaces devoid of ornament","excerpt":"by contrast, the image of a luxurious French restaurant is of a soft, plushy kind of luxury, of surfaces upholstered and decorated. It is no surprise, then, that most new French restaurants in the luxury class have tended to look like their predecessors, for contemporary architecture has until recently provided them with no way of meeting their needs. The only way such restaurants have had to provide the symbols that they require has been to fall back on imitation.   It is for this reason that the opening of the new quarters of Le Cygne is an important event in New York restaurant design: it marks the first time the demands of a French restaurant in the classical mold have been satisfied by a work of contemporary architecture, and not a piece of tiresome imitation. Le Cygne is the product of Voorsanger & Mills, a firm of young New York architects whose work is among the most promising to be seen in this city; although the firm's designs are not easily categorized, they are probably better placed under the general term ''post-modernist'' than anything else.

The plan assumed that the Kurds would soon feel secure enough to return home, and that the camps, only temporary resting places, would then be dissolved.   But nearly three weeks after the President announced his plan, neither the Administration nor the United Nations has the vaguest idea of when the United Nations will assume full responsiblity for the camps, whether the Kurds will feel safe after the allied troops leave, whether the United Nations will authorize a police force for the camps, and who will foot the bill.

From there, centuries later, it passed into the hands of Prince Wladyslaw, founder of the monastery at Josna Gora, a Marian sanctuary in Czestochowa, Poland.

The new head has little impact on other scientific data except that it is ''much more similar to the diplodocus head,'' said Professor Ostrom, referring to another species of dinosaur with a dissimilar body.

A Governor for Hard Winters"},{"year":"1997","title":"MARKETS  Tilting at Exuberance Again  Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, was wearing his Cassandra hat in public again last week. In testimony before Congress, Mr. Greenspan returned to the themes of his famous December ''irrational exuberance'' speech, calling any hopes that the stock market will continue to roar upward at its recent pace unrealistic and warning that inflation remained a looming threat. As usual, he avoided saying definitely whether an interest-rate increase was in the offing, but investors took his remarks to heart and pushed stock and bond prices down.    MORE IS MORE  Buying the Competition  Federal Express struck a deal to expand into trucking and logistics by agreeing to buy Caliber for $2.7 billion, thereby also acquiring RPS, a big competitor in the business-to-business end of the speedy delivery market. One reason Caliber may have looked especially tempting to the generally acquisition-shy Fedex: Like Fedex (but unlike U.P.S.), Caliber is nonunion. . . . Not long ago, the North Fork Bancorporation had a half-dozen branches and a chairman trying to control costs by telling workers to make do with one pen and one pencil apiece. With a deal last week to buy New York Bancorp for $800 million, its ninth acquisition in as many years, North Fork will become the biggest bank on Long Island, and a serious competitor in the retail backyard of the giant New York City banks -- maybe serious enough to get itself bought in turn.    LESS IS MORE  Addition by Subtraction  Fed up with trying to persuade the market that its highly profitable finance arm ought to make its stock worth a lot more, the Ford Motor Company decided to hand over its 80.7 percent stake in Associates First Capital to Ford shareholders. The almost $18 billion spinoff accounts for nearly a third of Ford's market value but less than one-twelfth of its second-quarter profits. . . . Champion International also felt the urge to become a purer play, saying it would sell off roughly a quarter of the company to concentrate on coated papers, unbleached paperboard, softwood timberland and distribution. Analysts said Champion could net about $1.1 billion, including the sale of 325,000 acres of timberland, much of it in the environmentally and politically sensitive Adirondack Park in upstate New York.    TECHNOLOGY STOCKS  Sell on 'Oops,' Buy on Thud  A tale of two losses: On Monday, Silicon Graphics brought investors up short with word that it expected to report a loss for the quarter ended Sept. 30. The market, noting that the company's previous quarter was gangbusters and its competitors in the client-server business are thriving, reacted by hacking a third off its share price. On Tuesday evening, the chip maker Advanced Micro Devices reported an even bigger loss than analysts had been expecting since the company gave warning a month ago. Did the market mind? Not for long. After a rough morning, the stock rallied to close higher and rose again the next day.    SAFETY  Lock and Unload  The stories are heartbreakers: Children find their parents' handgun in the dresser drawer, they play with it and one winds up maimed or dead. Those stories ought to be growing rarer by the end of next year, when the manufacturers of most handguns made in the United States say they will be shipping all new handguns with a child-safety lock. . . . Chrysler continues to be haunted by allegations of defective rear door latches in the 4.1 million of its mini-vans built before 1996. A Federal jury in Charleston, S.C., awarded $262.5 million to the family of a six-year-old boy thrown from a mini-van in a 1994 traffic accident. Chrysler has a program to replace the latches but has not formally recalled the mini-vans. The company says it will appeal the verdict.    CURRENCY UNION  The Euro's Bitter Medicine  Getting Europe's economies synchronized for the introduction of the planned common currency in 1999 is proving painful. Germany's central bank felt compelled to head off any hint of inflation with a surprise interest-rate increase, its first tightening in more than five years, despite slow growth and record unemployment rolls. Five neighboring countries swiftly followed suit. In Italy, the center-left coalition Government of Romano Pradi, struggling to trim its too-big-for-the-Euro budget deficit, found itself cutting social welfare spending too deeply for the Communist Party to tolerate. Loss of the Communists' votes in Parliament brought down the Government.    SOUTHEAST ASIA  Indonesia Calls for Help  Long discredited in geopolitics, the domino theory seems to be reappearing in geofinance. Some of the same pressures that toppled the Thai baht over the summer have since set Indonesia's currency to teetering. Indonesia still has substantial reserves of foreign exchange, but the writing on the wall looked dire enough last week to prompt a request for standby aid from the International Monetary Fund to help stabilize the rupiah. Two more hard-hit currency dominoes, the Malaysian ringgit and Philippine peso, managed gains last week.    ACCUSATIONS  All the Way to the Top?  The senior F.B.I. agent in the investigation of possible fraud at Columbia/HCA, the nation's biggest hospital chain, called what the Government has uncovered so far a ''systematic corporate scheme'' perpetrated by senior executives -- and not an isolated error or aberration. The chain's billing and accounting practices may not ultimately prove to have been criminally improper, analysts said, but at the least, the company's defenses against pending shareholder lawsuits appear badly undermined by the contents of a 75-page affidavit partly unsealed last week. Neither the company nor its battered stock showed much reaction.    COINCIDENCES  There's That Word Again  What's hot, black, caffeinated and seemed to figure in every other headline last week? In politics, the long-running Washington donnybrook over campaign finance flared up when videotapes, shot at the famous White House coffees for high-rolling contributors, materialized belatedly. In Silicon Valley, Sun Microsystems sued Microsoft and threatened to yank its license to use Sun's Java programming language on the assertion that Microsoft had twisted Java into another way to seal the hegemony of its Windows operating system. In media, the editor of The Los Angeles Times, Shelby Coffey 3d, resigned, denying that he was driven out by corporate plans to give marketing executives unprecedented sway in the newsroom.

Though all of these portraits are based on photographs, they have all been redrawn and repainted to conform to the conventions of Indian painting. In ''Landowner Who Loves Music,'' the example shown on this page, the landowner's face, hands and feet have been tinted, as they might have been in a European portrait of the period.  However, his clothes, chair and musical instrument have been ornamented with little dabs and squiggles of paint that emphasize flat patterns rather than volumes, and the floor has been completely repainted in the Indian manner, eliminating the perspective of the original photograph. The painter has, so to speak, tilted the floor up until it is parallel to the background and picture plane, showing it as it would look if seen from directly above rather than from the same angle as the sitter and his chair.

The first exhibition, organized by William Ewing of I.C.P., features the work of Heinrich Kuhn, a pre-World War I art photographer associated with the painters of the Munich Secession and, through Alfred Stieglitz, with the American Photo-Secession. The other exhibition, organized by Van Deren Coke of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, is a group show of some 50 photographers active in Germany during the Weimar Republic. Together, they demonstrate that the history of early 20th-century photography in Germany is not all that different from the history of early 20th-century photography in America.

Produced under Russian supervision, this DEFA film presents a drab account of life against the now familiar background of bombed-out buildings and mounds of rubble. Without reaching a dramatic point, the picture touches on black marketeering, the disintegration of parental authority and the despond which engulfs a soldier on his return home from a prisoner of war camp. Running off in so many directions, the script is inconclusive.As samples of wild and hungry German youth, the boys are too respectful in the presence of adults and look too well fed to be convincing. Gerhard Lamprecht, who wrote and directed \\"Somewhere in Berlin,\\" apparently intended some significant symbolism judging by the attention he gives to the zest with which they play war games with stolen rockets and other fireworks.

Being less gullible than the weather man, however, we must offer the paradoxical observation that \\"One Rainy Afternoon\\" is fair and mild—a bit too mild for the purposes of rollicking French farce and merely fair enough to provide an hour or so of moderate entertainment.Our feeling about the picture is that it never is quite as gay as Francis Lederer would have us believe, nor quite as silly as Hugh Herbert pretends, nor quite as romantic as the women in the crowd scenes seem to think. It offers a rather amusing opening incident and then, obviously pleased with its happy inspiration, retells it at intervals, each time with less and less effectiveness, until we find ourselves asking whether it was funny in the first place.The incident, or series of minor incidents, is a diverting specimen of farce invention. Francis Lederer, as a minor Parisian actor, has a rendezvous in a motion-picture theatre with a married woman. Her ticket calls for Seat 68, his for Seat 66. But an usher turns his ticket upside down, seats him in 99, next to Miss Ida Lupino, and—carried away by the romantic duet on the screen and mistaking the identity of his neighbor in the darkened cinema—Mr. Lederer kisses the blonde stranger. She screams, slaps his face and almost at once is surrounded by a roving committee from the Society for the Protection of Public Morals. There are cries of \\"fiend\\" \\"monster\\" and \\"attacks\\" and Mr. Lederer is haled to court.The trial scene is amusingly handled, with Miss Lupino as a reluctant witness for the prosecution and Mr. Lederer, to shield his inamorata from scandal, resting his case on the traditional gallantry and romantic impressionability of the French. His defense converts him into a hero in the eyes of the matrons of Paris and photographers continue to dog the charming monster's footsteps, following a trail which leads unerringly back to Miss Lupino and to a series of other osculatory \\"attacks.\\"The ingenuity of the authors was spent after the court room scene, however, and the second half of the picture is a rather sharp letdown. Mr. Lederer, the bouncing Czech, splashes charm all over the place, but runs a definite second to the quieter and vastly more attractive Miss Lupino, who impressed us as having her tongue in her cheek even while registering love's sweet surrender. The supporting rôles are capably filled by Erik Rhodes, in his usual excitable mood, as Miss Lupino's abused fiancé","excerpt":"by Hugh Herbert, struggling under some idiotic lines; by Roland Young as a theatre manager, and Joseph Cawthorn, Donald Meek, Georgia Caine, Richard Carle and others.A special paragraph must be devoted to a lovely and interesting newcomer, the Countess Liev de Maigret, who appears too briefly as the discreet and timorous woman of Mr. Lederer's cinema rendezvous.

The Ciba-Geigy Corporation, which collects an average of 10 tons of recyclable material each month in the county, was the host for the seminar, sponsored by the Westchester County Association, the county government and Inform, a nonprofit environmental-research group based in Manhattan.    A series of speakers from industry and government outlined what they perceived as a growing crisis and then spoke about the role businesses played in generating waste and in disposing of it. The Waste Stream Is Growing     \\"It is a crisis,\\" emphasized Constantine Sidamon-Eristoff, administrator of Region 2 of the Federal Environmental Protection Agency, an area that includes Westchester.  \\"Since 1960, the waste stream has been growing faster than the population.\\"   Nationally, he said, \\"we're generating 160 million tons of garbage a year and nearly a third of the country's 6,500 landfills are expected to close within two years.\\"    So any effective strategy for managing waste, he concluded, must rely heavily on reducing waste and recycling it.    S. J. Schulman, president of the Westchester County Association, a business group, urged companies to take the lead in recycling efforts and suggested why: \\"One-third of the waste in Westchester is generated by business. If recycling fails, it means that more money will have to be spent on building a capital facility to handle it\\" like another garbage-to-energy incinerator. Handling Government Paper     The county built the incinerator in Peekskill that now handles much of the 371,00 tons of waste generated in Westchester a year. But it does not now have the money for a similar effort, said County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke. \\"The 1991 budget is edged in black,\\" he said. \\"We have to conserve what we have. Therefore, getting business involved in recycling becomes doubly important.\\"   The county became committed to recycling two years ago, Mr. O'Rourke said. \\"Nothing produces paper like government and that is why legislation requiring government to use recycled paper is especially important,\\" he said. \\"It helps create a market for recycled products.\\"   Every month, 682 tons of paper from 185 companies in the New York City region are being recovered, according to the State Legislative Commission on Solid Waste. The efforts of businesses and government in Westchester set a good example for the country, said Joanna D. Underwood, president and founder of Inform.   \\"Recycling is a basic way of making businesses more efficient,\\" Ms. Underwood said. \\"It is a process that doesn't call for any new technology. Only simple mundane steps are required, such as collecting waste and finding buyers and carters for materials.\\"   One Westchester example cited at the conference was the Reader's Digest in Chappaqua, which has announced that it saved $100,000 a year in disposal costs because of its waste program.   \\"New industries, which use recycled materials to make their products, are then created,\\" said Ms. Underwood, who added that the recycling of waste products is itself now an industry, and one that has provided jobs for semi-skilled people and handicapped workers. Waste Law Going into Effect     But aside from any potential economic incentives, waste management will become the law of the land, said Janet L. Matthews, legislative director of the New York State Legislative Commission on Solid Waste.   \\"Waste reduction is a priority of New York State,\\" she said. \\"By 1992, separation of waste materials\\" -- plastics, glass, cardboard and paper -- \\"is mandated. Our goal is to increase recyclable materials by 40 percent and reduce waste by 10 percent.\\"   State grants and loans are available for recycling programs, Ms. Matthews said, adding that the state is depending on the private sector to use secondary materials and recover materials from waste.   National goals, Mr. Sidamon-Eristoff of the E.P.A. said, call for a 25 percent reduction in the waste stream by 1992. This would be achieved by reduction and recycling, reversing the trend of increased waste production","excerpt":"by improving solid-waste management practices and by the development of needed landfills, municipal waste combusters and secondary markets to handle waste.    The conference's host, Ciba-Geigy, takes an \\"aggressive approach\\" to reducing the production of waste at its manufacturing plants, research laboratories and office buildings, said Richard Barth, Ciba-Geigy's president and chief operating officer.   \\"So far this year in the county, we have averaged 10 tons of recyclable materials a month,\\" he said, \\"helped by the active participation of our employees, who have made recycling a natural part of their daily routine.\\"  Employee Understanding Is a Key     Thomas Bianchi, manager of engineering and maintenance, shared some nuts and bolts details of the Ciba-Geigy program with the seminar participants. What's needed, he said, is manpower, space, a budget and knowledge of the recycled materials market.   Mr. Bianchi said his company had carved out space for recycling stations throughout its 60-acre site here. \\"They're used mostly for paper and glassware collected from labs,\\" he said. \\"For the first eight months of the year, we've collected 80 tons of paper, which is the equivalent of 400 trees, or 200 barrels of oil, which would heat 20 houses in New York State for a year.\\"   Up-front costs include the labor of the 13 people needed for the recycling program. \\"We've realized $1,200, paid to us for recycled items,\\" Mr. Bianchi said. \\"But the real results are down the road in the form of a sharp drop in disposal costs.\\"   <> <> But the sharp drop in disposal costs is linked to finding markets for the recycled material, and that can be a problem, said James J. Hogan, director of resource management for the County Department of Public Works.   \\"What recycling actually means is selling recycled material to 'end users' who will make something of it,\\" Mr. Hogan said. \\"But the problem is, the end user isn't always sure of a reliable supply of material. A mandatory recycling program is needed to insure the end user that he'll have his materials.\\"   The county, Mr. Hogan said, is stimulating the markets for recycled materials by buying recycled products and by helping end users, like a company that is processing mixed plastic materials. \\"We're helping them find a site for their plant,\\" he said.   The County Recycling Office has set up a hot line -- 285-2588 -- for businesses seeking recycling information.    Carl LaCavalla, vice president of Suburban Carting in Mamaroneck, a commercial transporting company, said carters have become solid-waste consultants and have begun to form recycling companies because \\"it's adapt or die.\\"   \\"But recycling will cost business money,\\" Mr. LaCavalla said, because the marketing structure \\"is not there.\\"    Most wastepaper, which is the largest recycled item, is going overseas to Pacific Rim countries, he said. \\"The only way it can get used up here is to create a market. Wastepaper used to bring $40 a ton; now we have to pay $40 a ton to get rid of it.\\"    He criticized the county, saying it had no good solid-waste management program in place. \\"We know garbage,\\" he said. \\"We know small and large businesses must be part of the waste-management plan. Right now, it's a gloomy picture.\\"    But to help them become part of the solution, the conference's participants each received a Business Recycling Manual. The manual, commissioned by the Westchester County Association, prepared by Inform and produced by Recourse Systems of Cambridge, Mass, delves into such topics as designing waste-management programs, teaching employees, negotiating with carters and dealing with special materials.

Even Nikon, long a leader in the 35mm field, has recently introduced a full line of lenses designed especially for the 4x5 camera. Deardorf, a Chicago based manufacturer that for over half a century has been making fine view cameras (which sell for over $1,000 today), has back-orders from anxious customers who have to wait six to eight months for delivery.   Those who use only a 35mm camera may wonder why so many photographers are turning to a difficult-to-use large-size camera that requires the use of a substantial tripod, bulky film holders, a changing bag, focusing cloth, separate hand-held exposure meter, and enough accessories to fill a good-sized camera case.   There is one good reason for this resurgence of interest - besides the fact that working with a 4x5 view camera is an exciting experience for the amateur, and a necessity for the professional. The reason is that with a view camera the photographer can exercise complete control of the picture before it is taken. The front and rear standards of a typical view camera can be raised, lowered, tilted, shifted, and swung in almost any direction. These different actions, together or separately, enable the photographer to increase or decrease depth of focus, or modify perspective and composition without changing the position of the camera.

Many gardeners confuse tree peonies with the herbaceous kind which die back to the ground in fall. Unlike herbaceous peonies, tree peonies develop woody stems, rough bark and a shrubby growth habit.

Spence, at 61, is a retired terrorist. He is the father figure -- if that's the right term -- of modern-day loyalist violence in Northern Ireland. In 1966 he founded the Ulster Volunteer Force, a murderous gang that took its name from a private army of unionists that sprang up just before World War I to provoke a civil war rather than break from Britain. Later that year, after he had killed a young Catholic barman, Spence was sentenced to life in Long Kesh prison. Somewhere along the way he repented, turned his back on violence and, after 18 years, was released. To the extremists he's still a revered figure.   Watching him on television, I was impressed by the way Spence read out the cease-fire statement. His voice seemed to tremble as he offered \\"abject and true remorse\\" to \\"the loved ones of all innocent victims over the past 25 years.\\" So I went to look him up. I found him in West Belfast inside the Shankill Historical Society, a fortresslike building with several locked doors of reinforced steel and, like many homes and offices in the city, an external camera to beam the image of callers onto a snowy black-and-white monitor deep inside a windowless control room.

Poisoning, on the other hand, is more controlled than shooting, but it has its drawbacks under our present close living conditions. The number of animals that roam about under such conditions are not all bad. Think of the number of cats and dogs that live within your own neighborhood. What are the alternatives? To select the most, feasible method, consider some of the animals that often visit the home property and explore some of their habits.&#8217","excerpt":"By knowing something about the animal and its habits, one can focus on these and often devise an effective method to discourage its presence.Moles:.At this time of year, one of the little pests that may have visited you during the past few months without too much notice may have been the mole which is first noticed in the spring often while looking over the condition of the lawn. Ridges and valleys throughout the lawn indicate this little fellow is or was present. Moles are insect &#8212; eating mammals and are highly specialized for living beneath the soil so you are not likely to see them above ground. They live almost continually in a. highly organized Systent of tunnels. Moles prodtice only a single litter of young in late April or early May When: their tunnels are made just under the surface, you can: see the ridges clearly. This up rooting of the grass or other plants in the area is what causes plant damage. The mole itself does not feed on plant materials. The mole's damage is caused by tunneling in search of insects and worms, within the soil environment. Since they live underground, moles are difficult to control. Special traps have been designed to enable one to trap them within their tunnels. They are available at most hardware stores. If you choose traps, you must determine where the active tunnels are, as many are only temporary. To find active tunnels, walk across the ridges to push them down. Then keep an eye on them to see if they are repaired. If they are, the tunnels are active and a trap should be placed there. Another method to eliminate moles is to control the bisects that formulate their food supply. Grubs are one of their favorites. These are easily controlled by the use of insecticides such as chlordane or milky spore disease which is specific for Japanese beetle grubs. When the food source is no longer available, the moles will venture elsewhere. Friends Or Foes?"},{"year":"1969","title":"Abe, Kobo: The Ruined Map The Ruined Map","excerpt":"By Kobo Abe.

Painters and writers, philosophers and theologians went there to live and took with them taste, culture and a love of art. They created a climate that continues to this day, fostered by the many private collectors and by the sponsorship of bankers and leaders of industry, but not by these alone.   Within a block of each other in the heart of this self-assured city are the Kunstmuseum and the Kunsthalle. The first houses the oldest public art collection in the world and has more works by Hans Holbein the Younger -15 paintings and many drawings - than any other museum. The second, which is more of a gallery, is the home of changing contemporary exhibitions and also of the Kunsthalle Restaurant, whose clientele includes many of the well-to-do who own and endow the art collections of the city.   The Kunstmuseum, in which most of the development of painting and drawing in the Upper Rhine region from 1400 to 1600 is represented, captures the sweep of art history from Lucas Cranach the Elder to Franz Kline, yet its riches are not exhausting.

The next year, however, Miss Nilsson stopped coming to this country because of problems with the Internal Revenue Service, returning triumphantly only last year. Now, the opera company is delighted to report, she is indeed returning to it for a benefit concert in Newark on Nov. 7.   Miss Nilsson, acknowledged by critics to be ''by any measure, the greatest Wagnerian soprano of our time,'' is pulling out all the stops. She will sing some of the most glorious selections in her Wagnerian repertory - the Immolation Scene from ''Gotterdammerung,'' the ''Liebestod'' from ''Tristan und Isolde,'' ''Dich, teure Hall'' from ''Tannhauser'' and ''Es gibt ein Reich'' from Richard Strauss's ''Ariadne auf Naxos.''

Virtuosity is what you need to get into the game, and a very tough game it is.

The most popular is FunWall, which is like an electronic wall where your friends can put up videos, photos and rude comments. FunWall has about 3.5 million active users and was designed by Slide, a small California company that has seized the widget moment. Many Facebook applications, though, are created by individuals or groups of two or three people. RateBeer, designed by Jonathan Kelly (about to graduate from California Polytechnic next year), has acquired from Facebook members more than 400,000 ratings of 19,000 beers.

It bears the title of \\"Forty Winks,\\" having been translated to the screen from \\"Lord Chumley,\\" a play by David Belasco and Henry C. De Mille. It is a thoroughly hilarious effort, produced with considerable skill by Paul Irfbe and Frank Urson. Frequently there are satiric touches, which only make the production all the funnier.Not only is the direction sparkling and original, but the subtitles suit the picture and enhance its humor. Raymond Griffith, who has been seen in numerous productions, has abandoned his juggling with knives and forks and seems to have found himself as Lord Chumley, an English nobleman who is not quite as foolish as he appears. In one of the early stages of this picture he is seen trying a high jump on horseback. He fails the first time, but Eleanor Butterworth (Viola Dana) has great, confidence to the nobleman's persistence, and she wagers with her old father, a retired Admiral, that Chumley will make the jump on his second attempt. Chumley does, but he bad not calculated on his horse sitting down near the water-lily pool, and soon he finds himself tossed into the water. Not in the least discouraged by his sudden immersion, he recovers himself instanter and offers a water-lily to Eleanor.One of the amusing moments, in this farce is where Eleanor and Chumley have taken refuge on a naval target. Chumley has had a terrific struggle with the villain, Gaspar Le Sage (Cyril Chadwick), and when the nobleman and the girl realize their predicament as shells are fired at the target, Le Sage passes in his motor launch. Chumley here shouts:\\"Good old Le Sage, here we are Le Sage!\\"But the villain pursues his own wicked way, leaving the two to meet their doom. The shooting from the battleships is more and more accurate, first blowing away the left wing of the target, then the right wing and finally the centre. By some freak of fortune, Chumley and Eleanor are untouched, and the former espies a small boat. They get into this craft and endeavor to row away, but it gradually fills with water, until Chumley, always in a morning suit and silk hat, puts the envelope, containing the navay coast defense secrets, into his hat believing that everything is over. Just at that instant up comes a submarine on which is marked \\"Deutschland über Alles!\\" Out pops a man resembling von Tirpitz, whose first question is: \\"Is the war over?\\" He is overjoyed to learn that it is. and forthwith rescues Chumley and the heroine. The silk hat with the naval secrets is seen bobbing on the surface, but after a few seconds up comes Chumley's hand and pulls it into the submarine.Anna May Wong is splendid as the vampire working for Le Sage. She has specially doped cigarettes, which she gives to Lieutenant Butterworth, so as to get posession of his keys. Then follows suspicion, activity, a decidedly clever dog's performance, a burglar working in the house without knowing that he is being watched and actually aided in finding his tools.Miss Dana is charming as the heroine and Mr. Chadwick, who officiated as Spoofy in the stage version of \\"Three Live Ghosts,\\" and who was recently seen as Mr. Darling in the screen version of \\"Peter Pan, gives a convincing performance as a melodramatic villain.This is one of the most brilliant farces that has ever been picturized.\\"The Last Laugh,\\" the German production, which we have already reviewed, is also on the Rialto program. Plenty or laughter was furnished by an Ives-Leventhal stereoscopic production, \\"Ouch!\\" at which the audience looked through colored glasses. It is an excellent program, such as one seldom sees in a motion picture theatre. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"By MORDAUNT HALL."},{"year":"1927","title":"The scenery of \\"Peaks of Destiny,\\" a melodrama set against the Alpine snows, is so inspiring that it easily takes precedence over the narrative. Curiously, it is this realism or truth of the sparkling background, coupled with discerning directorial ideas, that serves to emphasize the artificiality of the main incident of the tale. Dr. Arnold Fanck, the director who made this subject for Ufa, is therefore to be congratulated on his photographic feats, but it does seem strange that an obviously imaginative producer should have been so blind to the forced nature of his story.Aside from this strained dramatic situation, there is also a good deal of shrieking and shouting without going anywhere. These actions probably go hand in hand with this type of yarn, and one gleans that when a character talks too long before going forth on a rescue it is done to create suspense. Actually, it is not a little exasperating, especially in a film that possesses so many good points.Even in the early scenes it is apparent that the story is to be subordinated to the camera studies—glimpses of clouds, silhouetted figures, vast stretches of smooth snows and flashes of the sea.The mountains have a fascination for Diotina, a danger, who enjoys the rarified air more than that of the city. At the same time she rather likes a little flirtation, and in this instance her weakness nearly leads to a tragedy.Carl, a valiant ski expert, is madly in love with Diotina and his affection is requited. Subsequently, Vigo, a youth, becomes enamored of the dancer and Carl is wild with jealousy. While on a jaunt in the mountains he decides to end his young rival's life by pushing Vigo over a precipice. He succeeds in enticing Vigo to accompany him and when a lofty point is reached Carl thrusts the youth over the edge, apparently forgetting that he and Vigo are roped together. The older man regrets his action the instant he sees Vigo fall, and there ensues the struggle of Vigo to climb back to the ledge, while Carl tugs on the rope to help him.Dr. Fanck shows the men's faces becoming red with the cold. A storm comes up and Vigo is seen hanging limp while Carl is standing stiff, still able to save the younger man from falling. Judging by the time this takes to tell and the various complications that lead up to the rescue, it seems amazing that Carl could have remained in his standing position for anything like the time one imagines he does.There are some remarkably fine skiing episodes. A contest in this sport with watching throngs is depicted. All these stretches are filmed with much artistry and during the storm the characters really appear to be suffering from the cold.Leni Riefenstahl, who impersonates the dancer, is an actress with no little charm. Her overacting is to be blamed on Dr. Fanck. Louis Trenker and Ernst Peterson give intelligent performances.

But so far, Donnie Sellers says, that has not happened to him. If it did, though, it would be understandable.   That's because Mr. Sellers is living a dual life, working full time as a police officer in Norwalk, as he has for the last 26 years, and serving in the General Assembly in Hartford. In addition, he is serving his second term on the Norwalk Common Council, is in his sixth year as a member of the city's Fair Rent Commission and is in the Army Reserve.   That all leaves Mr. Sellers, 48, with little time for sleep. \\"Fortunately I'm able to get by with very little sleep,\\" he said in an interview at Norwalk police headquarters. \\"I'm also fortunate in that I have a tremendous amount of energy.\\"   Mr. Sellers is one of two police officers in the General Assembly. The other, Edwin Garcia, a sergeant in the Hartford Police Deparment, is also a freshman State Representative and, like Mr. Sellers, has to work an all-night shift in order to serve in the legislature.   But, as Mr. Garcia pointed out, \\"When I'm at the State Capitol, I'm only five minutes from home and five minutes from work.\\" By contrast, Mr. Sellers lives 65 miles from the Capitol and the trip, made almost daily, takes him about an hour and 15 minutes.   Only one other police officer has served in the General Assembly, Joseph Raia of New Britain. A Democrat, as are Mr. Sellers and Mr. Garcia, Mr. Raia served three terms before he was defeated in a primary in his city last May.   Indeed, Mr. Raia let his State Senator know that he supported a bill to permit police officers and other municipal officials to run for office. \\"I had wanted to run for the legislature for some time, since I felt that police officers in the state were being treated by the legislature as second-class citizens,\\" Mr. Raia said. \\"But I couldn't because municipal workers were prohibited from running in Connecticut. So I told State Senator Joe Harper of New Britain that I was all for the bill.\\"   The bill passed in October 1984. And two years later, Mr. Raia, who has been a police officer for 23 years, was elected to the General Assembly.  But unlike Mr. Sellers and Mr. Garcia, Mr. Raia took off days without pay when he had to be at the State Capitol. \\"It cost me about $10,000 a year, plus about $6,000 in overtime,\\" he said. That adds up to $16,000, which is what state legislators are paid, so Mr. Raia, in effect, broke even.   Before running for a vacant seat in the General Assembly in a special election last January, Mr. Sellers sought the advice of Mr. Raia and Mr. Garcia as to the feasibility of being a combination police officer and State Representative. \\"They both encouraged me,\\" he said with a smile. \\"But then they don't live 65 miles from Hartford.\\"  A Typical Day    On a typical day, Mr. Sellers, who is divorced and the father of three sons, works from 11 P.M. to 7 A.M. in the complaint bureau of the Norwalk Police Department, then goes home to get a few hours sleep before driving to Hartford. There, he spends up to eight hours attending legislative sessions, public hearings or meetings of the House Education and Labor and Employees Committees of which he is a member. Then Mr. Sellers drives home, catches a few more hours of sleep and is back at his desk in uniform at 11 P.M. \\"Fortunately, I often have my days off during the week, which makes it easier for me in Hartford,\\" said Mr. Sellers, who won his seat in the special election by a 2-to-1 margin while running with the endorsements of the Democratic Party and A Connecticut Party. \\"When I do and I'm tied up late, I often stay over in Hartford with friends.\\"   But on other days, neither snow, nor rain nor lack of sleep keeps Mr. Sellers from making his rounds as a state legislator and police officer. For instance, during the March 12 blizzard, Mr. Sellers, rather than drive, took a bus from Norwalk to Hartford because of the storm forecast. Then at the end of his legislative day, he hitched a ride with another Fairfield County legislator in order to get back home in time for the start of his 11 P.M. shift. \\"It was kind of a rough day,\\" he recalled. \\"But everything worked out all right.\\" Not to Mention Other Commitments    Still, at times Mr. Sellers has found himself wondering just what in the world he is doing, serving two masters, the legislature and the police department, not to mention his other municipal commitments and the Army Reserves (with whom he spent a recent weekend at Camp Smith, N.Y., near Peekskill).   \\"There've been some doubts from time to time, but I'm sure it's going to work out just fine,\\" said Mr. Sellers, who has walked a beat, ridden in a radio car and served as a community relations officer since joining the Norwalk Police Department in 1966. \\"But I don't think I'm going to seek a third term in the Council this fall and I'll probably resign from the Fair Rent Commission.\\"   No one will hold that against Mr. Sellers, whose councilmanic district includes a black and Hispanic section of South Norwalk where he still lives. That is primarily because of Mr. Sellers's popularity and visibility. Over the years, he has made it a point to come to know just about everyone in his neighborhood and, it seems, thousands of other people in Norwalk. Now he is determined to become acquainted with more people in the 140th legislative district, which includes most of South Norwalk but extends as far north as the Merritt Parkway. Directing Traffic With Flair    Given his style, that should not be too difficult. Few, if any, public figures in Norwalk are as recognizable as Mr. Sellers who has a penchant for flamboyant behavior, whether directing traffic or strolling the streets.   The question arises as to how Mr. Sellers got to know so many people in Norwalk. \\"It's because I've been a people's kind of cop, and I've always made it a point to reach out,\\" he said. \\"And I go out of my way to get to know people. I even have my phone number listed, and I always have. Not many cops do.\\"   Mr. Sellers's entry into politics came about indirectly. \\"I was talking with Nick DePalma, who was then running for mayor as an independent and campaigning in South Norwalk in 1983,\\" Mr. Sellers recalled. \\"After a while, he said to me, 'Have you ever considered getting into politics?' I told him no, and he said, 'Do you realize people have been honking their horns at you nonstop since we started to talk?' It hadn't even dawned on me.\\"   Later that year, Mr. Sellers received the Independent Party's nomination for the Common Council in his district. But no one had bothered to check the Police Department's manual, which then prohibited officers from seeking public office.   \\"So I went to Mayor Frank Esposito and asked him if he would please appoint me to some board because I wanted to serve the people,\\" Mr. Sellers said. Subsequently, Mr. Esposito appointed Mr. Sellers to the Fair Rent Commission. \\"I called the local newspaper about it and had them take my picture and put it in the paper,\\" Mr. Sellers said unabashedly. \\"I wanted people to know that I was on the commission.\\" Critics Take Attendance    In 1989, after the legislature changed the law, Mr. Sellers became the first police officer ever elected to the Norwalk Common Council when, running on the Democratic ticket, he won in a three-way race. \\"When I was approached to run, I asked myself, 'Donnie, do you have a future in politics?' And I realized I was a very powerful black candidate. So I thought, go for the gusto. Nothing ventured, nothing gained, and opportunity knocks only once.\\"   Mr. Sellers was re-elected to the Common Council in 1991. But since taking his Council seat, he has been criticized, mainly by Republicans, for missing too many committee meetings. Mr. Sellers does not deny that, saying it has been because of other priorities, including his three sons. \\"Missing committee meetings hasn't affected my work as a councilman, and I never miss the actual Council meetings,\\" he said.   Holding down two jobs is hardly new for Mr. Sellers, who is a graduate of the University of New Haven with a degree in political science. For six years he spent five hours a day teaching troubled middle and high school students in a special program at the Benjamin Franklin School in Norwalk. And during three of those years he also directed traffic outside of Pitney Bowes on Main Avenue in Norwalk from 3 to 6 P.M. five days a week. In addition, Mr. Sellers had started a boxing club for teen-agers and established a youth organization for young people from middle-class neighborhoods.   \\"Norwalk's been good to me, and I want to give something back,\\" Mr. Sellers said. \\"And I think I understand people because I'm a grass-roots type of person. For instance, people in my Council district aren't issue-oriented. But they're petrified because of all of the crime. When they vote, they vote for me, Donnie Sellers, not the issues.\\" 'My Own Mother Was Mugged'    Occasionally Mr. Sellers patrols his neighborhood in his car or on foot on his own time, in and out of uniform. It is a low-income area, riddled by drug-trafficking and crime, much of it violent. \\"My own mother was mugged in my driveway at 5:30 in the morning as she was walking toward her car to go to work,\\" Mr. Sellers said. But he remains upbeat, waving and calling out to residents. \\"It's bad, but I do my best to try to make things better.\\"   Even one of Mr. Sellers's sons has been scarred by illicit drugs. His son Earl, who is 21, has been arrested several times on drug charges and was shot and wounded in an apparent drug dispute in Stamford last September. He has spent time in prison and at several drug rehabilitation units.   \\"I even locked Earl up myself,\\" Mr. Sellers said. \\"Once, he even stole my gun and sold it to get money for drugs. My reaction to all of that? To get him help. It's a disease. I love Earl, and we have a good relationship.\\"   Mr. Sellers recalled how stories about him and Earl appeared in the same edition of the local newspaper in February. \\"My victory in the special election was on page one,\\" he recalled. \\"And on page 3 there was a story about Earl being arrested. It shows that these things can happen to anybody.\\" By Day, It's Representative Sellers","excerpt":"By Night, Officer Sellers."},{"year":"2018","title":"By day, she searches for her estranged father","excerpt":"by night, she experiments with anonymous encounters in this character study by Amber Sealey.

This volume reprints David Leavitt's three short-story collections, ''Family Dancing'' (1984), ''A Place I've Never Been'' (1990) and ''The Marble Quilt'' (2001) -- the last one for the first time in paperback. Leavitt's subject, Wendy Martin wrote in her review in these pages of ''A Place I've Never Been,'' is ''the complexities of love -- platonic, erotic and electronic,'' and his prose ''is often spare and carefully honed.'' Michael Pye found that some of the stories in ''The Marble Quilt'' do not ''feel rooted in a solidly imagined world,'' but noted that others are a reminder of how good Leavitt -- whom he called ''an elegant and sexy and clever writer'' -- can be.    IT MUST'VE BEEN SOMETHING I ATE: The Return of the Man Who Ate Everything, by Jeffrey Steingarten. (Vintage, $15.) In this collection of essays from his food column in Vogue, Steingarten witnesses a pig slaughter in southwest France and lugs sacks of flour home from Italy so that he can reproduce a Rome restaurant's pizza bianca. He is ''an urbane, endlessly inquisitive, omnivorous globetrotter,'' Corby Kummer said here earlier this year, ''and you're likely to be glad you can go along for the ride.''    I WANT THAT! How We All Became Shoppers, by Thomas Hine. (Perennial/HarperCollins, $13.95.) This cultural history roams across 4,000 years and several continents in search of what makes people flock to markets, bazaars and malls. At the root of all shopping, Hine finds a stew of motives, including insecurity, power and responsibility. He ''loves all the bedazzlements of the marketplace,'' Laura Shapiro wrote in the Book Review in 2002. ''The book's copious themes and fragmentary ideas piled up helter-skelter constitute the store,'' and ''the reader is the shopper.''    THE SHAMAN'S COAT: A Native History of Siberia, by Anna Reid. (Walker, $13.) When Russia unexpectedly conquered Siberia in the 16th century, it acted like other colonial powers, making the wilderness its own and ''civilizing'' the savages who lived there","excerpt":"by now their culture has been nearly obliterated. Anna Reid's account of her Siberian journey is ''part history, part travelogue, part excursion through the outback of Siberian lore,'' Benson Bobrick said in these pages last year. Aided by ''acute curiosity, fine descriptive gifts and delight in detail,'' she explores the fate of the land and its people.    THE YEAR OF ICE, by Brian Malloy. (St. Martin's Griffin, $12.95.) Kevin Doyle is handsome and popular with his friends at a Minneapolis high school in 1978. He wants people to think he's cool and hopes they won't guess his secret -- he likes boys. In the course of this novel, Kevin struggles with his mother's death and his father's remarriage and begins to come of age sexually. ''It is a tribute to Malloy's skill that he can hand us a narrator who is a vain, shallow . . . bully and make him sympathetic,'' our reviewer, Suzanne Berne, wrote in 2002.    WINTERING: A Novel of Sylvia Plath, by Kate Moses. (Anchor, $13.) This novel about ambition, motherhood, identity and love fictionalizes the last months of Sylvia Plath's life, following the end of her marriage to Ted Hughes and leading up to her suicide at the age of 30 in 1963. ''The narrative voice is a distillation of Plath's diaries, letters and poems,'' Kate Bolick said in the Book Review earlier this year, and Moses writes ''with lyrical dexterity and great economy.''    PUBLIC INTELLECTUALS: A Study of Decline, by Richard A. Posner. (Harvard University, $19.95.) Judge Posner compiles a list of the 100 American public intellectuals with the most media mentions (Henry Kissinger is No. 1) and attempts to apply economic laws to public debate. ''Every public intellectual who comes into his sights is found wanting,'' David Brooks remarked in these pages in 2002. But Posner ''deserves attention no matter how infuriating he can be.''    DEAR MR. PRESIDENT, by Gabe Hudson. (Vintage Contemporaries, $11.) The seven short stories and one novella in this first book are all related to the Persian Gulf war, but it's nothing like the CNN version. Chris Colin praised this ''inventive collection'' in the Book Review last year, and found ''something admirable about a writer who confronts the preposterousness of war with some preposterousness all his own.''

Now he has turned his lens on the south, producing a dramatic series of images of the haute monde of Naples. An extensive selection of these works makes up a fascinating show at the Barbara Gladstone Gallery, which reveals the continuing development of Mr. Faigenbaum's vision. Far from providing a flattering image of the sitters, the photographs are drenched with the deliciously ominous air of a gothic novel. The people in them look as if they've stepped out of a story by Alberto Moravia, or, in some cases, a Charles Addams cartoon. At the same time, they offer a thought-provoking reworking of the familiar genre of the portrait.   Every portrait takes its place on a spectrum between the social and the personal. By focusing on the face, the portraitist emphasizes the individual characteristics of the sitter","excerpt":"by pulling the easel or camera back, he or she focuses on the surroundings. Mr. Faigenbaum's photographs are close in spirit to the work of August Sander, who in the 1920's and 30's attempted to form a pictorial catalogue of German society by photographing people not for themselves, but as representative of social types.

An earlier vaccine against rotavirus, made by Wyeth, was pulled from the American market in 1999 for safety reasons.

That is completely wrong.    The recommendations were completed in August, not in May.

In that telephone call, the editors explicitly affirmed the journal's longstanding policy that disseminating news about important AIDS research would not jeopardize publication in the journal -- a policy that the N.I.H. is familiar with and has acted on in the past.   The journal scheduled publication of the recommendations and two of the research papers on which they were based within two weeks, as soon as the last of the papers had been revised. There is a production lag of eight weeks; hence the publication date of Nov. 22. In the meantime, the N.I.H. prepared its alert to doctors and released it Oct. 10.    The information on corticosteroids as adjunctive therapy in pneumocystis carinii pneumonia was also disseminated from June 1990.    The data were presented at the International AIDS Conference in San Francisco on June 23, in articles in The Los Angeles Times and The San Diego Union on June 24, in a scientific paper and an editorial of the Annals of Internal Medicine on July 1, in six broadcasts by Lifetime Medical Television in July, August and September, and in a formal presentation at the AIDS clinical trials group meeting of the allergy institute in Bethesda, Md., on July 13, which was open to investigators, activists and the press.
