Shaw was a music critic before he established his fame as a dramatist, and some think he was the most brilliant of them all","excerpt":"certainly he was the most stylishly dazzling.    Like all the best critics, Shaw was no mere reporter, humbly content to chronicle musical events. He had a polemical position he espoused with a fierce passion - that of modernist Wagernianism, the progressive musical current of his day. But he didn't just espouse the positive; he excoriated the negative, too, as a tireless, Anglophobic mocker of late-Victorian pomposity and pretension. On both counts, Brahms's German Requiem aroused his ire; indeed, it is unlikely that any one piece has occasioned more snideness by any one critic than that Shaw heaped upon Brahms's poor requiem.

In Mozart's day, of course, it wasn't all that usual to listen to music three decades old, let alone three centuries - but even then things were starting to change. Music was beginning to mean something beyond its immediate function; composers were beginning (perhaps not yet consciously) to write for the ages.   And in some ways music was getting into trouble. Glorious trouble, trouble through which several generations of heroic composers fought to win an audience for their ever richer, ever more complex, ever more idiosyncratic and personal musical visions. But though individual geniuses have won their individual battles, on the whole the composers have lost. Up to Mozart's time and for a good while after, the public clamored for novelty above all. Today his heirs can hardly be said to have a public, and the mainstream audience clamors for - well, mostly Mozart.

Too often, the spectacle of well-fed, sparklingly toothy actors trying to depict the inhumanity of Nazi Germany's death camps is so absurd as to be almost obscene. On screen, the terrible story seems to be best captured when the focus is limited to a single person or incident, one of the most outstanding examples being \\"The Diary of Anne Frank.\\" It's as if the enormity of the crime can only be fully grasped through mundane details.    At first glance, \\"Never Forget\\" -- being shown tonight on the TNT cable channel at 8, 10, 12 and 2 A.M. -- is not a Holocaust film. The docudrama concerns a lawsuit, Mel Mermelstein v. Institute for Historical Review, et al., that was decided in court in 1981, 36 years after the end of World War II. But the Holocaust, and how it will be remembered, is at the very core of this story. Mr. Mermelstein, an Auschwitz-Birkenau survivor living comfortably with his wife and four children in California, not only lectured to school groups about the Nazi experience but also constructed his own exhibit with period photographs and collages of clothing and artifacts from the camps.

He has inspired the Fauves, the Cubists, the German Expressionists, the Russian Constructivists and Suprematists, the Surrealists and virtually every serious painter since. Each has found in him something different to admire, whether it is the blackness and tortured eroticism of his early works or the stupendous internal logic of the late landscapes and still lifes. His art has been pored over, and even collected, by one generation of artists after the next.         So how is it that he remains such a mystery? The strongest impression you can take away from the great Cezanne exhibition that just opened at the Philadelphia Museum of Art is how inscrutable, actually downright strange, his work is. There's hardly a picture he painted that doesn't have some weird riddle in it, some animating eruption of space or amputation of a figure's limbs. You get the  contradictory sense of a hard-won, implacable orderliness combined with a latent chaos that makes Cezanne's art unnerving and gripping.

Adler Paedia Proposal, that Great Books about great ideas and deeds should be introduced in the elementary grades (Adler, 1985)","excerpt":"cf. Allan Bloom's \\"The Closing of the American Mind\\"--\\"Book learning is most of what a teacher can give.\\" (Bloom, 1987). This is the if-you-build-the-schoolhouse-the-pupils-will-come-and-worship-gods-of-learning school of education.*  2. Calvin may be an example Howard Gardener refers to as Multiple Intelligences (Gardner, 1993). though Gardener refuses to admit it. Here Calvin clearly exhibits strengths in linguistic, scientific and outerspatial intelligence.**  3. You can see from Calvin's obvious level of emotional and intellectual commitment to comic books that reading them puts him in a state of what Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi defines as flow: \\"When challeges are high and personal skills are used to the utmost, we experience that rare state of consciousness . . . . We feel involved, concentrated, absorbed.\\" (Csikszentmihalyi, 1993).***  4. Miss Wormwood is a devoted disciplinary disciple of either William or Jesse James. **** Her oppoents argue displeased with Calvin's ahistoricity. However, Calvin could counter that many famous and successful people had little regard for history, viz. Henry Ford, \\"History is more or less bunk\\", and cf. Ronald Reagan, \\"Facts are stupid things\\" et passim.    5. Miss Wormwood takes the neoconservative approach along with Adler, Bloom, E.D. Hirtsch and William Bennett, who hunger for a capacious store of common knowledge and skills.*****    6. Gardner is insistent that Calvin's strong domains of intelligence not be labeled \\"dumb\\" and \\"useless\\" by an uncaring educational system that has only \\"impatience with approaches that cherish the individuality of each student.\\" (ibid) Bloom, however, knows Calvin is dumb and useless. Sociologist Paul Fussell adds that what Calvin knows is not only dumb and useless but bad. (Fussell, 1991).  7. Fussell reports there are 60 million functionally illiterate adults in the United States, with another 60 million reading at a fifth grade level. Only 6 percent of the population report having read at least one book in the last year. (ibid)  8. Calvin did read at least one bona fide book last year, in addition to \\"Captain Thermonuclear etc.\\" It was Robert Fulghum's \\"Everything I Needed to Know I Learned in Kindergarten.\\" At least he started it.+   9. Calvin can only agree with Gardner that \\"a significant part of our educational malaise lay in the mindless instruments that were conventionally used to assess student learning\\" (Gardner, op cit) and with John Dewey that \\"In contrast to the 'testing society' I think that the assessment approach and the individual-centered school constitute a more noble educational vision. Both are more inkeeping with American democratic and pluralistic values (Dewey, 1938). \\"Relativism!\\" scoffs Bloom. BAD, says Fussell.  *Hah! Wrong! Even if you build it, they will still sit around reading comic books. (Hobbes)  ** Note: there is no entry for \\"Captain Napalm's Thermonuclear League of Liberty\\" in E.D. Hirsch's \\"A First Dictionary of Cultural Literacy: What Our Children Need to Know\\" (Hirsch, 1989).  ***But what is the poor lad getting excited about? Trash like Captain Thermonuclear? Doesn't he know that in Hobbes' words, life is \\"mean, nasty, brutish and short\\"? (Hobbes, 19TK).+  ****This was still being debated when Education Life went to press.  7:  [  NO! NO! You journalists are all the same. What I actually told the Republican National Convention in 1988, quoting from John Addams, of course was this:   \\"Facts are stupid things, stubborn things, I should say.\\" -- Ronald Reagan. Incidentally, if you tip either this footnote symbol or your head on its side, you'll see it makes a very nice, small portrait of me.   *****That capacious-store business is actually a clever bit of plagarism on Nash's part but we heard somewhere that, if you confess that kind of thin it in a footnote to a footnote, you're all right. (Eds.)  + Actually, he didn't even start it. He read the cover and figured that was all he needed to know.

That is, until now. For today, to mark his 80th birthday, the Nassau County Museum of Fine Art opens ''Chaim Gross at 80: A Retrospective of His Sculptures in Wood.'' With works on loan from such institutions as the Museum of Modern Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden and private collections, the exhibition, according to Constance Schwartz, the museum curator, illustrates how ''those exuberant many-dimensional studies have become synonymous with this unique artist.'' The exhibition, she added, also includes working drawings and watercolors,\\n\\nRunning concurrently with ''Works by Max Beckmann,'' an overview of paintings by the celebrated German artist, the Gross exhibition can be seen from 10 A.M. to 4:30 P.M.
