B. Warner and Lois Wilson, the climax is by no means all one anticipates. It is another instance where the producers have closed their eyes to legal possibilities in order to gain their point, which is a highly improbable one.Both Miss Wilson and Mr. Warner handle their lines with marked ability. There is hesitancy where hesitancy should occur and in virtually all the passages there is a pleasing inflection of speech. It would seem that Mr. Warner has seen to it that his utterances are free from melodramatic phrases. This picture is, moreover, unusually well recorded, and yesterday afternoon the projection operator did his share to keep the tonal quality of the voices at a natural pitch.The narrative deals with the illegal borrowing of millions by directors of the Emerson Trust Company. These men in the initial scenes seem to take their troubles somewhat lightly, and the idea of their drawing cards to decide who shall bear the brunt of the peculations may be colorful, but in these days of swift penalty it is open to ridicule.Carvel Emerson feels that his father has been drawn unwittingly into the financial débâcle and he is therefore eager to save the old man, even if he has to pay the piper. Another angle to the story is that Carvel's former sweetheart has become the wife of James Darwin, a prosecutor attached to the Attorney General's office, a rôle played by Mr. Warner. Mrs. Darwin is filled with sympathy for young Emerson and quite resentful when she is asked by her husband not to associate with the banker's family.In an early scene Carvel Emerson, Tooker and other directors, after hearing of the fall of Stocks Exchange prices, wish to take their notes out of the venlt, but this is impossible, as the time-lock, so they believe, has been set for the next morning. Young Emerson, however, a little later finds George Cowper, a trusted clerk of the bank, in the vault. He receives from Cowper what purport to be the promissory notes, but subsequently Emerson discovers that the unfortunate Cowper is involved in the financial maelstrom and has turned State's evidence. After giving the real notes to Darwin, Cowper has forged the directors' signatures on those he handed to Emerson.Follows then a sequence in which Carvel Emerson, who has heard that Darwin has gone to Washington, enters the Darwin home to obtain the notes. In this he succeeds, but first he is seen by Mrs. Darwin and then by Darwin, who returns unexpectedly. Mrs. Darwin tries to pretend that nothing untoward has happened, but her husband eventually sees Emerson, and also discovers that the lock on his desk has been broken open.These episodes are depicted with good drama. The idea of a prosecuting attorney with aspirations to be Attorney General wilting under threats from his wife may be all very well, but it seems extremely far-fetched when Darwin, after having reported to Washington, informs the judge that he has insufficient evidence to warrant prosecuting the bank directors. And, to make matters still more impossible, the judge, without the slightest hesitation, dismisses the case.Besides the capital work of Mr. Warner and Miss Wilson, George Fawcett does, admirably as old man Emerson, Jason Robards gives a convincing portrayal of Carvel Emerson, and Johnny Arthur is believable as Cowper.

But even when the economy recovers, the scars in the banking industry will remain, and bankers are vowing not to return to their old habits.    From giant Citicorp to small savings banks, bankers are relearning the principles of safe lending -- sometimes to the dismay of real estate developers and others in business. But while banks tighten their lending standards to keep a rein on future loan losses, there are no miracle cures for the record amounts of bad loans already on their books. Since most bankers cannot afford the losses that would occur if they sold these loans, they must nurse them along. They can foreclose, carry borrowers under easier terms or offer new loans in hopes that more money will put some troubled developers over the hump.

Market Place","excerpt":"Banking: Bright Spot Stands Out In Quarter"},{"year":"1990","title":"With their profits and stature at a low ebb, New York's largest banks are realizing that their size and traditions do not guarantee them a place at the top of the financial-services indus try in 10 years.    The banking industry prob ably faces more questions about its future than perhaps any other important segment of the New York City economy. Banking provides more than 170,000 jobs in the city, up by more than 10,000 in a decade. Still, banking employment has fallen by about 15,000 in the last three years.   Costly mistakes on loans to less-developed countries and real estate developers have so weakened the largest banks that they now lack the financial muscle to expand into new markets and businesses.    Still, demand for bank products is growing at a healthy rate, which is one reason why nonbanking companies like the General Electric Company have moved into areas like corporate lending and credit cards.   For now, the city's largest banks -- with the exception of J. P. Morgan & Company and the Bankers Trust Company -- are so strapped by bad loans that they are concentrating on cutting costs. But in the coming decade, bankers and analysts expect a wave of mergers, acquisitions and joint ventures.  Millions of Dollars in Savings    The merger of any two big New York banks could raise their profits by hundreds of millions of dollars by eliminating duplicate branches, headquarters and executives.    Since Citibank, the nation's largest bank, has only about 15 percent of consumer accounts in the New York market, and Chemical, Manufacturers Hanover and Chase Manhattan, the next three, have a total share of only about 18 percent, some analysts see room for large-scale consolidation without any bank gaining monopoly power.    Thomas Labrecque, chairman of Chase Manhattan, said consolidiation need not be limited to banks. He noted that competitors like the mortgage unit of the General Motors Corporation often have lower costs. Chase would consider merging or creating joint ventures with such companies, he said.    Analysts are confident that a large banking industry will remain in New York City, but the organizations and even the names of banks are in question. The answers depend on whether banks are allowed and have the inclination to merge with each other or industrial companies, to develop nationwide branches, or to expand into securities and insurance.    New York City is likely to be headquarters for at least a few of the giant banks in the next generation, but many jobs will be elsewhere. A number of large banks already have credit-card operations in states like Delaware and South Dakota, where taxes and labor costs are lower.
