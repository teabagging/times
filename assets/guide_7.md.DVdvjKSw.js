In &#8216;Boesman and Lena&#8217; he is through suggesting: he is shouting from the roof. It is a strange, bitter, disturbing and, in a sense, beautiful play about human deprivation and human survival. Boesman and Lena are Cape Coloreds, neither white nor black, and fairly low down in South Africa's racial hierarchy. Mr. Fugard is constantly holding our attention with fresh insights into these two derelicts, making us care desperately, about them. John Berry's staging is wonderfully telling. Ruby Dee as Lena is giving one of the finest performances I have ever seen. Her eyes, her voice, her manner, her entire being have a quality of wholeness that is rarely encountered in the theater. James Earl Jones is almost as remarkable as Boesman. South African authorities have refused Mr. Fugard a passport to leave his native land.

Windows overlooking the airfield have been added, along with about 600 seats for waiting passengers and extra space for concessions and airline offices. The expansion will allow intermittent customs and immigration service to become a full-time operation this summer, primarily for charter flights from Canada.

The Portuguese arrived on the coast of what would become Brazil with the expedition of Pedro Alvares Cabral in 1500 and found an indigenous population of semisedentary and nonsedentary cultures. Many of the semisedentary Indians spoke the Tupian language and shared similar cultural features. The Tupians quickly formed economic relationships with the first Europeans, who were interested in the valuable dyewood that was so abundant in Brazil. The transition of Indian-European economic relations from barter to slavery was given momentum by the introduction of sugar export agriculture, a trend that began in the region in the 1540's. The 1560's saw epidemics of smallpox and measles in the coastal areas, which greatly reduced the indigenous population. Although the European sugar growers initially favored the use of indigenous peoples over imported African slave labor, the shortage of labor resulting from the epidemics led to increasing use of African slave labor by the Portuguese. The Portuguese vied with other European powers for control of Brazilian territory, and in 1630 the Dutch briefly seized the northeastern sugar-growing area. Brazil's southern regions were underpopulated during the early colonial period, and Portuguese activity was largely limited to cattle raising. With the discovery of gold (1690's) and diamonds (1729), European settlement of the Minas Gerais area in the southeast quickened. In 1808, the Portuguese royal court escaped Napoleon's armies with the help of the British fleet; the prince regent, Dom João VI, sought refuge in Brazil and made it the seat of the Portuguese empire. Dom João returned to Portugal in 1821, leaving his son Dom Pedro behind as prince regent. In 1822, defying orders to return to Portugal and opposed to the reversion of Brazil to colonial status, Dom Pedro declared Brazil's independence and was crowned emperor. In 1825 an agreement mediated by the British led to Portuguese recognition of Brazil as a separate kingdom. The early years of independence were rocky. Dom Pedro became increasingly estranged from his people and began losing control of the Brazilian political situation owing to a continuing series of landowner revolts and to the loss of a war with the United Provinces of Rio de la Plata over what would become Uruguay. In 1831 Dom Pedro abdicated in favor of his five-year-old son, Dom Pedro II; a regency governed Brazil until his accession to the throne in 1840. The Brazilian empire found itself continually involved in the wars and internal politics of Uruguay, Argentina, and Paraguay in the 1850's and 1860's. The bloody five-year war with Paraguay that began in 1865 resulted in Paraguay's eventual defeat, but the process of the war had important consequences for the future of Brazil: the expansion of military power, the fragmentation of the political party system, and the undermining of the legitimacy of slavery. Slavery was abolished in 1888, and the following year, a military coup overthrew the emperor. The “Old Republic,” which lasted from 1889 to 1930, was a federal system in which much of the political control in Brazilian society was relegated to state-based political networks with local bosses. The presidency was assigned in a de facto rotation system called the “politics of the governors,” in which the president's office was controlled by the most important state power networks. The world depression of 1929 hit the Brazilian agricultural export economy hard, and in 1930 the military overthrew the elected president; Getúlio Vargas, a politician from the state of Rio Grande do Sul, took over the presidency. Vargas proceeded to centralize power in the presidency, diminishing states' rights dramatically. Civil unrest allowed Vargas to declare a state of siege with military backing, and in 1937 he declared the establishment of the Estado Novo, a state wherein Vargas had absolute power, in imitation of Portuguese and Italian regimes of the period. The military ousted Vargas in 1945, ushering in the period of the “Second Republic.” Vargas again won re-election in 1950 but committed suicide in 1954. Juscelino Kubitschek, elected president in 1955, sought to develop the country and led the way for construction of the new capital of Brasília in the previously undeveloped interior. His successor, Jânio da Silva Quadros, resigned in 1961 after only seven months in office, and the presidency passed to populist Vice Pres. João Goulart. The populist mobilization of peasants and workers endorsed by the Goulart government led to his overthrow by the military in 1964. The Brazilian military governed the country until 1985. Military rule was not maintained in the form of a dictatorship; rather, the military ruled as a more or less cohesive institution. The succession of generals and their technocratic allies attempted to develop the country through a pattern of state-led growth from which civilian politics were excluded. In 1985, Tancredo Neves was elected president, but he died before taking office. José Sarney, the vice presidential candidate, became Brazil's first civilian president since 1964. Promising to revitalize the economy with a free-market revolution, conservative Fernando Collor de Mello became president in 1990. The military's share of the budget was reduced from 6 to 2.2 percent, and some companies were privatized, but inflation and debt still strained the economy. The 1988 murder of environmental activist Chico Mendes had focused world attention on the rapidly accelerating deforestation of the Amazon River basin. Pres. Collor campaigned actively to halt the destruction and in June 1992 Rio De Janeiro was the site of a U.N.-sponsored conference on development and the environment. Pres. Collor was forced to resign in Dec. 1992 because of charges he stole or misappropriated over $20 million (after a two-year investigation he was cleared of all charges). His successor, Vice Pres. Itamar Franco, worked to privatize industries and halt inflation, but a new corruption scandal involving at least 18 members of the legislature halted most government activity in 1994. In presidential elections held in Oct. 1994, former finance minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso ran on an anti-inflation platform and won a landslide victory. The Cardoso government focused on establishing federal control over state banks and supporting land reform for peasants. The rewards were a dramatic drop in both inflation and unemployment and great popularity for Cardoso. In 1997 Congress passed a Constitutional Amendment permitting Cardoso to run for a second term. In Oct. 1998 Cardoso easily won re-election for a four-year term. Despite an unexpected January 1999 devalutation of the real, the I.M.F. released the remainder of its 1998 aid package in March. In April, Brazil was able to sell $2 billion in bonds—asign of continuing confidence by the world money markets. But Cardoso's popularity suddenly plummeted and in Oct. 2002 elections leftist Luiz da Silva swamped Cardoso-backed Jose Serra in the presidential run-off, while his Workers' Party won a plurality in the Chamber of Deputies and organized the cabinet Brazil"},{"year":"1940","title":"Leaves for Eur on Atlantic Clipper CLIPPER ARRIVES AS ANOTHER GOES","excerpt":"Atlantic Off for Lisbon With 7 Passengers--Bermuda Ship Lands 5 Minutes Later JOHN G.

That world is a surreal video dreamscape in which visual phenomena are continually metamorphosing in ways that used to be described as psychedelic. In scenes shot in the New Mexico desert, the landscape unfolds like a shivering mirage, with the images of faces and mountains furling and dissolving like pictures on a flag in the wind.
