With its climbing skyscrapers and congested streets, its puling energy and unparalleled diversity, New York in the 1920's and 30's was regarded as the prototypical modern city. a symbol of both the possibilities and problems of the industrial age.    But both before and after that period, the city held a deep allure for artists. In 1912, the printmaker Joseph Pennell expressed in rhapsodic terms the attraction the city had for artists of the day, writing that \\"the towering splendor of New York is one of the marvels of the world,\\" and later describing the view of Manhattan from Brooklyn Heights as \\"the most wonderful, the most fairylike, the most magnificent view in the world.\\"    At any given time, pictures of New York past and present are apt to be featured in a wide range of exhibitions around town. Here are a few places to find images of the city in the coming months. Paired Visions    No clearer evidence of artists' enduring fascination with the city can be found than in an exhibition opening Wednesday at the Museum of the City of New York. Titled \\"Shared Perspectives: The Printmaker and Photographer in New York, 1900-1950,\\" this intriguing show will juxtapose prints of familiar places in the city, taken from the collection of Reba and Dave Williams, with photographs of the same locations from the museum's holdings.    The paired prints and photographs provide glimpses of the changing face of the city in the first half of this century. In choosing work for the show, Leslie Nolan, the museum's curator of prints and photographs, tried to find images that showed places in the city from the same point fo view, and as a result viewers can compare sytlistic differences in artists' approaches to their shared subjects.    At times, the pictures are remarkably similar. The hulking form of the el station that hovered above Christopher Street in Greenwich Village, with its pagodalike roof and its gingerbread trim, is depicted both in berenic Aboot's crispy detailed 1936 photographs and in Howard Cook's 1928 woodcut.    Other subjects' allowed artists freedom to play with their subjects' expressive qualities. Times Square at night is presented in shimmering photographs by Samuel H. Gottscho, from 1932, and Andreas Feininger, from around 1950, as well as in a lithograph by Eugene Fitsch from around 1926 in which the bright advertising signs and marquees dance across the paper.    Skyscrapers captivated artists in the first part of the century, and \\"Shared Perspectives\\" abounds with images of the towering buildings that cmae to symbolize New York. John Marin's etching of thw Eoolworth Building, designed byCass Gilbert and the world's tallest building when it was build in 1913, was done shortly after construction was completed.    Irving Underhill's photo, made the same year, offers a more sober depiction of the building's Gothic forms than Marin's giddy impression, but records it with a mixture of down-to-earth factuality and pride.    Lewis Hine's breathtaking photos of the Empire State Building under construction, with workers precariously perched on steel beams high above the city, are echoed in prints by Sherril Schell, James E. Allen and Samuel L. Margolies.    The completed building was, in its turn, the subjet of prints by a number of artists, as well as Edward Steichen's classic multiple-exposure view, made in 1932, of the towering sturcture seen from its base.    Skyscrapers, soaring bridges, run-down tenements and elegant brownstones were all recorded by the artists and photographers included in \\"Shared Perspectives.\\"    But of particular note is a series of pictures of the Flatiron Building, built by the Chicago architect Daniel Burnham in 1902, whose triangular shape entranced artists of the period.    A history of photographic style in the first third of the 20th centurycould be traced through pictures of the oddlyshaped buildings, from Edward Steichen's dreamy Pictorialist rendering of its pointed form, swaddled in blue dusk, made in 1907, to Walter Gropius's Constructivist depiction of it, in 1928, as a sharp diagonal form.    Neither of those famous pictures is here, but \\"Shared Perspectives\\" features photographs of the Flatiron by Jessie Tarbox Beals, from 1906, and by the T.H. McAllister Company, from 1909, as well","excerpt":"as a 1908 mezzotint of the building byPennell and an etching by Childe Hassam from 1916. Paired Artists    Among the many other prominent photographers who tried their hands at depicting the Flatiron Building was Alfred Stieglitz, who is featured as an artist and an influence intwo important exhibitions in the city this spring.    Stieglitz and Georgia O'Keeffe played out much of their fabled romance against the backdrop of New York, and the city plays an important role in \\"Two Lives: A Conversation in Paintings and Photographs,\\" an exhibition opening April 27 at the I.B.M. Gallery of Science and Art that willfocus on the work of these two proud artists.    Stieglitz, the legendary photographer and central figure in the introduction of modern art to America, first say O'Keeffe's abstract watercolors in 1915 and immediately decided to show them at 291, his pioneering gallery.Later, the two met and fell in love, beginning a stormy personal and artistic relationship that would last three decades.    Much of the show at the I.B.M. Gallery will consist of O'Keefe's close-up abstractions of flowers and other natural forms and Stieglitz's studies of clouds over his country house in Lake George, N.Y., as well as his portraits of O'Keeffe.    But New York City was an important subject for both artists, and \\"Two Lives\\" will include examples of their depictions of the city.    Steiglitz is represented by a soft-focus view of the lower Manhattan skyline from 1910, as well as moody shots of skyscrapers at dusk from the early 1930's, while O'Keeffe's hallucinatory painting of New York City, from the mid-1920's, emphasize its dizzying perspectives. Another Protegee    In a coincidence of scheduling, Stieglitz and New York are strong presences in another exhibition this spring. The International Center of Photography is presenting, through June 27, \\"Intimate Visions: The Photographs of Dorothy Norman.\\" Mrs. Norman met Stieglitz in 1928, worked with him at his gallery An American Place and began to photograph under his tutelage.    The show includes a range of Mrs. Norman's pictures of Stieglitz himself, with his distinctive black cape, wire-rimmed glasses and shaggy white mustache, as well as portraits of such artists and intellecutals as Elia Kazan, Harold Clurman, Charles Demuth and Edgard Varese. Also featured are Mrs. Norman's tiny, jewel-like images of New York, most of which date from the 1930's. In these quiet pictures, none bigger than a hand, she reduced the overlapping buildings of the city to collagelike patterns of dark and light forms. A Defining Era    As a booming metropolis of skyscrapers and industry, New York achieved pre-eminence between the world wars. But many of the buildings that define the city today were built earlier. In a period that stretched from roughly 1880 to 1930, a group of architects, many of whom had studied at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, produced public and private buildings, based on classical European models, that expressed the city's new wealth and self-confidence.    Some of the city's most famous landmarks were built in this period, including the Woolworth Building, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and Grand Central Terminal. These and other buildings of the time are featured in \\"Beaux-Arts New York,\\" an exhibition at the New York School of Interior Design through May 13.    Theough period photographs, architectural drawings, sketches and other documents, the exhibition records the flowering of the Beaux-Arts style in New York in such famous buildings as the Old Penn Station, designed by McKim, Mead & White, which was opened in 1910 and destroyed in 1965; the Brooklyn Museum, also by McKim, Mead & White (1897), and the New York Public Library, by Carrere & Hastings (1911). Then and Now    Images of New York can also be found in other exhibitions around the city this spring. Through Jan. 2, the Alice Austen House on Staten Island is Presenting \\"A Century Apart,\\" in which photographs of Staten Island by Austen, a wealthy turn-of-the-century amateur, are being shown alongside contemporary images by Lisa Clifford, an architectural photographer. And in SoHo, Helen Levitt's marvelous photographs of children playing in the city streets in the early 1940's are being featured through May 15 in a show at the Laurence Miller Gallery, along with photographs of children at play in Spain and England by Henri Cartier-Bresson and Roger Mayne.    Pictures of the city can be found in many places, and not just in special shows. The recently reinstalled permanent exhibition of the photography collection at the Museum of Modern Art includes a 1910 Stieglitz photograph of an ocean liner leaving New York Harbor, as well as Aaron Siskind's 1936 shot which has the noble austerity of a photograph by Eugene Atget; he has a friend there, on of the concessionaires, who sometimes discreetly gives him a break on lunch. Or he checks out the Conservatory Water, a concrete pool where visitors watch silent and stern middle-aged men sailing remote-control model yachts; the snack bar there offers the best hot dog in the park. \\"I'm moving all over the place,\\" he says. \\"You've got to deal with allsorts of shady characters in the park. They're not all lollipops, you know.\\"    But Poet O.'sheart is somehow tied to Strawberry Fields. He currently has a room in a hotel for the elderly on West 43d Street, but \\"my big dream is to get an apartment in the Dakota, right there on the corner,\\" he says wistfully. He has a poem, \\"Grief,\\" that he wrote during the all-night vigil after Lennon wasshot; he says it was later published by Hunter College. If bell-ringers seem particularly attentive to Poet O.'s kooky commands, he will sometimes reward them with a rousing and theatrical reading of the work. Hos words tumble out, here smooth and clipped and manicured, there coarse and stuttered and guttural, depending on the sentiment.    Or if the wishers be lovers, he will sometimes recite another poem, \\"A Fantasy Delight\\": \\"Let (bland) and (blank)\\" - fill in the names of lovers - \\"take a memorable voyage calculated to please, complete relaxation is a necessary part of our trip, free from the ties of our daily vexations, we must enjoy our paradoxical fantasy to the utmost . . . \\"    On paper, Poet O.'s words glimmer with a deep-rooted majesty, but his is not an art of the printed page. It is as lush and tumultuous and grimy and resplendent and uncontainable as Central Park itself. Suddenly he leans in close, and his rugged, venerable face cracks into a mischievous grin. \\"I know every corner of this park,\\" he whispers. \\"I know all its characters and hiding places. I know its secrets.\\"   Here are the addresses, hours and admission prices for the exhibitions mentioned: \\"SHARED PERSPECTIVES: THE PRINTMAKER AND PHOTOGRAPHER IN NEW YORK, 1900-1950.\\" Museum of the City of New York, Fifth Avenue at 103d Street.

The Trustees and staff of The Metropolitan Museum of Art mourn with profound sadness the passing of Walter H. Annenberg, who for more than four decades demonstrated on a breathtaking scale his passion for art and his support of this institution. With his wife, Leonore, he based his philanthropy at the Metropolitan on the understanding that great museum collections remain great by continuing to evolve and to grow. Through a series of landmark gestures-gifts of works of art from masterpieces by Van Gogh to masterpieces of Asian sculpture, along with major grants for acquisitions-they have enhanced the very heart of the Metropolitan Museum, its collections, for generations to come. Walter Annenberg was involved in countless other ways as well: as a Trustee and benefactor","excerpt":"as a committed supporter of education in the arts; and as the donor of a major challenge grant that has enabled the Museum to build a new Center For Imaging and Photography. But his most spectacular gesture was the decision in 1991 to bequeath his collection of fifty-three Impressionist and Post-Impressionist paintings, watercolors, and drawings to the Museum, the largest single gift of art to the Metropolitan in more than a quarter century. Since 1993, this outstanding collection has been in residence at the Museum for six months of each year for all to enjoy. Walter's motto was ''strength to strength,'' and his legacy of sweeping generosity will be held dear by us and by the museum-going public in perpetuity. We extend our deepest condolences to Mrs. Annenberg and to the entire family. James R. Houghton, Chairman Philippe de Montebello, Director David E. McKinney, President     ANNENBERG-Hon. Walter H. It is with deep sorrow that Congregation Emanu-El of the City of New York records the passing of Ambassador Walter H. Annenberg, whose life will forever be inscribed among the histories of our nations' greatest citizens. His years of service as our Ambassador to the Court of St. James were noteworthy by the wisdom and skill which he brought to that sensitive diplomatic post. Likewise, the worlds of learning and education have been immeasurably enriched by his on-going, caring concerns. He brought to his extraordinary philanthropy a unique creativeness, so much so that it is impossible to calculate how many millions of lives have been improved because of his peerless commitments. As in the worlds of education, so in the realms of art and beauty, his gifts have brought joy to the heart and delight to the eye. He walked among us as a caring, sensitive leader and the works of his hands will endure as monuments to the qualities that were the hallmarks of his inner being. With his beloved Leonore, and the other members of the family, we mourn his passing while giving thanks for his life. The memory of Ambassador Walter H. Annenberg will endure as a magnificent blessing. Dr. David M. Posner, Senior Rabbi Dr. Ronald B. Sobel, Senior Rabbi Emeritus Mr. Robert A. Bernhard, President Mr. Herbert C.

Annenberg of St. Davids, Pennsylvania, and Rancho Mirage, California. A media giant, statesman, and magnanimous philanthropist, Mr. Annenberg served as Ambassador to Great Britain and was awarded the United States Medal of Freedom. The ATS and the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology benefited from Mr. Annenberg's legendary generosity with unrestricted funding, which was used to recruit talented new faculty. The Ambassador and his wife, Leonore, were Technion Guardians, signifying the highest level of commitment.

Universally acclaimed for his integrity by all who knew him, including Bishops, Deans, Governors, Legislators, Judges and fellow citizens on the streets of New York, Bernard Newman consistently credited his parents, and his wife for 59 years, Kathryn Bereano, and his life time friend and surviving spouse, Fritzi W. Rudolph, for his sterling reputation. A Governor of New York, once marveled how Bernard ''could engage in political activities and in a post of leadership and retain his...reputation for integrity.'' Born on October 28, 1907 to Isidor J. and Sarah C. Newman, and life time resident of New York City, Bernard Newman was a gentleman of profound wisdom, integrity and generosity, and a man of great compassion. More significantly Bernard Newman was a man completely devoted and dedicated to his family, and tremendously adored and loved by his family and friends. An honor graduate of the college and law school of New York University and an Associate Editor of the Law Review, Bernard Newman was a lawyer's lawyer and a judge's judge. As a young attorney, Bernard was attracted at an early age to public service. First as an Assistant Corporation Counsel assigned to the office of Chamberlain A.A. Berle, Jr., and next as a law secretary to New York State Supreme Court Justice, Samuel H. Hofstadler. For 16 years, presiding justices David W. Peck and Bernard Botein designated lawyer Newman an official referee of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court. On December 12, 1965, Mayor Robert F. Wagner, Jr. appointed him to the family court, which was followed by an appointment to the State Supreme Court by Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller. Then, on July 21, 1968, President Lyndon B. Johnson, nominated the Judge to the Customs Court, situated in New York. The jurisdiction of which was expanded by Congress in 1980 under the name United States Court of International Trade. Judge Newman, who delighted in the distinction of having been appointed by Mayor, the Governor, and the President, presided for more than 30 years over complex Federal Customs and international trade cases, while also sitting in recent years in the federal district court in Manhattan. Judge Newman also once served as Council to, and Chairman of, the New York County Republican Party","excerpt":"as a delegate to Republican National Nominating Conventions; as a referee on special panels of the New York State Labor Relations and Mediation Boards. Judge Newman also was a Director of the Civic Center Synagogue, Community, Synagogue Center, Metropolitan Advisory Board of Anti Defamation League, and Laguardia Memorial Association. He was also the recipient of the Judge Edward Weinfeld Award, and Man of the Year Award. In addition to his wife Fritzi, the Judge is survived by daughters Phyllis Cechini and Helene Bernstein, grandchildren Craig and Kathy, John and Kathy, Mark and Hayley Cechini, Scott and Marcia, Brad and Annette Bernstein, and eight great-grandchildren.

And about time.This Columbia release offers nothing new by way of a story. Under the command of a tough captain, a handful of British soldiers are trapped by the Japanese in the Burmese jungle. With half of his group slaughtered, the officer must decide whether to sacrifice the survivors to their captors to save some valuable information. Nothing new, assuredly.Furthermore, the entire film—a small clearing, a few thatched huts and the surrounding jungle thickness—could be dropped into a television studio. A predominantly male cast, headed by Stanley Baker, the direction of Val Guest, a scenario by Peter R. Newman, and the trigger-sharp photography—all have combined somehow to effect a tingling, dramatic sermon on bravery.Mr. Guest has suspensefully stitched together action, abetted by some terse, realistic dialogue. Off to a good, gory start, the picture is interspersed with small-scale battle scenes that slash at the camera eye like a machete.The characterizations — among them a brave chaplain, a cynical war correspondent, a frightened young lieutenant and a gritty sergeant—are brought into clear, convincing focus, as the men await capture. And the crux of the matter—their unpopular leader's battle of wits with a diabolically shrewd Japanese officer is admirably revolved in a grim climax.If the talk is a little plentiful now and then, not to say philosophical, the actors generally look, sound and behave like real soldiers. Mr. Baker, as the captain and the toughest of the lot, gives the best performance of his career","excerpt":"as a Japanese major, Philip Ahn is excellent.

President of the Metropolitan Opera Guild since 1986, he loved opera passionately, and rejoiced in telling how he had first discovered it by listening to the Texaco-Metropolitan Opera radio broadcasts as a young man. He was deeply committed to the Guild's aims of supporting the Metropolitan Opera and broadening opera audiences through essential programs, notably those aimed at young people. A man of great optimism, infinite personal charm, and lively wit, he earned the respect and affection of all those members of our company who had the privilege of experiencing his warmth and unfailingly courteous sense of human relationships. All of us in our company have lost a very dear, generous, and valuable friend, and he will be sorely missed. We extend our deepest sympathy and condolences to his wife, Elizabeth, and his daughters, Emily and Rachel. Joseph Volpe, General Manager James Levine, Artistic Director    PETERS-Alton E. His many friends and admirers at Christie's are saddened by the untimely loss of this kind and most generous man. While his first enthusiasm was for opera and for music in general, he was a frequent and exceedingly welcome visitor to auction sales and exhibitions, and enjoyed supporting events at the Morgan Library and other institutions. He collected books and shared with his wife Elizabeth a particular taste for Old Master Drawings and English watercolours, and indeed for Venice. Yet people remained his chief interest. He delighted in being helpful, whether over large things or small, and a newcomer to New York could be sure of the warmest of welcomes. He was always eager to make new friends and his unfailing warmth and loyalty to old ones made the strongest impression, one which will remain with all those who had the good fortune to know him.

Illustrated. 645 pp. New York: Villard Books. $24.95. BASEBALL cards have long had a special place in the hearts of fans. Cards have been associated with bubble gum and youngsters since the early 1930's. Before learning to ride a two-wheeler, many children become adept at trading, flipping, matching or simply collecting baseball cards. But as long ago as the 1880's, cards were packaged with cigarettes, not gum, and prized by adults more than children. Indeed, the association of baseball cards with tobacco is responsible for the most valuable card of all, the Honus Wagner, distributed with Sweet Caporal cigarettes in 1910. The great Pittsburgh Pirate shortstop disliked cigarettes so much he insisted that the tobacco company recall and destroy all cards bearing his likeness","excerpt":"as a result, the few 1910 Wagners that remain now command $25,000 in mint condition.   Topps Chewing Gum Inc. began to distribute baseball cards with bubble gum in 1951 and soon dominated the market. This extraordinary book, which measures about 10 by 14 inches and weighs more than 9 pounds, contains full-color reproductions of every baseball card issued by Topps from 1951 through this year - more than 21,000 in all.

Here we are, five years later, and many people fear a deep, fullfledged banana. In fact, some who write about the economy (an ''economic writer'' is a writer who uses as few words as possible) have broken the taboo: We are witnessing a boom in the outspoken usage of the word ''depression.''   ''I don't want to start a panic,'' Edward Yardeni of E.F. Hutton & Company told The Wall Street Journal (when Yardeni speaks, everybody panics), ''but I think there's a 30 percent chance of a depression occurring.''   This unabashed public use of the dirtiest word in economics led to its prompt adoption by the media. ABC's Sam Donaldson asked Senator Edward Kennedy if ''we are going to tip over into a real bread-line depression,'' receiving the reply, ''If you asked any auto worker out in Detroit, they would say that we are in a depression at the present time.'' Asked the same question, another potential Democratic Presidential candidate, Robert Strauss, said, ''We've got one foot in a depression in some sectors.''

In doing so, he suggests in his catalogue essay, these artists, who include Andy Warhol, Richard Artschwager, Ellen Brooks, Mark Tansey and Joseph Nechvatal, create a kind of \\"esthetics of the 'mechanical.' \\"    With this argument Mr. Tillim offers a direct challenge to one of the central texts of modern art criticism. In an essay published in 1936 under the cumbersome title \\"The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction,\\" the German critic Walter Benjamin argued that photographs, and photographic reproductions, destroyed the sense of uniqueness and special value that had always surrounded art objects.

She stubbornly battled yet another bout with cancer, but was unable to beat it this time. Sydney was born Aug. 1, 1928, in Long Island, New York, to Sidney and Virginia Maranov. She enjoyed her youth on Long Island, telling us stories about her adventures at Coney Island, Jones Beach, and the beautiful riding country where she rode her horse, Flight. Sydney's horse was designated as as alternate on the U.S. Olympic Riding Team.She was also an accomplished dog breeder and shower, having one dog win ''Best of Breed'' in 1945 at the famous Westminster Kennel Club dog show. She graduated from Cornell University as a doctor of veterinary medicine, and as all who knew her are aware, loved all creatures large and small. Sydney worked in a wartime factory during WWII. Sydney and her husband Frank, now deceased, moved to Phoenix in 1956 with their two young sons, Russ and Craig. Initially, Sydney worked officially as a housewife, and unofficially served as the neighborhood veterinarian in the small suburb north of Phoenix at 32nd St. and Bell Rd. then known as Paradise Valley. Sydney was involved with many activities in the neighborhood, including being a Cub Scout den mother, and participating in 4-H, YMCA and Civic Association activities. Sydney and Frank continued growing their family in Arizona, having 2 more sons, Reid and Brook, and finally a daughter, Jessica. Sydney was always a bit quirky yet authoritative, and was devoted to and demanding of her children, teaching us all to be responsible and independent thinkers. With her small body and strong voice, Sydney will be remembered as ''Mom'' by many other young individuals whom she tutored, nurtured, and otherwise supported and guided over the years. Sydney was a grandmother of five and great grandmother to one. In later years, Sydney retired from more than 20 years of service at Motorola, where she routinely worked the night shift. Realizing that retirement was not for her, she soon ''un-retired'' to work as a cashier at Rawhide","excerpt":"as a school crossing guard and tutor in the Paradise Valley school district; and most recently as a cashier for Harkins Theatres on Bell Road. She made many friends during these times and will certainly be remembered by all as an unforgettable, strong and opinionated woman, with a real sense of humor. She was adored and will be sorely missed by her children, grandchildren, great-grandchild, relatives, friends and yes, even the pets. An informal memorial service to share memories and photos will be held at 11 a.m., Saturday, Nov. 11, 2006, at Harkins North Valley 16 Theatres, located at 3420 E. Bell Rd. Phoenix, AZ 85032.

She received a BA degree from DePauw University in Greencastle, Indiana, majoring in mathematics, with a minor in Greek, and enjoyed her legacy as a third generation member of Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority. Mary moved to Chicago after college and worked at the Harris Trust and Savings Bank. She married Lloyd Byron Johnson, who died of cancer in 1962. She subsequently married Harvey E.

And it is to remind us of the fight which the American people have waged to win and hold their civil liberties, especially against \\"the fascist-minded on our own soil\\" in recent years, that Frontier Films is presenting the feature-length documentary film, \\"Native Land,\\" which opened at the World Theatre last evening after a production period filled with difficulties.Manifestly, this is one of the most powerful and disturbing documentary films ever made, and certainly it will provoke much thought and controversy. For \\"Native Land\\" is a graphic presentation through re-enacted scenes of incidents of brutal violations of the American Bill of Rights as revealed in actual testimony before the Senate Civil Liberties Committee in 1938. It is, to put it bluntly, a sharp indictment of certain subversive elements in this land—elements which are never precisely identified, other than by such terms as \\"the big shots,\\" \\"the interests\\" and \\"powerful corporations,\\" but which emerge by implication as all foes of free speech, of free assembly and the active opponents of labor organization.And in its presentation of evidence—evidence which cannot be denied—this picture is a brilliant achievement in documentary cinema. Leo Hurwitz and Paul Strand, who directed it and are chiefly responsible for its production, have selected their material with care and have placed it upon the screen with such bite and dramatic intensity as would make the best directors of films take solemn note. Every sequence, every incident, is composed with an eye to rigid suspense, and the sense of violence and outrage is carried straight through the film.There is one surpassingly fine sequence showing an assault upon a Michigan farmer (1934) who had dared raise his voice in a grange meeting, another re-enacting the pursuit and eventual murder by vigilantes of two Arkansas sharecroppers (1936), yet another harrowing illustration of the torture of three Florida men by Ku Klux Klansmen (1935) and one long and somewhat involved sequence, which forms the center of the film, showing the treacherous activities of a company-employed labor spy.The incidents are threaded together with a commentary, narrated by Paul Robeson, and a series of roving camera tie-ups which carry the general theme of America's love for freedom and the unconquerable strength of our people as a whole. It is an eloquent message, and the musical score by Marc Blitzstein gives it emotional lift, particularly through one passage wherein Mr. Robeson sings a stirring chant, \\"American Day.\\" But there is a certain formality about these bridges which gives them a routine quality","excerpt":"as a whole, the picture lacks the cohesion of its truly superb episodes. That may also be because the actors—Art Smith as the labor spy, Howard da Silva as a \\"stool-pigeon,\\" Fred Johnson as the farmer, and many more — portray such believable characters that one is inclined toward relaxation when they are off the screen.Of course, a fundamental question might be raised as to what point this picture makes without naming the actual oppressors, other than that oppression is an evil thing. And one might also inquire whether a picture of this sort is not disturbing to national unity at this time. On the latter score, the producers have obviously endeavored to reassure, through a postscript spoken by Mr. Robeson, that labor and all elements in the nation have closed ranks against a common foe. As to the first question, one must make up one's own mind. The film concludes with words spoken over the grave of one of the victims of the Memorial Day massacre outside Chicago in 1937. \\"We don't forget that,\\" the speaker says. And that is the portentous note on which this impassioned film ends.

The film, written by Jane Stanton Hitchcock and David Freeman, is scheduled for Paramount production this January by Lawrence Turman and David Foster. At the Movies"},{"year":"1932","title":"ABOUT six months ago it was generally agreed in the German film world that the public was tired of film operettas. From then on drama was coming into its own again. But this revelation doesn't seem to have trickled through to the producers—or maybe they have decided that the audiences are ready for this style of entertainment again. For within the last few weeks we have been simply flooded with music. The productions ran the scale from farce with music to full-fledged opera. Unless you were melodically inclined, the only thing to do was to stay away from the cinema palaces.The most engagingly lyric of the lot was \\"Ein blonder Tram\\" (\\"A Blond Dream\\") at the Gloria Palast. Here the Ufa and Erich Pommer are up on the crest again. This picture deserves a place in the royal line of \\"Drei von der Tankstelle\\" and \\"Einbrecher.\\" These Pommer-supervised films must be ranked with the musicals of Ernst Lubitsch. They have the same chinchilla lightness, the same swinging tunes, the same good-humored sophistication. The only really vital difference is that the humors of the Hollywood comedies are heartier, the Germans tend more toward stylization and atmosphere.A Romance of Common Life.\\"A Blond Dream\\" is a very excellent sample of what Pommer is striving for. The scenario by Walter Reisch is conventional, almost hackneyed. But this very conventionality has its place in the scheme. It takes the accent away from the story and places it on the personalities of the players, on the nuances of the director, on the gayety of the music. There would be considerably less high-hatting of the average operetta libretto of stage or screen if it were recognized that it is unoriginal and naïve with a purpose.So, \\"Ein blonder Traum\\" is just a tale of two youthful window cleaners who are in love with a little acrobatic dancer. On a field outside the city they fix up a discarded railway car as a house for her. When both propose to her, she runs away, for she cannot bear to hurt either of them. A \\"famous\\" American manager is in town, and her persistency, much more than her ability as a dancer, persuades him to engage her for Hollywood. But one of the boys, realizing that she is in love with his friend, eloquently convinces the manager that he should leave the girl to marry and live a contented home existence. So, impressed by his flow of language, he decides to take the boy along with him as a buffer against the young women who are continually besieging his office.And the girl is Lilian Harvey, the boys, Willi Fritsch and Willi Forst. Lilian, who will soon be leaving these parts for Hollywood, here does her best screen work. She has dropped most of her mannerisms without losing any of ner charm and her comedy has gained in depth. Willi Fritsch is as youthfully sympathetic as ever and Willi Forst has not lost any of his kid-glove slickness. Among the Pommer directorial inspirations was the girl's dream of her reception in Hollywood, the most effective bit of fantastic comedy that the cinema has had to offer us for a long time. And, underneath and around it all, the melodies of Werner Heymann, whose music to \\"Congress Dances\\" has carried his name around the world.Complications From Advertising.Of the same type but less so was \\"Sehnsucht 202\\" (\\"Longing 202\\") at the Gloria Palast. Behind its scenario was the amusing notion of a muddled want ad. The advertisement of a rich young girl, who wants to invest her money in a firm, is mixed up with that of a stenographer looking for a position. The complications are worked out with skill and evident knowledge of the rules of the game. Magda Schneider as the heroine was as impersonally pleasing as ever, Fritz Schulz did not let a comedy point get by and the cast was rounded smoothly by Rolf van Goth and Paul Kemp. Richard Fall has composed a song, \\"Mein Schatz, ich bin in Dein Parfüm verliebt\\" (\\"Sweetheart, I'm in Love With Your Perfume\\"), which will have a bad break if it remains within Central European dance orchestra borders. I have spent many worse two hours with camera and microphone.And now deeper into the tonal sea. \\"Die oder Keine\\" (\\"Her or Nobody\\") is full-fledged operetta with a squint at opera. In the course of the action we are even treated to an aria and part of an act from \\"Traviata.\\" And Otto Stransky's music is orchestral in the comic opera manner. But even people who don't ordinarily care for this type of entertainment will forgive the producer for bathing us so lavishly in the melodic, for he had the exciting voice of Gitta Alpar to run through its paces. This film gets pretty close to giving us 100 per cent of the qualities which have made Miss Alpar the favorite musical comedy star of the German stage. Her voice has the Hungarian languor and dark softness","excerpt":"as an actress she has evanescent vitality and high spirits; her figure is trim (although her face would have given Praxiteles a bad afternoon). So the director, Carl Froehlich, has my approbation in making her sing in almost every scene. The audience is caught up in her web of sound and never let loose.The story starts pleasantly and conventionally enough with an opera prima donna who is beloved by two princes, both of whom believe she thinks that-they are private citizens. They are both present at a performance of \\"Traviata\\" in which she is singing the leading rôle, and in order to get to her first one of them wanders onto the stage in modern evening dress among the rococo costumes of the rest of the cast. Then the film slides into sophomoric pretentiousness. The two princes' uncle, ruler of one of those fabulous Balkan kingdoms, has died and the two princes have equal chances for the throne. Need it be said that the leading man with the aid of the singer gets the job away from the first character comedian? If it only hadn't taken him such a tediously long time. Here, Carl Froelich, who supervised \\"Maedchen in Uniform,\\" shows that he has all the symptoms of the film director's favorite disease—he can't bear to part with any of his directorial notions, whether they hold up the action or not. A pair of shears would have been Elizabeth Arden to the evening.And finally, head foremost under the melodic waves: At the Atrium \\"The Bartered Bride,\\" the \\"first German audible film opera.\\" The Reichsliga Film Company deserves encouragement for this experiment, and I wish I could be enthusiastic. But if this is the way film operas are going to look, they had better be left to the opera houses and flesh-and-blood singers. What was served us was merely a lukewarm mixture with neither the melodic advantages of opera nor the dramatic and pictorial ones of the film. The director, Max Ophuels, really sidestepped the problem completely. Very little of either the music or the plot of Smetana's immortal opera, \\"The Bartered Bride,\\" is used. And the story which is put in its place is certainly no improvement, the skimmed music no substitute for the warm-blooded stream of the original. And this is all the more to be regretted, as he had the exceptional voices of Jarmila Novotna and Willi Domgraf-Fassbaender at his disposal in the leading rôles. Only once did he point the way to a possible development of this style. That was the famous aria of the marriage broker, which was given life and movement by being sung as he ran through a flight of rooms. But this was only a suggestion.And what music there was in the film was left sadly in the lurch by the reproducing equipment in the Atrium Theatre. German recording is up to world standard, but the reproducing is still as primitive as it was three years ago. It's really a wonder that the Germans have accepted the talker so whole-heartedly—we would run, not walk, out of a theatre where the loud-speakers squeak and groan so piteously.At the R K O radio studios they are preparing to make a film of \\"The Goose Woman,\\" the short story by Rex Beach. This is the tale of the grand opera star who loses her voice after her son is born, turns chicken farmer and express her general bitterness toward life by drinking to excess. Samuel Ornitz, the author of \\"Haunch, Paunch and Jowl,\\" is preparing the script.

Sergeant Ray wears shiny dark jackets with ugly yellow squares, a white shirt, a greasy tie, hair slicked back and thinnish, a black leather coat that makes his bulk look brutal.His disgust and weariness come out as violence, barely repressed and sometimes not even that","excerpt":"as cunning, quite unrepressed and showing through. He is the head of a three-member squad set up to deal with truant, shoplifting or otherwise unmanageable children in Liverpool. He is the central figure in a moving and distressing documentary, \\"Juvenile Liaison,\\" being shown at the Film Forum, 15 Vandam Street.It is a film that is far more intelligent than its viewpoint. This, in a documentary, is praise: It does not restrict the viewer to its own conclusions.The viewpoint is clear enough. We see the sergeant, huge and menacing, cross-examine an 8-year-old Indian girl at her school. Her teachers say she has a consistent record of pilfering things from her schoolmates' bags and desks. Continually hinting that he can take her down to the police station if she doesn't tell the truth, he badgers her about an apple, about some missing pencils.It is a painful sight: This big, ugly man reducing a frail and lovely little girl to incoherence and tears. And yet she is, as it turns out, a liar and a thief. She has produced, around her, all kinds of small chaos, small injustices: She has embedded them in the minds of the children around her. They have lost apples and pencils, the little securities of childhood, and have found no recourse.The movie stresses the disproportion between the tiny miscreants and their large and strident pursuers. There is an immensely affecting scene where a policewoman snarls and scolds at a fat adolescent girl who has been shoplifting. She batters at her: Isn't she ashamed? Doesn't she think of her parents? Does she want a criminal record?' The great balloon of a girl sits stolidly and silently and then, as the buzz-saw voice goes on, tears squeeze from her eyes. And she admits, most touchingly, to one real ambition: She wants to be a prison warden. \\"Not a chance,\\" the policewoman says.There are other, similar scenes. The film makers show the threat of brutality rather than real brutality, though at one point Sergeant Ray drags a 15-year-old boy — who has beaten his mother — out of bed by the hair.The intended message is that the youth squad is a blind and cruel response by society to its errant children. Sergeant Ray's explanation — that by making a show of firmness, by making it clear to the children what will happen if they don't reform, some are saved from later, serious involvement with the law — is treated as a rationalization.Maybe so. But as we watch these ill-prepared, harassed, unequipped, desperately tired officers go about their job, a troubling sympathy grows up for them. In these working-class, often fatherless homes, Sergeant Ray, coming from the same class, uses far more patience, far less violence than the fathers themselves might have used.The sergeant and his colleagues believe in what they are trying to do, even though they have no illusions about their success. They are medical corpsmen, sent out to treat the wounds of social dismemberment with splints.They are rough and sometimes mean, but they are also heroic. The film does not see the heroism, but it lets us see it. It sees the entrapment used by the police officers on the children; it lets us see the entrapment in which the officers find themselves.In the harshest scene, Sergeant Ray feigns to arrest a little boy and sits with him in a jail cell to show him what it is like. The film stresses the child's terror and the barbarity of the device. But what we really see is two people in jail — the boy and the policeman — companions in frustration and helplessness.

It is the sort of picture one can talk through without missing anything, and if conversation should happen to lag, one can ask one's companion why the woman does that, and wonder what is the matter with the man. If you look up suddenly you may see a streak of lightning: then a man and a woman safe inside a runabout, with rain falling in sheets on the wind shield. The woman pretends to be afraid of the lightning and flops into the man's arms, and when she lifts her frightened eyes to his. her lips come nearer and—the man brings about a terrible lot of trouble on himself by pressing a kiss on the freshly rouged lips.The man is Joseph Greer and the woman is none other than his partner's wife, Violet Williamson. This is one incident in the life of an inventor of a new linen process. He married \\"above his station\\" and his wife and little girl went to Hollywood, leaving him all alone. Soon Mrs. Greer writes that she wishes to marry again, and Mr. Greer sends $1,000 for his daughter to come on to Chicago from the film city. Beatrice is a hot-headed wilful girl, who at first refuses to kiss her father, which prompts him to say:\\"The only woman who ever kissed me, and did not wish to, was your mother.\\"When Mr. Greer is a guest at the country home of some terribly important person, he is supposed to feel flattered when he is told that Elizabeth looks like a Christy bathing girl. Society people are alluded to by this Hollywood writer of belles lettres as \\"stall fed.\\"There is a chance to see an automobile being driven at more than fifty miles an hour which, when it strikes a telegraph pole, does not even receive a dent.

Adapted loosely from stories by Luigi Pirandello (the title in fact comes from a Pirandello quotation about the derivation of ''Cavusu,'' the name of a forest near his native village), ''Kaos'' tells four separate tales of Sicilian life. These fables, plus an epilogue about the author himself, are united by their shared imagery, their strong sense of community, their final ironies and the clear, graceful way in which they are told.   ''Kaos'' unfolds with the rapturous simplicity that was most apparent in ''Padre, Padrone,'' the first of the Taviani brothers' films to be released here, and that is even more mesmerizing this time. Yet ''Kaos'' also has an edge. The Pirandello influence makes itself felt in the twists of fate that turn each tale's principals against prevailing values, and in the bittersweet note on which the stories conclude","excerpt":"as for the Tavianis, their contribution is an earthy, knowing storytelling style that finds a folk wisdom in the characters' humanity.

But she falls into some errors that one would have wished her to avoid.    First, Wollstonecraft's claim to be ''the first of a new genus'' is not to be found in ''A Vindication of the Rights of Woman'' but comes, rather, in a private letter to her sister Everina.    Second, Bentley repeats -- unfortunately, taking her information from Gordon -- that deeply entrenched belief about the ''rule of thumb,'' pertaining to the width of a stick with which a husband may beat his wife. This was painstakingly, if obscurely, blasted out of the water by Henry Ansgar Kelly in '' 'Rule of Thumb' and the Folklaw of the Husband's Stick,'' in the September 1994 issue of the Journal of Legal Education. This is not to say that the legal situation of women in the late 18th century, and long before and after, was anything less than crippling","excerpt":"as Gordon points out, it was worse in the 18th century than it had been in Norman times. But the authoritative jurist William Blackstone's opinion in 1778 was that although in earlier times a husband's violence against his wife had been legally condoned, things were different now: ''In the politer reign of Charles II, this power of correction began to be doubted . . . and a wife may now have security of the peace against her husband . . . or, in return, a husband against his wife.''    Finally, most disturbing is Bentley's assertion that ''we women'' have a genetic proclivity for ''high drama.'' The editors magnify the irritation power of this statement a hundredfold by putting it on the cover of the Book Review. It's most disturbing because this statement runs so wholly counter both to Wollstonecraft's work and to Lyndall Gordon's biography. Any Wollstonecraft biographer has to take up the powerful tension between emotion and reason in her subject's life, and there's no doubt that Wollstonecraft's life ran to extremes. But Gordon is at pains to stress Wollstonecraft's self-imposed and careful rationality in her political writing. It is disappointing that Bentley's review, and your editorial decisions, should so deny Wollstonecraft's hope that women might remake themselves as kinder and saner beings, and that their labor might transform others as well.

But these days people are expected to settle into narrower cubbyholes, so John Cale is viewed as a rocker with pretentious leanings. Since co-founding the Velvet Underground in 1963, Mr.  Cale has never quite settled into a comfortable spot, either artistically or commercially, but he has gained a tenacious cult following happy to accompany him on his musical wanderings.   On Saturday evening, Mr. Cale performed solo and with the Soldier Quartet and Sterling Morrison, the Velvet Underground's bassist. Mr. Cale has performed nearly the same set for years, often without inspiration. But he has finally discovered a way to refresh his own familiar melodies, and his renditions of chestnuts like \\"Guts,\\" \\"Buffalo Ballet\\" and \\"The Chinese Envoy\\" reached the songs' essential beauty, built of wonder, playfulness and sorrow's calm.   Starting with three songs based on Dylan Thomas poems, he worked through material from all phases of his career. The influence of Tin Pan Alley and the British music hall on Mr. Cale was never clearer","excerpt":"as he banged out a boogie-woogie piano beat and crooned in his patented world-weary way, he seemed like an eccentric cousin of Cole Porter's. Mr. Cale's rock side emerged when he picked up an acoustic guitar and bashed through \\"The Ballad of Cable Hogue\\" as if he were thinking of a young Bob Dylan. Mr. Morrison and the Soldier String Quartet added horror-movie color to his trademark performance of \\"Heartbreak Hotel.\\"   The evening's biggest treat came at the first encore, when Lou Reed strode onstage in suburban casuals, guitar strapped to his chest. Mr. Cale, Mr. Reed and Mr. Morrison launched into \\"Style It Takes,\\" from \\"Songs for Drella,\\" the 1990 Reed-Cale tribute to Andy Warhol. Only the crucial absence of the drummer Maureen Tucker kept this from being a Velvet Underground reunion. Mr. Reed's aggressive playing dominated the proceedings, but the three men did listen to one another, building a fractured reflection of the foundational Velvet sound. The trio continued with Mr. Cale's song \\"Forever Changed.\\" Then Mr. Reed left the stage and the history-making was over for the night.   Mr. Cale returned with everyone but Mr. Reed, including the show's opening act, the talented experimental guitarist Michael Brook, for a rather anticlimactic rendition of Leonard Cohen's \\"Hallelujah.\\" Then he returned alone to perform two of his most poignant ballads, \\"The Thoughtless Kind\\" and \\"Close Watch.\\" As he sang of love lost and friendship restored, his appropriate role became obvious. He is avant-garde pop's great sentimentalist, relaying simple truths through lovely melodies. As corny as it makes him seem sometimes, it's an honorable position.

In these adaptations the director has a legacy of bright titles from the stage, and the story runs along with increasing interest until the climax is reached. There is hardly a better example of filming a play than \\"The Bad Man,\\" which is being presented this week at the Strand. It is especially interesting because Holbrook Blinn plays the title rôle","excerpt":"as he did on the stage.\\"The Bad Man\\" provokes a constant chuckle. None of the whimsical humor with which Porter Emerson Browne, author of the play, surrounded the chief character has been lost. Blinn seems to take the same Keen enjoyment in playing the part for the screen as he did before the footlights. His is a lesson for motion picture players, for he is never at a loss for a smirk, a smile, a look of surprise, threatening gestures, or interest in what is going on around him. Blinn's hands and feet appear to suit the very expression of his darkened countenance.When he coolly informs Morgan Pell (Walter McGrail) that he is going to kill him to make two people happy, and then leans back on a table, studying the villain, finally mumbling to his chief lieutenant: \\"Pedro, I do not hunt rabbits—you keel heom,\\" Blinn is perfect. And so he is at the end when, after bidding the happy widow farewell, he casually informs everybody that he thanks them for having given him one of the most peaceful days he has ever had.The man termed a loan shark, who is insistent on foreclosing on the ranch, is alluded to by the Bad Man as a \\"loanfish.\\"Before slaying the villain he asks: \\"Tell me, Mr. Loan-Fish, does the widow in your country get the money of her husband?\\"Harry Myers, who was in \\"A Connecticut Yankee at the Court of King Arthur,\\" and more recently in \\"The Brass Bottle,\\" is most amusing as Red Giddings, who at all times chews gum and dotes on playing his mouth organ. His farcial actions fit in well with this photoplay.Charles A. Sellon portrays Uncle Henry in the wheel chair. Uncle Henry is an old busybody who is able to get almost everywhere anybody can walk with his wheel chair, and the speed with which he can turn adds to the comedy in this story. One minute he is out on the porch, and then by a swift movement to the wheels of this wonderful chair he steers straight for the midst of the little group inside the shack. When the Bad Man announces that he is going to ask questions of everybody and that the first man to tell a lie will be killed, Uncle Henry chirps in with: \\"I hope he tells the first lie,\\" nodding to the loan shark.Jack Mulhall has the part of Gilbert Jones, the hero. It is a sad contrast between the two actors when he and Blinn have the centre of the stage. Mulhall may be an average motion picture player, but his acting can't stand comparison at close quarters with such a brilliant actor as Blinn.Edwin Carewe, the director of \\"The Bad Man,\\" deserves great praise for the clever and restrained manner in which he has handled this splendid production. It is a picture which sends one away joking about the lingo of the Bad Man.

Davis (1892-1964) incorporated this country's commercial icons into modern painting (anticipating Pop Art) in works like \\"Lucky Strike\\" (1921), and rewrote Cubism as a syncopated New World symphony, jazzing it up and making hot colors and hard-edged forms dance on a shallow stage. \\"The amazing continuity\\" is his own phrase: it appears as a slogan blazoned in black letters on the 1951 painting \\"Visa.\\" Lewis Kachur points out that for Davis, the line separating writing, drawing and painting was quite thin. Unfortunately, so are the essays in THE DRAWINGS OF STUART DAVIS: The Amazing Continuity (American Federation of Arts/Abrams, $45), by Mr. Kachur and Ms. Wilkin, who are the curators of the touring exhibition, organized by the American Federation of Arts, for which this volume is the catalogue. While providing basic information and suggestive ideas, neither Ms. Wilkin nor Mr. Kachur extensively discusses the artist's execution or the conceptual, artistic and social implications of the drawings with the rigor they deserve.

Daniels, would be leaving the organization when his contract expires in June.   A statement released by the theater said Mr. Daniels, who has been the managerial and administrative head of Playwrights Horizons since 1981, was leaving \\"to pursue other opportunities.\\"   Neither Mr. Daniels nor the chairman of the board of trustees, Judith O. Rubin, returned phone messages this week. But the artistic director of Playwrights, Don Scardino, said in a careful phone interview that the move signaled a shakeup in the organization's two-pronged management structure. It was a year ago that Mr. Scardino, an actor and director in theater and film, replaced Andre Bishop, who had moved on to become artistic director at Lincoln Center Theater. Together, Mr. Bishop and Mr. Daniels had established a leadership team that apparently foundered after Mr. Bishop's departure. (Mr. Bishop, who remains a member of the Playwrights board, declined to comment on the matter, pleading awkwardness.)   Mr. Scardino said the search for Mr. Daniels's replacement had begun, but he added that two people might be hired: an executive director with fund-raising responsibility and a company manager whose bailiwick would be the administrative end of the theater's stage productions.    \\"One of the things in question is whether the two-headed team is the best structure for us or not,\\" Mr. Scardino said. \\"I'm very much a group person. I'm a director who comes out of the rehearsal hall. I like a group dynamic and I'm not insecure about having someone disagree with me. One of the reasons I want to investigate the triumvirate is that you always have a tiebreaker.\\"   It was already a somewhat tumultuous year at Playwrights Horizons, a 22-year-old group with two small theaters on West 42d Street that is dedicated to the development of new American plays and musicals. Mr. Scardino brought in a new associate artistic director, Nicholas Martin","excerpt":"as head of the board, Ms. Rubin is a recent replacement for Anne G. Wilder, who died in September.    Mr. Scardino's first year has been without any successes equal to the many renowned projects that have been born there in the past, including \\"Driving Miss Daisy,\\" and \\"Sunday in the Park With George.\\" It is, of course, early in his tenure, and he said the dismissal of JoAnne Akalaitis by the New York Shakespeare Festival board after only 20 months was baffling and troubling. \\"She's not Joe Papp, and I'm not Andre Bishop,\\" he said. \\"How many years did it take for them to establish their identities?\\"   In considering Mr. Daniels's departure, his own board, he said, had \\"decided to let it happen and go with the art.\\" He said he did not find the Shakespeare Festival situation comparable to that at Playwrights Horizons because \\"one was about artistic change, and the other is about managerial change.\\"   Asked if he and Mr. Daniels had clashed, Mr. Scardino said: \\"There's a different sensibility guiding the company,\\" and compared himself to a person who inherits someone else's wardrobe. \\"This color was good for him,\\" he said. \\"This length was good for him. I'll wear it for a while, but eventually I've got to take it in. I like the suit, but I want it in blue.\\" Speak No Evil    Unable to save \\"Face Value,\\" the producers simply saved face by declining to speak with reporters this week. (A man sounding a lot like Stuart Ostrow answered the phone at Mr. Ostrow's home, saying \\"He'll have to get back to you\\" and hanging up without waiting for the number.) David Henry Hwang's play about confused racial identities, which closed Sunday after a critically bruising tryout in Boston and eight previews at the Cort Theater, apparently never overcame a perception that the show was trying to do too much and ended up doing too little. Reviewers (and a sampling of the few other people who saw it) tended to say they couldn't tell if the show was a farce that wasn't funny or a serious play with too many goofy jokes.   Indeed, one source who was aware of the play's problems in Boston said that Rocco Landesman, a co-producer and president of Jujamcyn Theaters, had tried to persuade his colleagues, Mr. Ostrow and Scott Rudin, to close the show before it got here. Mr. Rudin and Mr. Ostrow said at the time, however, that they were undaunted, buoyed by the knowledge that Mr. Hwang's previous play, \\"M. Butterfly,\\" which became a Tony-winning hit, was also clobbered out of town. And Mr. Hwang (who, through the show's publicity agent, also declined to be interviewed) spent his days rewriting furiously, with the play changing nightly. One viewer who saw it in both cities said: \\"In Boston, the first act was funny, and the second act was too serious.\\" In New York, he added, they tried to prepare the audience for what was going to happen in the second act, and as a result the first act wasn't funny anymore.   From the point of view of a reporter who didn't see the play at all, the person who comes out of this best is the star, Mark Linn Baker. Mr. Baker, now an out-of-work actor possessed, apparently, of comic humility, donned a waiter's apron to introduce himself during one lunch hour at the West Bank Cafe on 42d Street this week. (It turns out he's part owner of the place.)   \\"My understanding is they just ran out of money,\\" Mr. Baker said. \\"It was such an ambitious play. We knew before we started in Boston we had a lot of work to do.\\"   He said there had been a celebratory wake, of sorts, for the show on Tuesday night at Wally and Joseph's, the steakhouse on West 49th Street. But he hadn't had a steak.   \\"I was drinking kamikazes,\\" he said. An 'Arf' for Off Broadway?    The corpse is twitching, though as Charles Strouse would rather put it, \\"the body is breathing.\\" Mr. Strouse, who wrote the music for the apparently ill-fated and moribund sequel \\"Annie Warbucks,\\" confirmed this week that many producers had come forward with an interest in resuscitating the show, the scheduled Broadway production of which was, pardon the expression, orphaned when it was shut down three weeks ago.   \\"There are people who know there is money to be made on this,\\" Mr. Strouse said. \\"Even the stingiest investor knows there was profit of $300 million on 'Annie.' \\"   Interestingly enough, among the offers is one to present the show Off Broadway. Though he refuses to acknowledge it publicly, Ben Sprecher, who operates the Variety Arts theater on Third Avenue and 14th Street, has been approaching investors with a proposal to open the show there. The Variety Arts, a 499-seat venue, is Off Broadway's most capacious theater.   \\"I've been approached to produce 'Annie Warbucks' Off-Broadway,\\" said Kenneth D. Greenblatt (\\"Catskills on Broadway\\"), adding it was Mr. Sprecher who did the approaching. \\"It's under consideration. I like the project. Creatively I think it's wonderful. I'm just concerned about doing it Off Broadway for financial reasons.\\"   Mr. Strouse said he'd definitely be interested. \\"A way to get into the New York marketplace is something I want very much,\\" he said.   Mr. Sprecher, when asked about his plans, said, \\"I don't know what you're talking about.\\" On Stage, and Off"},{"year":"1927","title":"Glass, C, An Adventure in Constructive Finance Political Paternity of the Federal Reserve Law","excerpt":"As Head of the Committee That Framed the Act, Senator Glass Tells The Story of Wilson's Fight for the Historic Measure"},{"year":"1930","title":"WASHINGTON, April 1 (AP).--As head of the first family of the land, President Hoover expects to answer the questions of the census taker tomorrow.

This pigment, which the liver turns into vitamin A, is why carrots and cantaloupes are good for you -- and why they are orange. So Philipp Simon, who breeds plants at a U.S.D.A. lab in Madison, Wis., and John Navazio, a plant geneticist, have added  it to cucumbers.

For most of the time since then they have managed to stay together as a unit -- primarily a quintet -- growing together musically and as performers while they continued to work in their basic musical style.   At Fat Tuesday's (190 Third Avenue, at 17th Street), where the quintet is playing through Sunday, it includes three of the original New Englanders: Mr. Hamilton, who plays tenor saxophone, Chris Flory, a brilliantly swinging guitarist who has found his own adaptation of the playing of Charlie Christian, and Chuck Riggs, a drummer who maintains a strong, steady beat through a variety of colors and shadings. The quintet also has two New York additions: the pianist John Bunch, who joined the group eight years ago, and Dennis Irwin, who replaced the original bassist, Phil Flanigan, this year.   The quintet is now a relaxed, confident and highly polished group with a personality of its own, developed from its individual members, although the sources can still be distinguished. And its material, which has been extended to include the 1950's with such tunes as \\" 'Round Midnight\\" and \\"Bernie's Tune,\\" is very much their own choice.   The first set on Tuesday, for example, included a pair of rarely heard Duke Ellington tunes, \\"The Feeling of Jazz\\" and \\"Tonight I Shall Sleep.\\" The latter provided a setting for a gorgeous solo by Mr. Hamilton in which the Ellingtonian sounds of Johnny Hodges and Ben Webster were almost casual elements of Mr. Hamilton's personal development of the tune. The musical excitement of this quintet comes not only from the performances themselves but also from the skill and imagination of the group's creative extension of the mainstream style in which it works.

Someday Harold Robbins is going to wash his mouth out with soap and call it quits, but until then, here comes ''The Storyteller,'' his 19th novel. There are 10 things you need to know before you purchase or don't purchase it, according to your custom. (1) It is possibly autobiographical, at least in part, because when the hero, Joe Crown, an aspiring novelist, is asked what he expects from his career, he replies, ''I want money.'' (2) Most of the words in the book have only one or two syllables (and four or five letters), but in the case of adverbs Mr. Robbins will stretch it to seven syllables or even eight (''unenthusiastically''). (3) The book boasts some hilarious lines, such as ''A good pimp has to be born, not taught.'' (4) This is an adult book in the sense that for plenitude and monotony of sex scenes it could be stocked wherever ''Adult Books'' are sold. (5) As Joe Crown travels from the Brooklyn of 1942 to Hollywood to Europe and the top of his profession -buying his way out of the draft, managing a high-class West Side bordello, climbing in and out of beds and bathtubs, writing in spare moments - he meets few women but many ''girls.'' (6) The only honor observed in the tale is among racketeers. (7) Mr. Robbins's women - well, girls - get slapped around plenty","excerpt":"as Joe explains, ''She probably wanted it.'' (8) Facts are treated cavalierly - in 1949, Audrey Hepburn was not an American movie star, nor were Sophia Loren and Carlo Ponti gossip column fodder. (9) Lesbians abound, but there are no male homosexuals. (10) A more appropriate title, since there isn't much in the way of storytelling, might be ''The Draft Dodger,'' ''The Pimp'' or ''The Best-Selling Author.''

Norquist of Milwaukee withdrew an eight-day-old advisory that had urged citizens to boil water for drinking and washing food. He said the city's water was finally free of the microscopic parasites called cryptosporidia, which live in the intestines of cattle. The spring run-off had brought an unusually large amount of animal waste into Lake Michigan, which provides the city's water supply.

Since it was signed by President George Bush on July 26, 1990, the law has been taking effect gradually in bus transportation, employment and training, public accommodation and telecommunications. The usual estimate given for the number of disabled in the United States is 43 million. The Office of Technology Assessment of Congress estimates that in 1990, 1.4 million people used wheelchairs, 1.7 million used walkers and 3 million one or more \\"mobility technology devices,\\" not counting canes and braces.  Lifts Called Crucial    The managers at the workshop represented the part of the travel industry that was given the longest time to comply with the law -- private-bus operators. The requirement considered the biggest burden by bus operators, that they buy only lift-equipped buses, does not take effect until 1996 and 1997.    While current rules require boarding assistance and storage of wheelchairs aboard the bus -- help that allows those with some mobility to take a bus trip -- most wheelchair-users consider lifts crucial. Lifts, they say, are essential to those with no mobility and they permit passengers to sit in their own chairs or scooters, and thus to travel autonomously. But few private bus companies are leaping ahead on this. The only nationwide intercity company, Greyhound, has no lift-equipped buses among the 1,850 in its active fleet. The American Bus Association says seven companies among its 600 members have lift-equipped long-distance buses.    Part of the reason for this inaction is that the laws do not go into effect for a long time, a delay that was allowed by Congress on the ground that private long-distance bus companies were in bad financial shape. \\"Congress did not do you any favors,\\" Mr. Isaacs told the bus managers, because final specifications for private companies' wheelchair-accessible long-distance buses have not yet been written. Mr. Isaacs, who has been in the transportation field for 16 years, and who was involved in the passage of the disabilities law, said that those who bought or refitted buses before seeing the regulations, which are due in draft form next year, might have bought something inadequate. He said, however, that an interim report already released by the Office of Technology Assessment probably could be read as a outline for the regulations.    Public transit systems were affected by the law immediately","excerpt":"as of August 1990, a month after the law was enacted, public systems could only buy or lease buses with anchors for wheelchairs and wheelchair boarding lifts, or devices at the bus stop for boarding wheelchairs. Since municipal buses usually remain in use for 12 years or so, the 1990 start of the law means that by 2002 all public buses will probably be lift-equipped. There were no retrofitting requirements in this law; an earlier law requiring retrofitting had been found unconstitutional. Some city systems, notably Denver's, were already putting lift-equipped long-distance buses into use when the disabilities law was enacted. New York City also started early making its buses lift-equipped, having been sued in 1979 by James J. Weisman of the Eastern Paralyzed Veterans Association. Mr. Weisman says that New York City Transit Authority buses are virtually 100 percent lift-equipped now.    New Jersey Transit, a public agency, has 1,921 buses and 514 of these are lift-equipped. None of its long-distance buses have lifts because none have been bought since 1987, said Armando Arrastia, a spokesman.    By contrast, private bus companies will not be required to buy or lease lift-equipped buses until 1996, if they are large companies, and until 1997 if they are small. What constitutes large companies and small companies will be specified in the law. Long-distance, or over-the-road buses, defined in the law as buses with an elevated passenger deck over the luggage compartment, do not need to be replaced for as many as 20 years, their owners say, meaning that United States intercity buses may not be all lift-equipped until 2017.  No One Is Suing    Enforcement of the disabilities law is done through lawsuits. For example, in the first 11 months that the employment sections of the act were in effect -- from July 1992 to June 1993 -- 11,760 complaints of employment discrimination were brought. The successful plantiffs won $11 million.   In sharp contrast, there have been no court complaints against private bus companies since the bus regulations began to come into effect, in 1991. This does not mean everything is satisfactory to advocates for the disabled. One reason they do not sue is that the delay in implementing the law provides narrow grounds.    Under the rules now in effect, bus companies must help people who have some mobility get onto the bus and must transport their wheelchairs; the rules also require that the deaf and blind, as well as others defined as disabled, be accommodated.    Mr. Isaacs also explained that while lawsuits brought under the new act can result in court injunctions, individual plaintiffs cannot collect for damages, as they can in employment cases. A bus company is required to pay penalties only if the suit is joined by the Department of Justice. Moreover, Mr. Isaacs said to his audience of bus company officials, \\"I don't know anyone in a wheelchair who wants to undergo a trip with you to sue you.\\"    The bus regulations, current and future, are complex because not only are they different for public and private companies, but they are also different for companies with schedules and those that provide service on request, and companies that are mainly involved in providing transportation and those that provide transportation as part of some other business, such as motels that pick up customers in vans at airports.   So far, 128 companies out of the 600 that belong to the American Bus Association have signed up for or have attended one of the 10 seminars nationwide. Mr. Isaacs believes attendance signifies interest, rather than a wish to learn how to evade the law. He said that the competitive marketplace might even push companies ahead of the law. Few Services Volunteered    But rare is the company owning a lift bus that is not required to do so. The participants in the seminar described meeting customers' needs by sending vans, or taking passengers by taxi to a bus station where a platform or a ramp is available.   Bill Kula, a spokesman for Greyhound, said that despite his company's lack of wheelchair-lift buses, \\"We are in compliance.\\" With 24 hours' notice, he said, his company \\"can meet the vast majority of requests.\\" Greyhound's \\"helping hands\\" policy, Mr. Kula said, allows a companion of a disabled person to travel free to provide help at stops.    Tauck Tours, a bus-tour operator in Westport, Conn., that owns no buses but leases them from other companies, has about 200 buses in use at a peak season, according to a spokesman, Phil Otterson. They all \\"lean\\" or \\"kneel,\\" but none has a lift. \\"We are fulfilling our obligations by providing boarding assistance,\\" he said.    The Peter Pan Bus Company of Springfield, Mass., one of the seven companies with lift buses, owns 175 long-distance buses, 9 of them lift-equipped, according to a vice president, Bob Schwarz. A Massachusetts subsidy plan helped the company buy them, Mr. Schwarz said.   Despite the paucity of companies like Peter Pan that have lift buses, Mr. Weisman of Eastern Paralyzed Veterans remains optimistic. \\"People are beginning to realize that inaccessibility is stupid,\\" he said.

Compleat anglers as well as people who never go near the water are indulging a passion for acquiring these sprightly little objects, says to Alan Liu, author of \\"The American Sporting Collector's Handbook,\\" published in 1976 by Winchester Press and revised in 1981. He will give a free talk on the subject Tuesday at 7:30 P.M. at the Fox Lane Middle School, on Route 172 in Mount Kisco.    \\"There was no market for this three or four years ago,\\" said Mr. Liu, who suggested one reason for the surge in popularity was that fishing flies were relatively cheap. Prices range from $25 to $250 at the entry level to collecting","excerpt":"as one approaches connoisseurship, prices reach $750 to $1,000.    For the last few years there have been sufficient devotees to inspire an annual dinner and show at the Rye Town Hilton each March, sponsored by the Theodore Gordon Fly Fishers, a nonprofit environmental organization based in Manhattan. Mr. Liu regards Theodore Gordon as the father of American fly-fishing. \\"When he died 50 years ago, his flies were saved by friends -- keepers of the flame,\\" Mr. Liu said. \\"He was a bachelor with no family to carry on the tradition.\\"    Gordon flies represent the upscale side of collecting, selling for as much as $10,000. While some vintage flies are in the used category, most have never been sullied by a trout's innards.    Determining the authenticity of a Gordon fly is done by the signature, said Mr. Liu, \\"like recognizing the brush strokes and colors of a painting.\\" Quality of materials, the angle of the feathers, the hooks -- all identify the maker, many of whom are women attracted to fly-tying as an art.    Antique flies can be spotted by hooks that are no longer made, or by feathers from rare birds, which are available only on a black market. \\"Indian crow, toucan, bustard and heron feathers were used during the golden age of fly-tying in Victorian England but they are illegal now,\\" said Mr. Liu.    His talk will be part of the monthly meeting of the Croton Watershed Chapter of Trout Unlimited, a conservation organization. Call 666-5727 for more information. A STONY POINT ARTIST     Page Simon, a Stony Point artist whose work goes on display today at the Hopper House Art Center in Nyack, comes from a talented family, but she is its only visual artist. (Her cousins, Carly, Lucy and Joanna Simon, have achieved fame in the music world while her father, Henry Simon, was the book editor of the PM newspaper.)    The major portion of this exhibition is devoted to Ms. Simon's semi-abstractions of natural and figurative forms. The brightly colored pencil drawings on highly textured paper are sometimes embellished with watercolors. Another group features color studies of the female nude, and a third section is composed of computer-generated images, a field in which Ms. Simon has worked and taught for several years.    The gallery, at 82 North Broadway, is open weekends from 1 to 5 P.M. A public reception will be held for the artist from 1 to 5 P.M. today. Admission is by donation of $1. Call 358-0774 for more information. CREDIBLE EDIBLES     Leftover carrot tops, ginger roots and avocado seeds are the components of a \\"Garbage Gardening\\" workshop for five- and six-year-olds at the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx on Saturday.    From 10 A.M. to noon the children will learn how to propogate humble kitchen scraps into credible edibles, by planting them in little greenhouses made of cardboard, plastic and florist's wire. The children will take their miniature gardens home to nurture into maturity, along with appropriate instructions.    A second workshop, for children 7 to 10 years old, will be held on March 9 from 10 A.M. to noon. Children meet in the Greenschool of the Enid A. Haupt Conservatory. The fee for either session is $12, and reservations must be made by calling 212-220-8982. A NEW AGENDA     Richard N.

Accompanying his performance on accoustic guitar, keyboard and synthesizer will be Rob Leon on bass and Peter O'Brien on drums. The cafe is located at on Route 22 and admission is $15. Call 855-1300 for reservations or more information. A GREBU RETROSPECTIVE     Once seen, the paintings of Devis Grebu are not easily forgotten. The Romanian native, who is now a county resident, has perfected his formula of scattering comic, folksy images across a surreal world, while making a rational statement about a particular issue affecting the planet. The viewer looks, then looks again with expanding curiosity into the context, the technique and the impishness of the artist.   In 1989, Rizzoli published an elegant collection of his cartoons, paintings and illustrations, \\"Devis Grebu: Through an Artist's Eye\\" ($37.50). Now a retrospective exhibition of Mr. Grebu's output can be seen at the White Plains Library Gallery, at 100 Martine Avenue, through March 3. Gallery hours are Monday through Thursday from 9 A.M. to 9 P.M.; Friday from 9 A.M. to 6 P.M.; Saturday from 9 A.M. to 5 P.M. and Sunday from 1 to 5 P.M. SEE THE WOODPECKERS     A tour of the \\"Woodpeckers of Westchester\\" exhibition, plus a walk along the Greenburgh Nature Center trails to view woodpeckers in the wild, begins at 10 A.M. on Saturday. The center is located on Dromore Road off Central Avenue.    The exhibition consists of dioramas, charts, maps, graphics and live birds and will remain on display through April 21. It focuses on the woodpecker's unique abilities as a carpenter and its diet of insects, which serves as a protection for trees, houses and the occasional picnic. A number of sub-species are highlighted: the flickers, pileateds, sap-suckers, downy, red-headed and red-bellied, for example.     An exhibition of related paintings, prints and photographs is also on view. Admission is $2. Call 723-3470 for more information.

For all of what Bush Administration officials describe as their foreign policy successes elsewhere, the concede that they are leaving Mr. Clinton with an overarching problem in Asia: a Japan policy that is in disarray, with few fresh ideas about how to deal with America's biggest economic competitor.    The trade deficit, after declining temporarily, is almost at record levels -- nearly $50 billion in 1992. With Japan in the midst of one of its steepest economic declines in years, the chances for a boost in imports of American goods this year are virtually nil. And the Japanese fear a backlash that will lead to unilateral American action to restrict Japanese imports, poisoning early relations with the new Administration.

The canvas was much too broad and turgid, the details too numerous and complex. Yet apparently the Mexican director, Miguel Contreras Torres, has thought it worth a try, and in his Mexican-made, Spanish-language picture, \\"The Life of Simon Bolivar,\\" which was presented last night at the Belmont, he has turned out an over-sized film which patiently chronicles the exploits of Bolivar with the fidelity of a history book.To regard it as anything other than a cinematic pageant of a man's life is completely out of the question. That is obviously what it was intended to be, and any one who looks for plotted drama in it will look long and in vain. Originally the picture ran something over four hours","excerpt":"as shown here it runs two and a half. And in that time it takes up the many details of Bolivar's life, from his marriage to Maria Teresa Toro in 1801 to his sad and lingering demise in the Colombia republic in 1830.In between, it recounts his earliest ventures to free his native Venezuela from Spain, his battles of liberation against the royalists and then against the llaneros (the local riff-raff armies led by bandits and opportunists). It parades his endless battles, victories and defeats, all of them looking very similar. It shows his famous march across the Andes to Bogota in 1819 to free and establish Greater Colombia. It details his efforts to liberate Ecuador and Peru, his meeting with San Martin—and it is full of many patriotic spiels.Julian Soler looks surprisingly like the pictures of Bolivar, and he plays the famous revolutionary with stiff and solemn dignity. In fact, most of the actors perform in a fustian style which gives to the film a pomposity that it can little afford. Some of the scenes, such as the crossing of the Andes, are picturesque, and occasionally a detail stands out with dramatic vividness, one being the scene of the torturing of victims by the bandit Boves. But, in the main, \\"The Life of Simon Bolivar\\" is an interminably long and repetitious film, uneven (because of cutting) and lacking dramatic drive.

Grove Press, $13.    This first novel explores the love affair between two Caribbean-born women on an unnamed island: a sugar-cane worker and an educated expatriate who returns from Canada to take part in a political revolution. The tale is ''passionate in its attention to emotional nuance and visual detail,'' Catherine Bush wrote here in 1998.    Working With Emotional Intelligence   By Daniel Goleman. Bantam, $15.95.

Unfortunately, there is nothing to confound this belief in the motion picture of the same title that arrived at the Paramount yesterday.Irwin Allen, the producer, director and co-writer of the movie, has faced up gamely to his towering challenge and gone down fighting on practically every count. The result is a protracted and tedious lesson in history that is lacking in punch, sophistication and a consistent point of view.As we say, it is not that Mr. Allen has stinted in any respect. As the cast list above indicates, he has assembled a battery of \\"name\\" actors to play the many famous figures that fumble their way through this charade. And he has given them handsome sets to move through and tasteful costumes to wear, and has lighted the whole business pleasantly for the color cameras.But he has not succeeded in dramatizing what is essentially a disconnected pageant that ranges over every known period of history. True, he has tried to do this through the device of a court that is sitting in judgment on man somewhere in outer space as the moment of nuclear war approaches on the planet earth.So the case is argued, with Vincent Price, playing the devil, insisting that man is evil and deserves to be wiped out. On the opposite side of the question is The Spirit of Man, embodied in Ronald Colman. A score of key moments in history are rung in as evidence for their cases, beginning with man's discovery of fire and ending with, let's see now, some color film of World War II.That's another thing","excerpt":"as the film wears on, it depends more and more on what appears to be color footage from old Warner Brothers movies, showing battle scenes from various periods of history.But the main trouble is that the debate as to the moral tendency of man—for good or evil—introduces every conceivable cliché.

Mr. Peterson, above, was a prodigy in Montreal in the 1940's. By the early 50's he had won the support of the producer Norman Granz, whose Jazz at the Philharmonic franchise had the power to make a career","excerpt":"as the virtual house pianist for Granz's various record labels, including Verve, Mr. Peterson accompanied Billie Holiday as well as Ella Fitzgerald. But his greater achievement was a trio that featured the bassist Ray Brown with, successively, the guitarist Herb Ellis (for five prolific years) and the drummer Ed Thigpen (for the next seven). In both trio iterations, and in subsequent groups, Mr. Peterson combined dazzling technique with effervescent swing; none of his contemporaries played with more velocity and volubility. In the midst of a career resurgence in the early-90's, Mr. Peterson suffered a stroke, losing strength in his left hand. He has since developed a compensatory style, less effusive but still appealing. He has also developed a contemplative streak, as evidenced by an autobiography (''Jazz Odyssey: The Life of Oscar Peterson,'' published in 2002 by Continuum) and his most recent album (''Trail of Dreams: A Canadian Suite,'' released in 2000 on Telarc). Mr. Peterson comes to Birdland next week with a good working band -- Ulf Wakenius on guitar, David Young on bass and Alvin Queen on drums -- and an occasion to celebrate: He turned 81 this week.

Prerequisites for becoming members are a good voice, an ability to sing in tune and a musical ear.
