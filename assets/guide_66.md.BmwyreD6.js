There are enough in one day's offerings to save shoppers more than $12 on breakfast cereals from General Mills and Kellogg. The recent costly marketing battles between the largest ready-to-eat cereal makers, while good for consumers, have taken some snap and crackle out of several analysts' views on the stocks.    \\"The competition clearly has intensified,\\" said John M. McMillin, an analyst with Prudential Securities in New York, who is advising investors to hold the cereal stocks. One reason is the drag on earnings from the costly marketing battles. They added $100 million, a 25 percent increase, to Kellogg's selling and administrative expenses in the third quarter.

I can't think about it. I'm involved with the private image.''   Someone who specialized in graphics was often thought to be more of a craftsman than an artist, and more concerned with propaganda than with art. However, in the 25 years since Kline made that statement, artists' attitudes toward printmaking have undergone considerable revision.   There is now a growing number of privately owned presses. Also, there are numerous workshops producing fine-art editions for artists who are not skilled in graphic techniques, or who lack their own equipment, but who nevertheless want to explore the print's potential, exploit its unique qualities and cater to a growing market among knowledgeable and serious but less affluent collectors.

And accompanying greater awareness is a growth in the number of tours designed for handicapped travelers.    Among new developments is the use on train platforms in France of a portable, battery-powered lifting device that raises wheelchairs to the car door in 20 seconds. The machine is available at 13 stations, including those in Paris, Lyons, Marseilles, Strasbourg and Lourdes, and about 100 other stations are to get it by the end of next year. Beginning June 3, handicapped passengers may reserve seats from an allotment in first and second class on certain French trains, and areas in first class on those trains will be set aside for wheelchair users, even if they are traveling on second-class tickets.

And post-punk ironists approach the blues with less reverence than did the baby boomers, dismantling the legacy instead of worshiping it. At CBGB's on Sunday night, two bands proved the genre's enduring lure, even as they ripped its elements to shreds.   The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion was more successful, because of the group's willingness to thoroughly challenge the music's norms. Mr.  Spencer, formerly of Pussy Galore, led his trio through a set of clanking musical pull-aparts grounded in the sleazy rhythms of 1960's garage punk. Looking like a Wall Street trader gone hopelessly awry, Mr. Spencer yelped and groaned and spat out cliched lyrics about rambling, being spooky and getting down. Each element of the Blues Explosions' songs fell away into separate strands, as did Mr. Spencer's vocals, which often dissolved into phonetic play. This chaos revealed the blues' bare bones, as if the genre's flesh had been blasted away.

In several respects, \\"Arturo Ui\\" is a challenge. The fact that it is less than a success is attributable to the play as well as to the revival at the CSC Repertory Theater.   Of all Brecht's works, this is one of the most problematic. Dramatically, it is outclassed by plays like \\"The Caucasian Chalk Circle\\" and \\"Mother Courage,\\" which, for good reason, are performed with greater frequency. Written in 1940 after the author had fled from Berlin to Finland, \\"Arturo Ui\\" was conceived in rage as a mordant parable about the still-rising Hitler. The play was not performed until 1958, after Brecht's death. The last previous New York presentation was on Broadway in 1963, in a production starring Christopher Plummer. The CSC is offering the New York premiere of Ralph Manheim's translation.

Do not expect \\"In the Jungle of Cities,\\" the first presentation of the New York Shakespeare Festival's post-Joseph Papp regime, to lighten the mood. In this bleak 1923 play, the 25-year-old Bertolt Brecht let loose with a young man's nihilistic howl of rage. Two men in a mythical Chicago -- a mysterious Malayan entrepreneur named Shlink and an idealistic young library worker named Garga -- conduct a \\"war of annihilation\\" that levels philosophies and people alike. For these bitter antagonists, even death leaves something to be desired.    The revival at the Public -- only the third major staging the play has received in New York -- is a co-production with Mabou Mines, the troupe that introduced Papp to his successor, JoAnne Akalaitis. As directed by Anne Bogart in a cerebral, fussy and static style, this tame \\"Jungle\\" seems less like the dawning of a new era than a throwback to the quaint bohemianism attending New York's Brecht craze of the late 1950's.
