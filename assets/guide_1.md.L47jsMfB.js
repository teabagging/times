Strange ideas are constantly popping up and they are supposed to be taken seriously. Mr. Tearle plays Hugh Somerton, an author who sneers at the fair sex in his books. Apparently he is so well known that he is impelled to take the name of Shaw when he visits a French watering place.This author has a wealthy friend named Colonel Jordan, who lends Somerton his yacht so that he can get away from those exasperating persons who are wont to ask him questions about his characters. From what the Colonel tells Somerton, he can have the vessel as long as he wishes and sail the seven seas.Ann Moore (Miss Stockfield) dislikes the mention of Somerton's name, but at the outset she has not met him. She happens to have lost all her funds in gambling and as a last resort she decides to ask Colonel Jordan to lend her money with which to pay her hotel bill. She goes aboard the yacht and waits for Jordan. The captain believes that Somerton knows about her presence, but it is not until the next morning at breakfast that she meets the individual masquerading as Shaw. It is not long afterward that this wise lass decides that Shaw is Somerton and she thinks that she will poke fun at his writings by behaving as his characters do.This leads to compromising situations and Somerton eventually decides to teach Ann a lesson. In doing so, however, he, as one might surmise, becomes a victim to her charms.There are some painful attempts at comedy as well as ludicrous incidents. Mr. Tearle accomplishes what is possible with his part and Miss Stockfield does fairly well by her characterization, although her enunciation is not always as clear as one might wish.

ALIX BROWNE The Remix","excerpt":"Beauty and The East"},{"year":"1930","title":"The versatile Victor Schertzinger, who composed the music for Maurice Chevalier's \\"Love Parade,\\" is the director of \\"The Laughing Lady,\\" an admirable pictorial adaptation of Alfred Sutro's play of the same title. The leading rôles are portrayed by those able players, Ruth Chatterton and Clive Brook, and most of the other performers have been selected with unusual sagacity.Judging by the reception of the picture by an audience at the Paramount yesterday afternoon, producers ought to be encouraged to make more such intelligent films. The subtlety in different passages was appreciated, as was also the comedy of the various incidents.Miss Chatterton looks more attractive than she has in any of her other films, and Mr. Brook's immaculate presence and pleasing enunciation help to make this one of the outstanding vocalized productions. It is in fact a most agreeable change to find a pictorial story that does not at some time or other swing off into a stream of extravagant artificiality or exasperating banality. It is a story that might almost happen and it is acted for the most part so naturally that one does not wish to turn one's eyes from the screen. The voices are modulated and there are no distressing hushed periods. It is so well done that it is deserving of applause from everybody.Bartlett Cormack and Arthur Richman are credited with the adaptation and they are to be congratulated on the rational lines put into the mouths of the characters. In fact, there is so much to be praised in this picture that one is wont to unloose superlative after superlative in an effort to discourage the many trivial affairs that have been set before the public.Here there is a woman who is given to smiling or laughing at fate. She is Mrs. Hector Lee, wife of a powerful banker. In an early episode, Mrs. Lee is rescued from drowning at Southampton, L. I., by a lifesaver, who is given to understand by his comrades that his heroic performance has engendered in Mrs. Lee a great admiration for him. Under the influence of gin he breaks into Mrs. Lee's boudoir, with the result that the blameless Mrs. Lee finds her picture with the lifeguard exploited in a tabloid paper.Her husband brings suit for divorce and prevails upon his lawyer, Daniel Farr (Mr. Brook), who is unaccustomed to such cases, to officiate as his attorney. Mr. Lee not only wins his divorce, but he receives custody of his little daughter Barbara. The society colony, one and all, begin to find an excuse for ostracizing Mrs. Lee, but this unfortunate woman, through intentionally not answering a telephone ring, goes to a party given by Mr. and Mrs. Playgate. Mr. Playgate is a trump, but his wife is fretful regarding entertaining Mrs. Lee. Mrs. Lee is good looking and becomingly attired and it is therefore no wonder that Mr. Farr, despite what has happened in court, is smitten with this laughing lady's charms.Mrs. Lee does not take the affair seriously—that is, not until she hears in the end that Mr. Farr has been to see her ex-husband and informed him that, ethics or no ethics of the legal profession, he will act as Mrs. Lee's counsel if Lee does not consent to give Mrs. Lee the custody of her daughter.In an effort to revenge herself on the handsome lawyer, Mrs. Lee manoeuvres so that he will find himself the victim of the tabloid paper. But when she hears that Mr. Farr has arranged for her to have the custody of Barbara, she is filled with regret. Mr. Farr shows himself equal to that emergency, and the editor of the tabloid paper, being only interested in scandal, betrays a strange news sense to conform with the denouement of the narrative.Raymond Walburn in an adroit performance succeeds in making Lee well disliked. Herbert Druce, on the other hand, makes Playgate an ingratiating individual. Marguerite St. John is interesting as the vacillating Mrs. Playgate. The newspaper reporter and photographer are, as usual, portrayed as exaggerated nuisances, but it is stressed that they are of the yellow journalism fraternity.Rudy Vallee and his band officiate in a stage affair known as \\"Streets of Bombay.\\" Mr. Vallee sings one song in which \\"sweeter than the sweet\\" are among the words and in which \\"wrecked\\" is rhymed with \\"effect.\\" There is also a jazzed conception of the tune of \\"Mandalay,\\" with dancing girls and dancing men, the rhythmic sounds of whose feet are quite effective.

In it is featured the graceful and comely Madge Bellamy, who prances through the scenes in a light-hearted and pleasing fashion. The title of this presentation has reference to those members of the fair sex who, in this story, look forward to their ailmony on their wedding day. The opening subtitle sets forth:\\"Marriage is responsible for divorce.\\"Then one perceives two bright and pretty stenographers in the office of a legal expert on divorce looking out of the window at a wedding across the street, and it is soon settled by reference to the files that the bride in question has just led her seventh catch to the altar. This astute young woman has also arranged it so that she is still enjoying alimony from her ex-husbands and has succeeded in winning a wealthier man every time she has consented to become a bride.Miss Bellamy impersonates the unsophisticated Nancy Woods. No matter what her employer's connections are, she actually believes in marrying for love, and yet she cannot help Lorna Estabrook pouring advice into her ear. Nancy's feminine friend is so keen on alimony that she warns Nancy before the girl is married, and it chances that Stockney Webb overhears everything that is told to Nancy. Naturally, he is in no happy frame of mind. Instead of going direct to the destination of their honeymoon, Webb decides to stop over at a hunting lodge, where Nancy has a rough time of it. But, as one might surmise with Miss Bellamy as the heroine and John Mack Brown as the hero, there is an understanding at the final fade-out without the suggestion of alimony ever passing their lips.Mr. Brown is eminently satisfactory as the good-looking young man who wants to marry for life. Olive Tell, Mary Duncan and Joyce Compton add to the gayety of the hour.Mr. Rothafel's stage contributions are agreeable to the eye and the ear. There are also some interesting Movietone numbers.

Jeffrey Dwyer, the Centaur of the story, is an irresponsible individual who finds that pretty feminine faces go to his head. After a careful study of his antics on the screen and realizing the utterly impossible situations, one concludes that this characterization is of a half cad and half fool.John Gilbert figures as Dwyer, whose avocation is supposed to writing poetry. Dwyer never appeals to one as a poet, and as one sees him frequently on the screen. It is obvious that his penchant for the fair sex leaves him little time to listen to the ladies from Parnassus.Mr. Gilbert gives a lively performance, but one is not impressed with his earnestness when uttering loving laudation to the different girls. He dives into a swimming pool fully clad because the girl to whom he is engaged is carrying on a flirtation with another man aboard a raft. And after his marriage he becomes infatuated again with Inez Martin (Aileen Pringle), but has a sudden change of heart and forthwith hastens back to his wife. This scene is a unique idea, accustomed as one is to thrills in motion pictures. Dwyer is in a lodge, after a skiing trip, having left a letter for his wife telling her of his intense love for Inez.When he decides that Joan, his wife, is a pattern to all women he dashes home on skis. These scenes, which show a man flying from high hills of untrodden snow and over brooks, are impressive, even if that were actually taken in Switzerland with a champion skidor performing before the camera. It is probable that Mr. Gilbert never saw so much as a flake of snow while this picture was being produced. However, the effect is quite good, except that Dwyer does not appear to be fatigued or out of breath after covering miles and miles of snow covered hills and mountains and making the most thrilling and daring leaps to reach home before Joan has a chance to read his letter. He winds up in a flourish before the camera, and then suddenly one sees the real Dwyer searching eagerly for the stupid missive.This picture is well produced and Eleanor Boardman and Aileen Pringle are charming in their respective rôles of heroine and vampire. There are many attractive scenes and the gowns of the female contingent are smart and graceful. Mr. Gilbert's characterization is superficial and lacking in subtlety.Doubtless this film will please many persons who want a light, frothy entertainment which never taxes the imagination. It is based on a novel by Cyril Hume, and we surmise many liberties have been taken in its transfer to the screen.

This position dismisses many of the valuable gains produced by the strategic arms negotiations.    As a graduate student at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy of Tufts University, I spent part of last summer in Geneva talking to members of the United States delegation to the strategic arms reduction talks for a thesis on arms control verification under the treaty. While it may indeed be desirable to reach an agreement on SS-18 and MX missiles, the absence of a provision for these weapons does not necessarily render the current negotiations obsolete. These negotiations will result in a treaty that reduces the nuclear arsenals of both sides, while also promoting stability.   Arms control treaties are complex agreements, which take years to conclude. As a result, it is unrealistic to expect any such treaty to reflect accurately every aspect of the political environment at the time it comes into effect.    As Mr. Nitze acknowledges, we cannot be certain that the political situation will remain as it is indefinitely. We should take advantage of the progress made by the negotiations to codify our relationship with the Soviets and provide a solid foundation upon which further negotiations can be built.   Any arms control agreement inevitably faces opposition from people who oppose arms control and from those who think that nothing short of the best arms control agreement is acceptable. It is the nature of a successful negotiation that compromises must be made","excerpt":"because of this, the perfect arms control agreement is easy to discuss, but much harder to negotiate.    Those who argue that the strategic arms reduction treaty that is under  negotiation does not go far enough should remember that they are also giving ammunition to those who are opposed to any arms control agreement, whether it is the best or otherwise.

But until it comes, he is \\"a prisoner, frantic with corporeality.\\" As he says: \\"I can't stay. I can't go,\\" and adds with curiosity, \\"Let's see what happens next.\\"   This prose piece, 13 terse chapters of a fiction, followed onstage by a coda extracted from the novel \\"How It Is,\\" is a distillation of the author's art and philosophy.
