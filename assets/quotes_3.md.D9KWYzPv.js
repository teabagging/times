Are there other areas of interest - to children aged 7 and 9 - nearby? - H. B., New York.      Answer:For visitors seeking color, the peak of bloom for the azaleas on Winterthur's 200 landscaped acres occurs in the first two weeks of May, but daffodils, dogwood and forsythia are in bloom in April along with many other plants. An official at Winterthur points out that the gardens are noted more for their greenness, their shaded walks and old trees than for their profusion of color.    Whatever the visitor's preference, the current ''Winterthur in Spring'' program, which continues through June 3, seems to offer a lot. The program includes a self-guided tour of the gardens","excerpt":"tours, with guide, of the 18 rooms in the museum known as the ''American Sampler Tour'' and 16 other rooms normally seen by reservation only; and an exhibition called ''Racing Regalia: Saratoga 1870- 1890.''

But Blue Nun, whose sales success in the 70's was a frequently waved feather in radio's cap, was indeed one of the topics that the bearded and bald Mr. Della Femina touched on as keynote speaker at the annual Association of National Advertisers-Radio Advertising Bureau Workshop yesterday at the Waldorf-Astoria.   He was taking the blame for allowing his clients at Schieffelin & Company, now a subsidiary of Moet-Hennessy, to forsake radio after 13 years of delightful Stiller and Meara commercials contributed to a growth in annual sales of from 43,000 to more than one million cases.    ''What we had failed to do as an agency was to convince a man that a campaign on radio that was working should continue to live,'' Mr.  Della Femina said. He recalled the client's argument: ''Yes, I know they're funny. Yes, I know that radio built this brand. But I want to be on television with dignified, 'important' commercials that will enable us to raise the price of the wine.''

A1    Easier North Korean Defections  The increasing ease with which people can buy their way out of North Korea suggests that the state's ability to control its citizens is diminishing, according to defectors and other experts on the subject.   A1    Japan assured Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice that it had no intention of pursuing a nuclear weapons program, despite North Korea's detonation of a nuclear device.   A14    Israel Finds Smuggling Tunnels  Israeli troops uncovered what they said were five smuggling tunnels as they advanced along the Gaza Strip's southern border with Egypt, and four Palestinians were killed in clashes, according to the Israeli military and Palestinian security officials.   A6    Sri Lankan Town Attacked  Powerful explosions rocked an important southern tourist town in Sri Lanka for the first time, apparently extending the war to a stronghold of the Sinhalese majority.   A3    Almost two years after a tsunami ravaged villages along the coast, a resurrection of violence in Sri Lanka's ethnic war has all but stopped foreign-financed reconstruction in some of the hardest hit areas.   A3    U.S. Complaint Kills Spain Deal  Spain's foreign minister said that a Spanish deal to sell military aircraft to Venezuela had been canceled because American government objections made it unfeasible.   A5    NATIONAL A16-24    Unlike the Democrats, G.O.P. Plays Down Iraq  With three weeks left until Election Day, Republican candidates are barely mentioning Iraq on the campaign trail and in their television advertisements. It is the Democrats who have seized on Iraq as a central election issue.  A1    As dozens of states are enforcing new voter registration laws and switching to paperless electronic voting systems, officials across the country are bracing for a chaotic Election Day with long lines, heightened confusion and an increase in the number of contested results.  A1    Arizona Crackdown Challenged  In a campaign to choke off payments to smugglers, the Arizona attorney general has periodically obtained warrants to seize money transferred by wire into Arizona from 29 other states. But the program has come under legal attack.  A24    According to a new report about immigrants' money transfers to Latin America, money flows from almost every state. Transfers from the United States to Latin America will total more than $45 billion.  A24    Ney's Office Remains Open  Representative Bob Ney is headed to prison early next year after pleading guilty to charges of accepting tens of thousands of dollars in illegal gifts from lobbyists, but his Congressional office is open for business.  A16    Making Amends at Brown  Extensively documenting Brown University's 18th-century ties to slavery, a university panel called for the institution to make amends by creating a center for the study of slavery and injustice and increasing efforts to recruit minorities.  A16    NEW YORK/REGION B1-9    Newark's Mayor Struggles With Unforseen Challenges  Cory A. Booker's dream of turning Newark into the paragon of American cities sounded good in campaign speeches, but after 100 days in office, the ambitious young mayor is starting to settle for a city that is a little less bruised, as he has come to find running New Jersey's largest city more challenging than he ever expected.  A1    Putting Off Kindergarten  Many New York parents are keeping their children out of kindergarten until they are nearly, or already, 6 years old believing the notion that an extra year of preschool builds a child's confidence and abilities. Yet research on whether the extra year helps is inconclusive.

The change has been taking place at the heart of the institution -- in the second- and third-floor galleries of painting and sculpture, which for years have depicted modern art as an evolution beginning with Cezanne and culminating heroically in Abstract Expressionism. That seamless interpretation, initiated by Alfred H. Barr Jr., founding director of the museum, and cultivated by William S. Rubin, former head of the department of painting and sculpture, unfolded as something authoritative and final. Pop artists, Minimalists and all those who worked in the 1960's and later tended to be relegated to temporary quarters in the galleries of contemporary art.   Now Kirk Varnedoe, Mr. Rubin's successor, is beginning to put his judicious imprint on the permanent collection. He is extending it chronologically: for the first time, artists like Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg and Andy Warhol have a prominence equal to that given Abstract Expressionists like Willem de Kooning and Barnett Newman.

It was built in 1842 as part of the Croton Aqueduct, which provided the city's first large and dependable source of fresh water. But it has been something of a civic embarrassment since 1984, when vandals set a fire that caved in its cupola, leaving the top of the tower squashed inward like a butted-out cigar.   Last week a new cupola, carved from granite, was hoisted by a crane to the top of the tower. The city's Department of Parks and Recreation spent $900,000 on the project. Unfortunately, while the department has restored the tower's striking exterior, it has no plans to open the interior, in which an ornate iron stairway circles to six landings, each with sweeping views of Manhattan and the Bronx.    \\"The tower is totally un-utilitarian, but magnificient to look at,\\" said Elisabeth Gotbaum, the city's Parks Commissioner.

Careers","excerpt":"Toxicology Is Found Neglected'"},{"year":"1991","title":"To the Editor:   In \\"Cows, Bulls and Clean Air\\" (advertisement, Op-Ed page, Dec. 13), the Mobil Corporation bemoans that Congress \\"hastily\\" passed a clean air bill that could cut into Mobil's profit margin and not improve air quality. The ad seems to credit Congress with good intentions, but suggests that intent led to a precipitous and imprudent result. Mobil's answer is more study and further delay. Let's examine the facts.   The Clean Air Act amendments of 1990 were the first revision of the act since 1977 and only the second in its 20 years. The bill was the most extensively debated legislation considered by the 101st Congress. It was the primary subject of Senate floor debate from January until April. The conference between the House and Senate lasted almost five months. The final conference bill received overwhelming bipartisan support in both houses.   Mobil suggests that Congress and the President should have waited until the petroleum industry could come up with its own answers to our air-quality problems. As early as 1977, the Environmental Protection Agency pointed out the staggering rise in the level of benzene and other toxic chemicals in gasoline as lead was replaced as an octane-enhancer by the aromatic compound known as BTX -- the collective name for benzene, toluene and xylene, all E.P.A.-listed toxic chemicals. In the last decade, these toxic components in gas increased more than 50 percent.   The E.P.A. says that more than 50 percent of the cancer deaths attributed to air pollution come from automobile exhaust. Gasoline has become so toxic that it can cripple a car's catalytic converter. Since 1970, cars have become as much as 96 percent cleaner. Yet gasoline is much more toxic.   How long does Mobil suggest Americans wait for reduction in the toxicity of motor vehicle emissions?   Mobil contends that the requirements of the Clean Air Act cannot be met. This conveniently ignores that one-quarter of the country's gasoline contains high-octane \\"oxygen,\\" either as ethanol or MTBE, a methanol derivative. If this oxygen were redirected to the markets that have air-quality problems, the supply demands would be met.   Moreover, there is idle and increasing capacity in the United States ethanol industry, and MTBE is the world's fastest growing chemical. According to Tenneco, a major methanol producer, a large-scale MTBE plant can be built in two years. World-scale facilities are under construction in the United States, Canada and abroad, and analysts predict that the global MTBE supply will double in four years.   Mobil questions that the Clean Air Act will improve air quality. The E.P.A. acknowledges, along with almost every reputable scientist that has looked into this, that the oxygenated fuels provisions of the Clean Air Act will have an immediate, significant impact on air quality. If we clean up gasoline, we don't have to wait for fleet turnover to breathe cleaner air.   What is Mobil's problem? Maybe it's that it has invested a lot of money in highly toxic gasoline. Or maybe it doesn't like the E.P.A. estimate that the fuel provisions of the Clean Air Act will displace more than 500,000 barrels of imported crude oil a day.   I suggest that Mobil join Amoco, Arco, Marathon and other petroleum companies that have started selling clean gas and contribute to the solution, not the cause, of our air quality problem.

Past recessions proved that parents will give up a lot of things before they will disappoint their children on Christmas.    Nonetheless, the stock market seems largely to be ignoring past trends and focusing more on bleak expectations for the economy and the evaporation of consumer confidence. A number of toy industry stocks are trading close to their 52-week lows.    And there are indeed some indications that this Christmas season may run counter to past trends. Cautious retailers, wary of being left with shelves of unbought goods, are keeping inventories low on all items, including toys. And fewer people are visiting shopping malls. \\"What the stocks are saying is, 'There might be somewhat more cyclicality here than meets the eye,' \\" said Steven Eisenberg, an analyst with Bear, Stearns & Company.     Analysts and toy company executives say that specific products, along with overall economic conditions, help to determine the health of the $13-billion-a-year industry. \\"A strong product trend can buck an economic trend,\\" Ms. French said.    Gary M. Jacobson, an analyst at Kidder, Peabody & Company, said the recession year of 1982 \\"was a great year for the toy industry.\\" He added, \\"Parents know what a slowdown is, but kids don't.\\"    B. J. French, a spokeswoman for the Tonka Corporation, agrees. \\"Even in the recession of the early 1980's,\\" she said, \\"toy sales seemed to go up.\\"    Nintendo continues to captivate toy buyers, andthe Japanese machines and their accompanying games, made under license by a number of companies, are again expected to be best sellers. Sales of electronic games are projected at $4 billion this year, more than 20 percent of all toy sales. Still, analysts say the video craze may finally be peaking, a result of boredom and saturation.   In any case, American toy makers largely missed the video boom. Mattel Inc., for instance, was preoccupied with financial problems several years ago and was unable to develop competitive video products. It has since found a way to take advantage of the craze with its Power Glove, which slips over a player's hand, replacing the stick control.    Hasbro Inc. spent millions of dollars developing Nemo, its own electronic video game, but never brought it out.    Going forward, any decline in video games' popularity should free a lot of dollars for other items, to the benefit of traditional toy makers like Hasbro and Mattel.   The Barbie doll by Mattel is experiencing strong sales, and large dolls are also selling well. \\"You are seeing emotional items doing better,\\" said Mr. Jacobson of Kidder, Peabody. Sales are strong again for Cabbage Patch dolls, which have belonged to Hasbro since it acquired Coleco Industries in 1989.    When it comes to individual toy stocks, a mixed picture exists. \\"I like the two big guys, and I'd avoid everything else,\\" Mr. Jacobson said, referring to Mattel and Hasbro.    Mattel, which has undergone a significant revamping in the last few years, is a favorite of analysts. Its stock price has nearly tripled in two years. Barbie accounted for about half of the company's 1989 sales of $1.23 billion, analysts say. Mattel's stock closed at $19.125 yesterday, down 12.5 cents on the New York Stock Exchange.    Analysts cite Hasbro as a model of diversification, which makes it less dependent on the hit products that typically drive the industry. Nonetheless, investors want the company to develop a substitute for its flagging G.I. Joe and Transformer lines. A share of Hasbro closed at $15 yesterday, up 75 cents on the American Stock Exchange.    Heavy debts or concerns about management have caused analysts to steer away from other companies. \\"Tonka is at a critical state,\\" Mr. Jacobson said, citing the company's indebtedness, a result of its 1987 acquisition of Kenner Parker.     Lewis Galoob Toys Inc., which makes miniature vehicles known as Micro Machines, is out of favor for its inability to develop a core line of products to sustain the company between hits.    In the short term, toy sales should benefit from changing demographics, Mr. Jacobson said, noting that last year there were nearly four million births in the United States, the most in 30 years. Plenty of money will be spent on these children of the baby-boom generation, he said, because there are more two-income households, more affluent grandparents, and more divorces, which often lead to each parent's spending heavily on toys.    But Mr. Jacobson also says that children are growing up faster and tend to quit playing with toys at a younger age. \\"Twenty years ago, 12-year-old kids played with dolls and cars,\\" he wrote in a recent report. \\"Today they are most likely interested in CD's, movies and the opposite sex.\\" Market Place","excerpt":"Toy Stocks Weak At Crucial Season"},{"year":"1996","title":"In the latest reversal in the seesaw legal battle over a proposed Toys 'R' Us store on Third Avenue at 80th Street, a judge has ruled in favor of the project.

The Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo produced an abridged \\"Nutcracker\\" in 1940 and the San Francisco Ballet offered the complete work in 1944.

In terms of games themselves, this year has not measured up to last year.     Some brilliant games have emerged, like Resident Evil 4, God of War and Jade Empire, but these have been interspersed with others that have not reached above pretty darn good. Still, some amazing games have turned up.    NINTENDOGS       For a while I thought Nintendo's double-screened DS hand-held device was destined to be a cute, pointless gimmick. I was proved wrong this summer. Game designers showed that the DS touch screen could heighten the game experience with such titles as Advance Wars: Dual Strike","excerpt":"Trace Memory; Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney; and, most notably, the puppy simulator Nintendogs. When I first heard of a game in which you raise dogs I thought it sounded dumb, but as those puppies squirmed happily as I petted the touch screen and sat when I shouted ''sit'' into the DS microphone, I was proved wrong once again. Easily the most adorable game of the year.     (Developed and published by Nintendo for Nintendo DS; $30; for all ages.)    GUILD WARS  An increasing number of multiplayer online role-playing games now exist in which a player wanders the countryside battling monsters, running errands and looking for better weapons and more powerful spells. And while I was almost as impressed with this year's City of Villains, it lost out in my heart to the deeper game play of Guild Wars. With an engaging battle system, gorgeous graphics and far more effective storytelling than is found in any other persistent-world game, Wars has become my all-time favorite in its class. It is also the perfect game for budget-conscious gamers; unlike the vast majority of such games, there is no monthly fee. If you are Donald Trump, saving $15 a month may not mean much, but I find it irresistible.     (Developed by ArenaNet and published by NCsoft for Windows 98/ME/2000/XP; $40; ages 13 and up.)    BURNOUT LEGENDS       The PlayStation Portable is the first hand-held console to nail racing games, and no game displays this better than Burnout Legends. The series' high-speed, crash-happy races are more exciting than anything else on the virtual road, so it is no surprise that Burnout Revenge is the best racing game of the year for the Xbox and PlayStation 2. What is amazing is that Legends brings the same intense, manic energy to something that fits in your pocket.      (Developed by Criterion and published by Electronic Arts; $50; for ages 10 and up.)    PHOENIX WRIGHT: ACE ATTORNEY       The most outrageous episodes of ''Ally McBeal'' exhibited a more faithful portrayal of the legal system than Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney does. In Phoenix Wright, perjury is treated as mildly inappropriate, and witnesses receive great leeway if they hand the judge a box lunch. But if this detective-adventure game gets every point of law wrong, it does get every aspect of game play right, with intelligent puzzles and wildly funny dialogue threaded through interrelated stories filled with improbable plot twists. It is fortunate that the game, my favorite of the year, comes with its own lawyer: anything this fun is bound to be illegal.     (Developed and published by Capcom for Nintendo DS; $30; for ages 13 and up.)    F.E.A.R.       A perfect combination of spooky chills and frenetic thrills, F.E.A.R. is everything you want in a first-person shooter, unless, that is, you want a plot that holds together. While the narrative is weak, the game moves the player assuredly through challenging firefights punctuated by ghostly scares. With a first-rate online multiplayer mode, F.E.A.R. is the most necessary shooter of the year. It's also a game that demands the most from your computer; you can buy it for $40, but if you want to play F.E.A.R. at maximum detail level, budget an extra $1,500 for a new computer.     (Developed by Monolith Productions and published by Vivendi Universal Games for Windows 2000/XP; $60 (DVD) or $40 (CD); for ages 17 and up.)    THE MOVIES       The Movies is two games bundled together. One is a terrific tycoon game where you take on the role of a Hollywood mogul, keeping your actors happy and producing award-winning films. The other is a moviemaking game that lets you create cinema scene by scene and upload the results to movies.lionhead.com. My favorite game-based movie so far is ''Scholastic Films: Intelligent Design,'' which hilariously outlines the evils of empirical reasoning. The game part of The Movies is about building a powerhouse studio, but for aspiring filmmakers the game is about something else entirely: getting your film listed as the most popular on the game's Web site.      (Developed by Lionhead Studios and published by Activision for Windows 98/ME/2000/XP; $60 (DVD) or $50 (CD); for ages 13 and up.)    GUITAR HERO       Guitar Hero may or may not be the greatest music game ever, but it is certainly the coolest. While Dance Dance Revolution has people frenetically stamping the floor, and Karaoke Revolution Party emulates the wacky joy of real karaoke, Guitar Hero has the player churning out grinding, wailing, crunchy guitar riffs. Sure, all you are really doing is pushing buttons on a plastic guitar peripheral, but play the game for a half-hour and you'll be so convinced you're Jimi Hendrix that when you go outside you'll wonder where your groupies went.     (Developed by Harmonix and published by RedOctane for PlayStation 2; $70 including guitar controller; for ages 13 and up.)    FIRE EMBLEM: THE SACRED STONES       The folks at Intelligent Systems have had a great year churning out extraordinary turn-based strategy games. Besides the standout Nintendo DS game Advance Wars: Dual Strike, they created two first-rate games in the Fire Emblem series, one for GameCube and one for Game Boy Advance. The strategy role-playing game Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones is the best Game Boy Advance title of the year. Soldiers' strengths and weaknesses are balanced beautifully. By throwing out the role-playing tradition that allows you to resuscitate fallen warriors, the game makes your every decision feel as if it's a matter of life and death. Intelligent Systems understands perfectly the nature of hand-held games: they are designed so you can stop playing at a moment's notice, but so compelling that you hate to do so.     (Developed by Intelligent Systems and published by Nintendo; $30; for all ages.)    BROTHERS IN ARMS: ROAD TO HILL 30       First-person shooters make battles immersive and chaotic; strategy games make the same battles cerebral exercises in planning. Some games try to do both, like the interesting Kingdom Under Fire: The Crusaders, but no game has done this quite as elegantly as Road to Hill 30. This game lets you crawl across the battlefield and fire on the enemy, but you can also zoom to a bird's-eye view of the battlefield, letting you map a strategy, which often involves having the rest of your squad pin down the enemy with gunfire while you sneak behind them. It's still to a great degree an intellectual exercise, but one with a visceral punch.     (Developed by Gearbox Software and published by Ubisoft for PlayStation 2, Xbox, Windows 2000/XP; sequel is $50, but the original has been marked down; for ages 17 and up.)    RESIDENT EVIL 4       Not many games can terrify players for an entire year, but the horror survival game Resident Evil 4 frightened GameCube owners in January and did the same for PlayStation 2 owners in October. The game is a radical departure from the series, retaining the creepy atmosphere but replacing shuffling zombies with spry, homicidal villagers and racing the player through wonderfully varied game play. Changes can be scary, but these turned out so well that they are the only thing in the game that won't give you a fright.     (Developed and published by Capcom; $40; for ages 17 and up.)
