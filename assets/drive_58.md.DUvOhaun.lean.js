Two days later, he was asking Maj. Robin Higgins, the wife of Col. William R. Higgins, a hostage who was apparently killed by his captors, how the release of two hostages made her feel.

It's a shrewdly conceived, atmospheric, easy-to-like little show, though one that depends a bit too much on a certain kind of stylishness for its own good.         The exhibition, part of the Whitney's Collection in Context series, might be  described as a one-sided collaboration between Hopper (1882-1967) and the young  American multimedia artist Jack Pierson (born 1960), who was invited to make selections from the museum's enormous Hopper holdings and intersperse them with  work of his own.

So what if he had to go to a banquet and wear the pink suit his mother picked out?         Nearly 25 years later, Mr. Mottola, an artist who lives in Long Island City,  Queens, decided to try to find a way to give other children that same dizzy excitement and spark of confidence, without all those dentists.

By Matthew Stadler. (Scribner's, $19.95.) The year is 1915. Nine years after the great earthquake, San Francisco is hosting a world's fair, Model T's and trench warfare have captured the popular imagination and the hero of Matthew Stadler's first novel is coming of age. \\"Landscape: Memory\\" is a portrait of the artist as a painfully sensitive young man, a richly impressionistic tale told in the form of a private journal and illustrated with Mr. Stadler's renditions of the narrator's painting-in-progress. Young Maxwell Kosegarten is a survivor of the great 1906 earthquake. He and his best friend, Duncan, brought together by the disaster, now spend their days exploring a changed San Francisco. They trace the quake's path along the coast, wander through the glittering fair at night and puzzle over their own shared recollections of the past. The process of memory is Max's true fascination: he struggles to fix dynamic events and impressions in his journal just as he yearns to capture a changing landscape in paint. The book remains a bit sketchy and disorienting until Max succeeds in bringing the reader closer to his private world. But the outside world is always interesting, as Mr. Stadler subtly weaves accurate historical details into Max's accounts of his daily experiences. This vivid narrative scene-painting brings a lost era to life, encompassing the thrill of a first automobile ride, the increasing horror of news from the European front and a child's terror as the earth rips apart. Max's memory of the earthquake unfolds late in the book, but it finally allows us to enter his emotional landscape, even as human figures begin to appear in his painting. When Duncan comes closer too, becoming lover as well as friend, the stage is set for passion and tragedy. \\"Landscape: Memory\\" is an unusual and impressive debut, a book that takes both a young man and his city through pain toward maturity.

Presenting sacred objects in a secular setting, the exhibition is a groundbreaking exploration of a religious and cultural diaspora that includes altars assembled and consecrated at the museum.   On purely visual terms, there has probably been nothing quite like it. A \\"bottle tree\\" in the middle of one gallery is a tree festooned with colorful plastic bottles and frying pans, in the manner of Kongo-based shrines in the American South. A jerry-built closet contains a virtual forest and elaborate instruments of ritual, like mirrors and feathers, in a shrine constructed and consecrated by Felipe Garcia Villamil, a Cuban-born Palo Monte priest and artist, who now lives in the Bronx. Another altar, related to AIDS and put together by a Brazilian priest, Pai Balbino de Paula, presents rows of clay pots adorned with metalwork and sprinkled with popcorn, one of the foods sacred to the Brazilian Yoruba deity Omo-Olu. The final altar in the show is timely: a diorama representing Copacabana beach in Rio de Janeiro illuminated by candles, in the manner of a New Year's Eve ritual dedicated to Yemoja, the Yoruba deity of the Atlantic Ocean.

Picking up where George Gershwin left off in painting the city as a glorious musical melting pot of highbrow and lowbrow, European, American and Latin American, Bernstein created music that was as sophisticated as it was optimistic. That upbeat tone mirrored the mood of the postwar era when America felt great about itself and New York City became an international artistic mecca.   \\"The Leonard Bernstein Revue: A Helluva Town,\\" a revue of Bernstein's theater songs at Rainbow and Stars, evokes the vitality of the time with a ferocious eagerness. The show, which has been extended through Jan. 29, creates a retrospective portrait of the city as a magnet for people with oversized dreams of achievement and love. Under the direction of Richard Sabellico, the five cast members -- Marilyn Caskey, Lauren Mitchell, J. Mark McVey, Patrick Quinn and Ruth Williamson -- evoke a bracing mixture of aggressiveness and open-hearted romanticism.

(\\"Raise the Red Lantern\\" provides another example of their teamwork.)   Mr. Zhang is in James M. Cain country with this tale of forbidden romance, in which Gong Li plays a woman who becomes treacherously involved with her husband's adopted son. But Mr. Zhang is also in the rural China of the 1920's, which gives this tale its peculiar wickedness. The director's eye for color and composition is startlingly lovely, as ever. And Gong Li shines. Critics' Choices","excerpt":"Artistic Ideas for Starting the New Year Right"},{"year":"1993","title":"Video   \\"Dave,\\" an airy Capraesque comedy about a Presidential impersonator who secretly fills in at the White House after the Chief Executive suffers a stroke, is a 1930's-style political fairy tale in 90's dress. Dave Kovic, the modern-day Mr. Smith who finds himself running the country, may be a virtual body double for Bill Mitchell, the stricken President, but in his personality he is everything the Chief Executive is not: uncorrupted, happy-go-lucky and concerned for the less fortunate.   More than the story, which turns a bit sticky toward the end, what infuses Ivan Reitman's movie with charm are the performances of Kevin Kline, in dual roles as Dave and the President, and Sigourney Weaver, as an unhappy First Lady who warms to her suddenly transformed husband. Mr. Kline's Dave is a sunny-hearted Everyman who combines the sincerity of the young James Stewart with the suavity of Cary Grant, but he brings to the mix his own brand of springy, deceptively blank-faced niceness.

The characters range from Mort, a retired accountant and long-suffering father, to Rose, an incontinent grandmother who discovers love and racquetball in her old age. If Ms. Glaser didn't transform herself before your very eyes, you'd swear there were five performers in the cast.

It has returned to Film Forum in the South Village, where it will play through Jan. 13.   The film has the same overripe appeal of many smaller 1940's movies in which a tragic love affair sends some woman flying in front of a train or dropping on the pavement (the \\"Waterloo Bridge\\" genre). Victoria Page (Moira Shearer) is torn mercilessly between two men: the heartless impresario Boris Lermontov (Anton Walbrook), who only wants her to dance, and the young conductor Julian Craster (Marius Goring), who wants her to give up her art for love of him. The acting is florid, but the melodrama and snippets of ballet are as alluring as ever.

The Goodfriend gallery has been in Kent for only two months but has been a private print dealership in New York City for 28 years.         A couple of august figures -- Durer and Rembrandt -- are the focus of the Goodfriend offering.
