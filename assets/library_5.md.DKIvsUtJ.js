You may rest assured it wasn't. It is all of six years old—this exceedingly moldy farce-comedy entitled \\"When Knights Were Bold\\"—and the only cleverness which it betokens is that of the exhibitors who have previously passed it up.It is, to state it briefly, a pointless trifle, a minor vaudeville skit, in which Jack Buchanan, pretending to be an English baronet, has a difficult time comprehending the feudal posing of some pompous relatives. Then he gets conked on the head and dreams the time is 1400, which gives rise to such gags as the following - Halberdier: \\"What's afoot?\\" Buchanan: \\"Twelve inches, I think.\\" And, after some aimless aping of \\"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,\\" the time switches back to the present—or rather, to 1936—and Mr. Buchanan espouses the beautiful Lady Rowena, who is merely Fay Wray.If the Little Carnegie is anxious to show none but British product, why doesn't it play in revival some really memorabe films? We can think of two dozen British pictures such as \\"The Ghost Goes West,\\" \\"South Riding,\\" \\"To the Victor\\" and \\"Drums,\\" not to mention the Hitchcock classics, which most certainly retain their appeal.

The piece, directed by Italo Zambo and choreographed by Mohamed Kemoko Sano,  is set in the 12th century and based on the popular Guinean legend of Bala Fassake Kouyate, a lovable griot and ambassador of the Mandingo Empire, and his  fierce opponent, Soumaoro Kante, the warrior who leads the Sosso kingdom. But the chief players in this story are two musical instruments -- the balafon, the  precursor to the xylophone, and the drum -- whose power to charm and pacify help bring about the unification of the peoples of the Mandingo Empire at the end of  the evening.

Problems, for the exhibition titled \\"The Greek Miracle: Classical Sculptures from the Dawn of Democracy\\" at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Visually, the show is enthralling. Among its 45 works in metal and stone are some of the treasures of Western art, many on loan from Greece for the first time, others borrowed from premiere European collections, still others drawn from the Metropolitan's own holdings. They have been beautifully installed in the museum's Robert Lehman Wing. The prospect of large-scale fifth-century B.C. marble sculptures bathed in natural light and in view of one another across the airy courtyard is one of the must-see sights of this art season.   Yet the exhibition itself (organized by the National Gallery of Art in Washington, where it appeared in a somewhat smaller version last fall, with the Metropolitan and the Greek Ministry of Culture) not only lacks any evidence of a shaping hand but has barely an original thought in its handsome head. The world-renowned objects have been gathered not in the interest of new scholarship nor in an attempt to see with fresh eyes the complex society that produced them, but as a kind of travel brochure, replete with a jingoistic promotional title meant to perpetuate cliches about art and its meaning that recent art history has been trying to dislodge.

(d) The Congress pledges its full and continued support for sustaining the policy of increasing economic and diplomatic pressure against Iraq, for maintaining our military options, and for efforts to increase the military and financial contributions made by allied nations.   (e) The Constitution of the United States vests all power to declare war in the Congress of the United States.

Or anyway, that's the impression we get from the London critics. Judge for yourself when David Hare's half-imagined drama ''Stuff Happens'' (the title is based on a quote from Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld) opens at the Taper, with Gordon Davidson directing. It should be interesting to see if the play, which opened last year at the National Theater in London, has turned into a period piece.

By attaching helium balloons to his chair, the main character in the long-gestating musical ''Flight of the Lawnchair Man,'' soars to 16,000 feet. Robert Lindsey wrote the lyrics and score and Peter Ullian wrote the book of this potentially Broadway-bound show at the Norma Terris Theater (May 19-June 12).

She kicks it off with Charlotte Moore's adaptation of the catchy musical ''Finian's Rainbow'' (June 16- July 3) and a little-known J.M. Barrie drama, ''Dear Brutus'' (July 7-24). Ms. Woodward will direct the beautiful period piece ''The Member of the Wedding'' (July 28-Aug. 14), and the season concludes with the antiwar play ''Journey's End'' (Aug. 18-Sept. 4).

''Crowns'' has nothing to do with Henry V, Richard III or any of the rest of those Shakespearean kings swinging swords at theaters throughout the summer. Rather, this play, which ran at Second Stage Theater in New York, is about the splendid hats that African-American women wear down South. And it has been such a hit that Arena is bringing it back for a limited engagement. (202)488-3300 or www.arenastage.org.    SHAKESPEARE THEATER May 26-June 5. Central Park isn't the only place where you can find an outdoor version of ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' free of charge.

Joe Papp isn't the only one to figure out that Shakespeare can be delightful when it's performed outdoors and costs nothing. The ''Shake at the Lake'' production this year is ''Macbeth'' (Wednesday through next Sunday). Then, move inside for performances of ''The Comedy of Errors'' (June 8-Aug. 7), ''A Streetcar Named Desire'' (June 23-Aug. 6) and ''The Cherry Orchard'' (July 7-Aug. 5). The summer finishes off with a show that has something of a built-in audience, ''The Gospel of John'' (Aug. 11-13), a performance that includes every word of the book from the New Testament.

Leading off the summer-long Family Festival of Plays, the comedy begins performances in June. Shakespeare gets another revamp with a 75-minute version of ''The Comedy of Errors'' (June 29-Aug. 14). (312)595-5600 or www.chicagoshakes.com    GOODMAN THEATER Chicago, June 18-July 24. Rebecca Gilman, the provocative author of the plays ''Spinning Into Butter'' and ''Boy Meets Girl,'' has written an adaptation of one of the most adapted plays of our time, ''A Doll's House'' by Henrik Ibsen. Her version will be called ''Dollhouse,'' which is not to be confused with the ''Mabou Mines Dollhouse,'' to be presented at the Spoleto Festival U.S.A. in Charleston, S.C., this summer. The Goodman's artistic director, Robert Falls, directs. (312)443-3800 or www.goodmantheatre.org.    STEPPENWOLF THEATER Chicago. The playwright Adam Rapp has been to hell and back -- or at least his gruesome, lyrical plays suggest as much. So if you're looking for a break from all the summer family fare and Shakespearean verse, try his new drama, ''Red Light Winter,'' about two college buddies who escape Manhattan for a vacation in the red-light district of Amsterdam; Merle Reskin Garage Theater (May 29-June 26). Meanwhile, at the Downstairs Theater, Tracy Letts (who wrote the play ''Killer Joe'') stars in ''The Pain and the Itch,'' Bruce Norris's drama about a dysfunctional family that takes place on Thanksgiving Day (June 30-Aug. 28). (312)335-1650 or www.steppenwolf.org.    Kentucky    MY OLD KENTUCKY HOME STATE PARK AMPHITHEATER Bardstown, June 11-Aug. 20. In the mid-19th century, Stephen Foster did something very strange: he tried to make a living as a professional songwriter. He wrote many standards, including ''Oh! Susanna'' and ''Camptown Races,'' but with poor provisions for royalties and copyright in those days, he saw little earnings and died nearly penniless. If that doesn't sound like the subject of a musical, then you clearly haven't seen Kentucky's annual sensation, ''Stephen Foster: The Musical.'' (800)626-1563 or www.stephenfoster.com.    Maine    OGUNQUIT PLAYHOUSE June 20-Sept. 10. Southern Maine is not exactly known as the showbiz capital of the world, but it does have this longtime outpost for fans of jazz hands, big smiles and show tunes. ''Forever Plaid'' (June 20-July 2) and ''Aida'' (July 5-23) get toes tapping; then the 70's star Sally Struthers surfaces in ''The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas'' (July 25-Aug. 6); and ''Swing'' (Aug. 8-20) and ''Nunsensations! The Nunsense Vegas Review'' (Aug. 22-Sept 10) finish the season with some razzmatazz. In addition, there will be one-day productions of ''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'' (July 2) and ''The Little Mermaid'' (July 16), performed by and for children. (207)646-5511 or www.ogunquitplayhouse.org.    Massachusetts    BARRINGTON STAGE Consolati Performing Arts Center, Sheffield. Last year, Barrington Stage produced ''The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee'' by William Finn. That was before it arrived Off Broadway and then transferred to Broadway, where it opens tomorrow at Circle in the Square. This year, Barrington has another treat for Finn fans, the underappreciated ''Elegies: A Song Cycle,'' a moving and heartfelt tribute to friends of the composer who have died (Aug. 11-28). (413)528-8888 or www.barringtonstageco.org.    BERKSHIRE THEATER FESTIVAL Stockbridge. Incompetent crooks, terrible singers and disastrous relationships are featured in this summer season, with main stage productions of David Mamet's heist play ''American Buffalo'' (July 26-Aug. 13), and ''Souvenir,'' the musical about Florence Foster Jenkins, the worst singer of all time (Aug. 17-Sept. 3). Also at the main stage: ''Side by Side by Sondheim'' (June 21-July 9) and ''Equus'' (July 12-23). In the Unicorn Theater will be Strindberg's ''The Father'' (June 29-July 16), and Rick Cleveland's ''My Buddy Bill'' (Aug. 10-20), about meeting Bill Clinton in a chance encounter and establishing a close bond. (866)811-4111 or (413)298-5576 or www.berkshiretheatre.org.    CAPE PLAYHOUSE Dennis. Where do the Broadway actors go during the off season? Some vacation, others do film and several of the best ones come to this esteemed summer stock theater. André De Shields (''The Full Monty'') headlines a new musical about Louis Armstrong, ''Ambassador Satch: The Life and Music of Louis Armstrong'' (June 20-July 2). Brian Murray (''The Rivals'') stars in a revival of A.R. Gurney's ''The Dining Room'' (July 4-16) and Michael Rupert (''Falsettos'') and Dee Hoty (''Mamma Mia!'') star in Marc Camoletti's comedy ''Dress for Dinner'' (Aug 29-Sept. 10). (877)385-3911 or www.capeplayhouse.com.    SHAKESPEARE AND COMPANY Lenox. Shakespeare wrote more than three dozen plays, but you wouldn't know it by the handful of usual suspects produced throughout the country. So credit this theater with some imagination for mounting the dark and relatively rarely seen history play ''King John'' in its Founders' Theater (July 21-Sept. 3). Preceding it will be the more traditional selection of ''Taming of the Shrew'' (July 8-Sept. 3). At the Spring Lawn Theater there will be a lineup of contemporary work, including ''The Tricky Part'' by Martin Moran, an Obie-winning solo play about one man's relationship with Roman Catholicism (Aug. 16-Sept. 4). (413)637-3353 or www.shakespeare.org.    WELLFLEET HARBOR ACTORS THEATER Wellfleet, May 25-Nov. 6. If you mixed Bill Clinton with Bill O'Reilly, what would you have? Perhaps the main character in ''Public Exposure,'' a play by the former secretary of labor and longtime Clinton pal Robert Reich. His drama, a world premiere to be directed by Gip Hoppe, is about a journalist and a plastic surgeon who persuade a right-wing television anchor to run for president. One problem: the potential candidate can't keep his pants on. Also in the season will be productions of ''Pugilist Specialist,'' ''Bug'' and ''McReele.'' (508)349-6835 or www.what.org.    WILLIAMSTOWN THEATER FESTIVAL July 8-Aug. 28. The venerable summer institution gets a face-lift this year with a new artistic director, the superb actor Roger Rees, and a recently completed 550-seat auditorium. But what hasn't changed are the talented directors and diverse modern works in the main stage. Moisés Kaufman (''Gross Indecency: The Three Trials of Oscar Wilde'') stages Oscar Wilde's ''Lady Windermere's Fan'' (July 6-17); Jo Bonney (''Fat Pig'') directs Caryl Churchill's provocative modern classic ''Top Girls'' (July 20-31); David Jones (''The Caretaker'' on Broadway) mounts Tom Stoppard's farce ''On the Razzle'' (Aug. 3-14); and the Williamstown veteran Will Frears (''Omnium Gatherum'') directs William Inge's ''Bus Stop'' (Aug. 17-28). On the Nikos Stage are three new works by relative unknowns: Etan Frankel, Lucy Prebble and Oni Faida Lampley. (413)597-3400 or www.wtfestival.org.    New Hampshire    BARNSTORMERS THEATER Tamworth. Billing itself as the oldest professional summer theater in America, Barnstormers has been around for 75 years and, judging by its programming, not much has changed in a while. Reliable war horses like ''Arsenic and Old Lace'' (July 26-30) and ''The Fantasticks'' (Aug. 23-27) will be trotted out. (609)323-8500 or www.barnstormerstheatre.com.    New York City    DELACORTE THEATER Central Park. In honor of its 50th-year anniversary, the heavy hitter of al fresco Shakespeare is returning to its tradition of presenting two plays, as opposed to one. The Public Theater's George C. Wolfe will apply his considerable directorial talents to ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' (Aug. 9-Sept. 4). The earlier slot will be filled by ''As You Like It,'' directed by Mark Lamos (June 25-July 17). Lynn Collins, who played Portia in the recent film of ''The Merchant of Venice'' starring Al Pacino, is Rosalind. (212)539-8750 or www.publictheater.org.    ICE FACTORY '05 July 6-Aug 13. While the annual New York International Fringe Festival gets all the attention, this downtown showcase, which has in the past presented work from companies like Elevator Repair Service and the Adobe Theater, is much more discriminating. For example: ''Radio Active Boy Scout,'' about a youth who builds a nuclear reactor in his backyard, directed by Paul Lazar from Big Dance Theater (Aug. 3-6); the International Wow Company's ''Psyche'' is a musical about a 19th-century surgeon whose sexuality was a mystery (July 27-30); and ''Fathom,'' a fantasy about a shell collector and sickly boy which won an award for best production at the 2004 Dublin Fringe Festival (July 6-9). (212)868-4444 or www.sohothinktank.org/icefactory.html.    LINCOLN CENTER FESTIVAL July 12-31. With its ambitious and exciting lineup of plays, the annual Lincoln Center Festival is thinking big -- and long. The first week, there will be Robert Wilson's three-hour, intermissionless ''I La Galigo,'' named after a character in an ancient Indonesian epic poem about such trifles as the creation of the world. It involves a 50-member group of dancers, martial artists and musicians. Next up is Ariane Mnouchkine's supposedly spectacular six-hour ''Le Dernier Caravansérail (Odyssées)'' -- or ''The Last Caravanserai (Odyssey),'' meaning an Eastern inn with an area where desert caravans can rest -- inspired by the experiences of refugees around the world. The show is so large it will be presented in a specially created tent in Damrosch Park. Also on the schedule is the world premiere of ''My Life as a Fairy Tale,'' a musical that explores the dark side of Hans Christian Andersen and was created by, among others, the Chinese director Chen Shi-Zheng (''The Peony Pavilion'') and the Magnetic Fields front man Stephin Merritt; Giorgio Strehler's production of the commedia dell'arte masterpiece ''Arlecchino, Servant of Two Masters''; and the Japanese director Yukio Ninagawa's interpretation of two of Yukio Mishima's ''Modern Noh Plays.''

Deep in the heart of the bluest neighborhood of the bluest state, the Brick Theater serves as host for a four-week showcase featuring plays that explore the theme of moral values. Jon Marans, who wrote ''Old Wicked Songs,'' has a new play about Harry Hay, who founded America's first gay political organization. But the show that will be most talked about, we predict, is ''Ladies Auxiliary Telephone Bee,'' a one-night event in which the performers will telephone politicos for impromptu interviews. Which brings up the question, is Karl Rove listed? (212)868-4444 or www.bricktheater.com.    NEW YORK INTERNATIONAL FRINGE FESTIVAL Aug. 12-28. The most hyped fringe festival in the history of the world returns to take over New York's deadly August theater scene with its usual 200-and-counting shows. Don't even try to ignore it. Resistance is futile. (212)279-4488 or www.fringenyc.org.    SPF: SUMMER PLAY FESTIVAL Theater Row, 42nd Street, July 5-31. Arielle Tepper's well-funded four-week showcase of new work returns for a second year. (212)239-6200 or www.spfnyc.com.    New York State    HANGAR THEATER Ithaca. And the most bizarre-sounding world premiere of the summer is Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa's ''Rough Magic,'' an unlikely cross between Dungeons and Dragons and Shakespeare in the Park. The story revolves around a Manhattan woman who summons up characters from Shakespeare's plays to help her battle an evil sorcerer. The fate of the city, naturally, rests in the balance. The big question is whom should she pick? Coriolanus? Henry V? Or should she just give up and go get drunk with Falstaff? (July 27-Aug. 6). (607)273-4497 or www.hangartheatre.org.    VASSAR AND NEW YORK STAGE AND FILM POWERHOUSE THEATER SEASON Poughkeepsie, June 23-July 31. Whoever came up with the slogan ''always go for extremes'' would have liked this festival last year: it featured a reading of the Pulitzer Prize-winning ''Doubt'' and a workshop of the Pulitzer Prize-losing musical ''Good Vibrations.'' This year there is an intriguing lineup of workshops with film pedigrees, led by a musical adaptation of the Alec Guinness flick ''The Man in the White Suit,'' created by the ''Urinetown'' team of Greg Kotis and Mark Hollmann (June 23-25). Another musical film adaptation will be ''Dangerous Beauty,'' with a book by Jeannine Dominy and music by Michele Brourman (July 7-10). ''Behind the Limelight'' isn't based on a film, but it tells the story of one of cinema's brightest stars, Charlie Chaplin (July 21-24). Among the scheduled plays, the only one with an announced cast is Nicole Burdette's ''Yes! We Have No Pajamas'' directed by Brian MacDevitt and starring Timothy Hutton and Bill Sage. (845)437-5599 or www.powerhouse.vassar.edu.    North Carolina    AN APPALACHIAN SUMMER FESTIVAL Boone, July 1-30. When one thinks of Samuel Beckett, the first thing that comes to mind is not the musical theater. So it might surprise some people that this festival includes a staged reading of a ''new music-theater work'' written by the author of ''Waiting for Godot.'' Beckett, who was trained in music, wrote plays for radio that also had scores by composers, and they will be read -- with brand-new scores. The New York-based Melting Pot Theater Company will do a reading of a new musical, ''In This House,'' by Mike Reid and Sarah Schlesinger, which the company hopes to open Off Broadway next spring. The second night of the festival will be an evening with Lily Tomlin. (800)841-2787 or www.appsummer.org.    Oregon    OREGON SHAKESPEARE FESTIVAL Ashland. You get a little bit of everything at this well-regarded festival that runs from February until Oct. 30. There is a classic American farce, ''Room Service''; a politically cutting comedy, ''The Philanderer,'' by George Bernard Shaw; a World War II-era Italian drama ''Napoli Milionaria!''; an August Wilson standard, ''Ma Rainey's Black Bottom''; two world premieres, ''Gibraltar'' and ''By the Waters of Babylon.'' And, oh yeah, plenty of Shakespeare, too. (541)482-4331 or www.osfashland.org.    South Carolina    SPOLETO FESTIVAL U.S.A. Charleston, May 27-June 12. Size matters in ''Mabou Mines DollHouse,'' an adaptation of ''A Doll's House'' by Henrik Ibsen, in which the female actors tower over the men, who are all no more than four and a half feet in height. Lee Breuer's production, which played in New York in 2003, is only one of several adventurous shows in this reliably interesting festival, which takes place in Charleston, one of the most beautiful towns in the South. Also offered is an international lineup that includes ''Amajuba -- Like Doves We Rise,'' the American premiere of a story about growing up in the final days of South African apartheid; the Colla Marionettes from Italy; and ''Kingdom of Desire,'' a Beijing Opera version of ''Macbeth'' performed by the Contemporary Legend Theater of Taiwan in Mandarin with English supertitles. Mike Daisey, Heather Grayson and Hazelle Goodman will also appear in solo shows. (843)579-3100 or www.spoletousa.org.    Texas    ALLEY THEATER Houston. If you weren't satisfied with the Broadway production of ''Steel Magnolias,'' you may want to head down to the Lone Star State to see the splendid actress and Texas native Judith Ivey direct the aphorism-rich comedy (May 12-June 5). (713)228-8421 or www.alleytheatre.org.    Virginia    SIGNATURE THEATER Arlington, Aug. 16-Oct. 2. Brokenhearted that Little Sally and Officer Lockstop have left Broadway? Not to worry: ''Urinetown,'' the little musical that could, returns to this Virginia theater best known for mounting revivals of Stephen Sondheim musicals. (703)218-6500 or www.sig-online.org.    West Virginia    CONTEMPORARY AMERICAN THEATER FESTIVAL Sheperdstown, July 8-31. This showcase of new work includes dramas by several playwrights with politics on their minds. Audiences can see Sam Shepard's harrowing ''God of Hell,'' Melinda Lopez's ''Sonia Flew,'' which looks at how Sept. 11, 2001, affected different generations, or Lydia Stryk's ''American Tet,'' a contemporary drama about a career military wife. (800)999-2283 or www.catf.org.    Canada    SHAW FESTIVAL Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario, through Nov 27. So what's ''Gypsy'' (April 12-Oct. 30) doing at a Shaw festival? Good question. Contrary to popular belief, this distinguished showcase not only presents plays by Shaw and his contemporaries, but also those about the period in which he lived (1856-1950). That allows a lot of leeway for shows like Somerset Maugham's ''Constant Wife'' (through Oct. 9), R.C. Sherriff's ''Journey's End'' (May 13-Oct. 8), Bertolt Brecht's ''Happy End'' (May 15-Oct. 28), Lillian Hellman's ''Autumn Garden'' (June 11-Oct. 8), William Inge's ''Bus Stop'' (June 28-Nov. 27) and the Canadian playwright Ann-Marie MacDonald's ''Belle Moral: A Natural History'' (July 7-Oct. 7).

If Richard Burton hadn't existed, Mr. Hopkins would have invented him. Dr. Filartiga's 17-year-old son Joelito (Leonardo Garcia) is tortured and murdered in 1976 by police thugs during the brutal reign of Gen. Alfredo Stroessner. Long a critic of the regime, the doctor becomes an open crusader seeking revenge. As something of a celebrity with supporters in the United States, Dr. Filartiga can claim a degree of protection. However, his wife (Norma Aleandro) and two daughters (Fernanda Torres and Mia Michelle) do not, and the doctor's sometimes reckless aggressiveness puts a strain on the family.

The pictures in question are \\"Mon Gosse de Pèere,\\" in which the leading rôle is played by the American Adolph Menjou, the scene being laid in Paris and the production a French one","excerpt":"and \\"Le Spectre Vert,\\" played by a mixed cast, produced in Hollywood in the French tongue, it being the first film made in the United States exclusively for export to France.The internationalism of this latter picture is particularly marked since, while its director, Jacques Feyder, and many members of its cast are French, its scene is laid in England. The Paris press has been enjoying itself commenting on the diction of the players, finding that Messrs. André Luguet, Jules Raucourt and others pronounce their own language with perfection, while that inscrutable lady, Miss Jetta Goudal, they find, speaks French with an accent partly English, partly German.The army of his admirers at home will recall the curious circumstances under which Mr. Menjou, months ago, turned his back upon Hollywood, and proceeding in an easterly direction, eventually turned his back upon New York and in fact the entire Western Continent. Doing so, he uttered a mildly scathing comment upon the condition of film production on the Coast and the treatment of film artists by film magnates. The difficulty, according to reporters at the time, had to do with a new contract for his services, a contract which Mr. Menjou was not pleased with.Mr. Menjou's French Film.He would go to France, Mr. Menjou said, and did. And here one learned of the proposal to star him in the film entitled \\"Mon Gosse de Père.\\" It was to be a talker. Even then there were complications. Work commenced far back in the Winter has only recently been achieved. But now \\"Mon Gosse de Père\\" is showing at the Marivaux, and is being extended there week by week. \\"Excellent Parisian theatre,\\" it is called, and Mr. Menjou in the rôle of an irrepressible parent has had enthusiastic acclaim.Now the bearing of Mr. Menjou's venture upon the audible cinema has become evident. He has turned his face toward Hollywood again, has gone back there crowned with the laurels of his Paris success, and will star in a film there, in French, for French export. Multi-lingual, he will do still another, Paris learns, in Spanish. So the barriers to world markets for the new talking screen are being broken down, and internationalism is the order of the day, as recently exemplified in reports from Berlin, where the French talker known here as \\"La Nuit est à nous\\" is having a run with a German cast, the picture being called \\"Die Nacht Gehert Uns.\\"It is probable, your reporter imagines, that an English version of \\"Le Spectre Vert\\" was turned at the same time as the French version, and that Mr. Menjou will play his new Hollywood pictures at least twice, once in French or Spanish, and again in the tongue current in the sun-kissed barriers of the Golden Gate to the rock-bound coasts of Maine, The idea is limitless.\\"My Young Old Man,\\" as the title of Menjou's picture might be put literally in English, concerns the problem raised by the intrusion of a serious-minded, \\"go-getterish\\" son by a former marriage into the life of a gay-dog boulevardier who has just taken a young wife. The son, brought up in America, is the heir to an imposing soapworks. He swims into the ken of his father, who has almost forgotten his existence, to take over the foreign sales headquarters in Paris.Menjou, the youngish-minded father, an architect by profession, is horribly perplexed by the tortoise-shelled, bustling apparition who nevertheless prevails upon him to mend what a serious American of nineteen would consider an erring life of frivolity, and to get down to work. As Menjou's last prospective client for an architectural job seems to have been irretrievably lost (through that same frivolity), the father agrees to take a salesman's post under his son's direction, and starts out selling soap.Keen Comedy.The comedy at this point is penetrating. Menjou, appearing for work in Oxford coat, gardenia, a topper, lemon gloves and stick, is reclothed by the scandalized youth in a salesman's fedora, his cane and gloves are sequestered, and the Americanization is completed by the imposition of a pair of tortoise-shell spectacles on the Menjou nose. A little baffled, he sets forth. The day is warm. There is no business. The hours drag. By noon he is fed up. The businesslike aphorisms of his son take on less and less meaning. The world, from the point of view of a gentleman-about-Paris disguised as a salesman, is jaundiced.A familiar door beckons to a cool and gay interior. It is Maxime's. The gosse de père slips in, hides the spectacles and the unbecoming hat in a convenient place, takes his seat on one of the convivial stools of the famous bar, and with that act his position, once more, of a gentleman of leisure and the world.Here he meets the former client by chance. With his new business man's vocabulary, learned from his son, and a weighty seriousness of attitude gleaned from the same source, the gosse de père makes a complete conquest of the lost client. At the same time, the son, impressed in spite of himself by his father's worldly cynicism and wit, mimics that to good effect in other spheres. A few complications, permitting Mr. Menjou to display his versatility, and the picture is finished. It drags frequently, but its high spots of comedy are stressed with a sure touch, even if they be comparatively unoriginal.Superior Fooling.The audience liked the picture very much. The Yankee French of the serious young man brought considerable amusement, while Mr. Menjou's speech was, as far as your reporter could learn, accepted with gratifying appreciation. There were moments of very superior fooling, high comedy, notably in the effort of the gosse de père to break the news of his offspring to his bride.We turn, at this point to the Hollywood picture especially issued for the French market. \\"Le spectre vert\\" is the mellowest of melodrama, concerning the effort of a British officer, turned fiend by wounds in the war, to efface the entire mess of his regiment and thus win for himself the fortune which has been bequeathed the group of officers by an erring but repentant comrade. The action takes place in the London fog and in the sumptuous halls of Lord Montague, and is accompanied by dabblings in spiritism, reminiscent of \\"The Thirteenth Chair,\\" shrieks, veiled mysterious ladies, tintinnabulations and acts of violence. It is to be seen at this writing at the Madeleine, a house frequented by many foreigners. It is probable that Hollywood can do better. PARISIAN FILM CHATTER; Mr. Menjou's French Film. Keen Comedy.

The film helps define the word, which has no exact English equivalent, through a series of tales related by a griot, or storyteller. Modern characters who are engaged in a strike against a local industrialist are given courage and inspiration by the griot's historical anecdotes. All of this is presented by Mr. Makharam through vivid pageantry, and with a passion and intensity that reflect considerable jom of his own.    The chief anecdotes concern a turn-of-the-century prince named Dieri (Oumar Seck), who murdered a white colonial official who had insulted him, and then went bravely to his death in battle","excerpt":"and a celebrated dancer who visits the old Senegalese city of St. Louis and while she is there improvises a jom-inspiring dance on behalf of the community's oppressed maids.

But giving this Dutch film its due is a little like making sport of \\"Cinderella.\\"\\"Keetje Tippel,\\" which opened yesterday at the 68th Street Playhouse, comes to us so coated with the sugar of its splendid costuming, its meticulously re-created late 19th-century Amsterdam atmosphere and the classicism of its improbable, happy ending that the temptation is not so much to advise prospective audiences to check their critical faculties at the door as to check their teeth for fresh cavities upon departing.There is little mitigation in the knowledge that the story told in \\"Keetje Tippel\\" is described as being based on fact—the memoirs of a woman named Neel Doff. With her name changed in this film to Keetje (pronounced Kate-yuh), she is one of the children in an impoverished, oversized rural family that, like many others, migrated in 1881 to Amsterdam in search of food and work.A raw, coarse, naïve and irrepressibly spirited girl, she fights against hazing by her fellow workers in a lethal wool factory, is subjected to rape at the hands of a milliner, submits to a doctor who names sex as his price for saving her from death from tuberculosis and becomes a whore under the chaperonage of her mother before her life takes a sudden turn for the better.The events of \\"Ketje Tippel\\" take place amid the terrible poverty of Keetje's family and others like it. One of her sisters is a prostitute. Her young brother takes money from a homosexual. People steal broad. Water floods their homes. Wooden shoes are used for firewood. Warmth and a little food represent dreams come true.Present in \\"Keetje Tippel\\" are the ingredients for powerful social commentary, but the collaboration of the director, Paul Verhoeven, and the cinematographer, Jan de Bont, has produced a movie that is romantic about adversity. From time to time, as though having pangs about the lavish patina they have imposed on such crushing poverty, the movie-makers inject a burst of revolutionary song, an artist who paints revolutionary pictures, though romantic ones","excerpt":"and a confrontation between workers and the police.As Keetje, Monique van de Ven has a field day, making the most of a role that enables her to undergo a transformation from hoyden to lady, playing by turns the coarse peasant, the innocent shop girl and the reluctant prostitute before blossoming into a radiant woman despite everybody and everything that might have destroyed her.By and large, her indestructible spirit is admirable. But it comes to us in a context that makes it seem like one more ingredient in a very well made commercial designed to make hideous social inequality appear appetizing and acceptable.

This year's official Carnival dates are Feb. 25 to 28. If you feel awkward about debauching yourself silly in New Orleans this year -- or if you're unable to book a hotel room there -- plenty of other celebrations exist.   HILARY HOWARD    RIO DE JANEIRO -- Most people can't think of New Orleans without thinking of Mardi Gras. The same can be said about Rio and Carnival. Every February, Rio, like New Orleans, becomes one big party zone, inviting the whole world to watch. At the heart of the city's events are the Samba School parades, which take place nightly in the city's Sambodrome, built specifically for the parades in 1984. Other highlights include a free street band competition at Avenida Rio Branco, starting at 8 p.m. on Feb. 25","excerpt":"and a free performance by the Banda de Ipanema, accompanied by a parade of drag queens, on Feb. 28, at Praça General Osório, near Ipanema Beach.

Mardi Gras in February rocks, but so does slicing through fresh powder on the Colorado slopes. The folks in Gunnison-Crested Butte, have figured it out -- it's a no-brainer, dude. Why not party on the mountain? Bead and mask sales begin on Feb. 22 for the Mardi Gras Parade, which takes place on Feb. 28 at 4:30 p.m. in downtown Crested Butte. The event of the season is a masquerade ball on Feb. 24 at 6:30 p.m. A $75 ticket includes cocktails, a New Orleans-inspired dinner at a local French restaurant, live music and prizes for best costumes. Call 970-349-0366 for ball reservations, and for more general information, call 800-810-7669 or visit www.gunnisoncrestedbutte.com.    PENSACOLA, FLA. -- Though on the Gulf Coast, Pensacola avoided the worst of Hurricane Katrina. This year, the sunny, relaxed city is expected to lure traditional New Orleans revelers to its similar climate. Pensacola's main event, the Grand Mardi Gras Parade, takes place downtown on Feb. 25 at 2 p.m. Paying homage to the moon pies of Mobile, Ala., and the beads and doubloons of New Orleans, throws are plentiful at this family-oriented celebration. One of the city's oldest organizations, the Krewe Lafitte, has its own parade on Feb. 24 at 7 p.m. It is open to the public, followed by a masquerade ball, which is not. The Krewe of Wrecks presents a parade on Pensacola Beach on Feb. 26 at 1 p.m. Danny Zimmern, president of Pensacola Mardi Gras, said potential visitors should book hotels as early as possible because many are already sold out. Visit www.pensacolamardigras.com (850-436-7638) for more information.    SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA -- Gay pride merges with Mardi Gras in Australia's monthlong celebration, which has cultural, athletic and bacchanal-like events all over Sydney from Feb. 3 to March 4. The 2006 Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras embellishes New Orleans traditions, like costumed parades, with its own colorful touches. One such touch is the Human Rainbow Ride on Feb. 12. For the ride, nude and nearly nude cyclists are painted various colors to bike to South Maroubra Beach as a group rainbow. The parade proper takes place in the Darlinghurst neighborhood on March 4.

With ''Get Closer,'' Miss Ronstadt and her producer, Peter Asher, have also wisely returned to the multistylistic format of her pre''Mad Love'' albums, in which the pair systematically 'certified' rock, soul, and country songs as modern standards in sleek, idealized studio settings.

It has had a notable success in Berlin, where it had its first public showing, and repeated that success in several other German towns. It is now being shown in London, and will shortly be put on at a large number of provincial houses which are controlled by a British company. The Alhambra, formerly a well-known music hall, or vaudeville house, in Leicester Square, had to be acquired by British International Pictures and an associated company before \\"Atlantic\\" could be given at one of the leading theatres in the West End of London, as practically all the others had booked up American productions for the Christmas and New Year holiday season. Sir Oswald Stoll, who owns the Alhambra, wanted a very high rent for the hall, which was earning good money with its vaudeville program","excerpt":"and a good many people who heard the price Sir Oswald got predicted that the management of British International Pictures was, in common parlance, \\"buying a pup.\\"British International Pictures, and its direction, would seem to have been justified both in the courage of their production and in their conviction that one thing the British cinema industry stood in need of was a \\"shop window\\" in the heart of London where their wares could be exhibited to advantage.\\"Atlantic\\" is by all odds the outstanding success of the moment, notwithstanding the fact that half a dozen tip-top American talkies are running in close competition with it in the immediate neighborhood. The theatre is besieged by crowds which will bear comparison with the biggest queues which have ever lined up for a transatlantic show. In some respects this is surprising, for \\"Atlantic\\" is not in the accepted sense of the term \\"seasonable stuff.\\" There is nothing Christmassy or festal or holiday-like about it. On the contrary, it is a grim tragedy of the sea, which, less well done, would be rather horrible. It might easily have been overdone. Its pathos might have been made bathetic; its poignant interest might have been forced a notch too high.Dupont, the Director.A. E. Dupont is the producer, and he has fully equaled, if indeed he has not surpassed, the reputation he made by \\"Variety.\\" \\"Atlantic\\" is simpler in its methods than \\"Vaudeville\\" was. Mr. Dupont would appear to have stopped experimenting, because he has found the ultimate rule of cinematographic art in direct simplicity. A London critic writes: \\"Though 'Atlantic' sank almost within sight of America, it will be intering to see if the film gets there. Its technical work has never been surpassed, and Mr. Rosher's photography is wonderful.\\" The implication is, of course, that American interests may be rather shy of showing a British-made film for fear of challenging comparison! It is not within the province of the writer to draw comparisons. It is merely his duty to record that \\"Atlantic\\" is an exceedingly fine production. It has certainly established Elstree securely on the map; whether Hollywood can do as well, or better, may be a matter of individual or national taste. A splendid cast has been got together, including the most popular artists in British filmdom—John Stuart, Madeleine Carroll, Donald Calthrop, John Langden, Ellaline Terriss, Franklyn Dyall, Monty Banks and Joan Barry.The Talk of the Town.It is no exaggeration to say that all the town is talking of this British talker. In fact, just at the present moment British filmdom is rather cock-a-hoop. A new cinema palace has just been opened near Victoria Station, one of the busiest \\"neighborhood centres\\" in middle London. It has been put up by British capital, and it is proposed to make it an abiding home of the British film industry. Its initial program includes a screen presentation of the work of \\"The Cooptimists,\\" a troupe of actors and actresses whose names are almost household words with the London and some provincial publics. The talking and singing of the production is on the highest standard yet attained in this country. It is not of the quality suitable for exportation, being altogether British, but it is confidently expected to hold its own against foreign importations to this country. New Era Films, of which Sir Gordon Craig is general director, expect \\"The Cooptimists\\" to establish their reputation firmly with that section of the cinema-going public which looks principally for amusement from the screen.\\"Splinters.\\"Something along the same lines has been produced by British and Dominions Films and the H. M. V. Gramophone Company. It is called \\"Splinters,\\" and had its inception in a war-time concert party which was famous all along the British front in France and Flanders. \\"Splinters\\" has been described as the British reply to \\"The Cock-Eyed World.\\" It has been so well booked up in advance that seats cannot be obtained at the Capitol, where it is being shown, for some days to come. There are plenty of dances in the piece, and much is made of the \\"sex appeal\\" of the nimble-footed ballet chorus. The joke is supposed to be on the audience, for it is only at a late stage of the proceedings when the dancers tear off their skirts and hurriedly don tunics and breeches to repel a German attack that it becomes apparent these female impersonators are of the \\"superior sex.\\" \\"No Hollywood revue has shown us a more presentable lot of extra girls,\\" says one commentator.All the bigger American talkers which figure on the bill of fare of the moment are known on the western side of the Atlantic, and most of them have had \\"a good press\\" over here. One of the most notable exceptions is Harold Lloyd's first all-talking production, \\"Welcome Danger.\\" There are many laughs in it, but frankly it is rather a disappointment. Harold Lloyd is much better taken neat than when diluted with a tasteless Chinatown beverage mixed up with impossible ingredients.Basil Dean has won no new laurels with the version of \\"Sherlock Holmes,\\" for which, it is true, he is only partly responsible. It is little wonder that Sir Conan Doyle was for so long reluctant to allow his great character to \\"return\\" in this very unsatisfactory guise.

This time, the Volkswagen has air bags, four-wheel drive and a retractable Porsche Targa glass  roof, Jetsons-ready. (A hardtop version will also be produced.) The Wolfsburg, Germany, company will say only that the new Beetle will be available \\"before the end of the century\\" and will not disclose its price, but the worldwide bug supply will come from a factory in Puebla, Mexico.         Witness the hysteria befitting a new Beetle: One Connecticut dealer has taken down payments, sight unseen.

Robert Oppenheimer and Margaret Mead to George Marshall, Pope John XXIII, Martin Luther King Jr. and Mahatma Gandhi, Mr. Gardner elaborates a plausible typology of leadership, and identifies several core characteristics of leaders: shrewdness, eloquence, tenacity, willingness to challenge authority. \\"Leading Minds,\\" written with Emma Laskin, a researcher at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, is persuasive on the importance of two things: a simple, timely story, which a leader both tells and embodies in his or her life","excerpt":"and a ready audience. The analysis is limited, however, to safe generalities and unoriginal biographical material.

'DOROTHY PARKER'    Dorothy Parker, the author and wit, is being portrayed on the stage by Tina Sattin, the actress and director, in \\"What Fresh Hell Is This? An Evening With Dorothy Parker\\" at the Schoolhouse Theater in Croton Falls.    In a series of six short monologues and two lengthier solo pieces -- all written by Parker -- Ms. Sattin at times speaks as the writer, and at times she becomes one of the characters created by Parker.    \\"The Telephone Call,\\" one of the longer pieces, concerns a woman who waits for and receives the phone call from Hell -- her lover telling her that it's all over. In \\"The Waltz,\\" a society woman politely endures the attentions of wearisome dance partners at a soiree, while yearning for one man who is absent.    Ms. Sattin founded and is the director of the Open Cage, a theatrical troupe housed in a former high school at 60 South Third Avenue in Mount Vernon. She has appeared in \\"To Be Young, Gifted and Black\\" and \\"Member of the Wedding\\" on television, and in other productions on and off Broadway. Her performance as Billie Holiday in \\"Lady Day at the Emerson Bar & Grill\\" by Lanie Robertson, seen last October at the Schoolhouse, will be repeated there next fall.    Performances of \\"An Evening with Dorothy Parker\\" are at 3 P.M. today and 8 P.M. Friday and Saturday. Tickets at $12.50 may be reserved by calling 277-8477.  CHILDREN AND ARTS    Dr. Sirgay Sanger, founder of the Parent Child Center at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan and a noted child psychiatrist, will talk about \\"The Arts and Children: Health Promotion for the 90's\\" Friday at 8 P.M. in Golden's Bridge.    Drama, dance, music and the visual arts as means of communicating more profoundly with children, and the attendant benefits to children in terms of self-expression and self-esteem, are strongly advocated by Dr. Sanger and are gaining currency in the education community at a time when funds are being cut in many schools.    Following the talk, to be given at the Northern Westchester Center for the Arts on Old Bedford Road, there will be an open discussion and the audience can view \\"Visions of a Better World,\\" an exhibition of children's art.    Dr. Sanger, a graduate of Harvard College and the Harvard Medical School, has written several books on parents and children and their emotional connections. His latest book, \\"Baby Talk, Parent Talk,\\" was published this year by Doubleday. Admission to the program is free. Call 232-5740 for more information. ARTFUL CHILDREN    Young artists from 23 schools in Westchester, Putnam and Fairfield Counties will have their own juried art exhibition at the Katonah Museum of Art Saturday through May 26. One hundred high school students will exhibit more than 100 paintings, sculptures, graphics, photographs and metalworks that were judged by teachers to be the best in their schools.    The show not only gives budding artists an opportunity for public scrutiny of their work, but provides experience in planning, advertising, hanging and being the hosts for their exhibition.Guided by professionals, the students produced the invitations, posters and program; pondered which works looked best where and how far apart; hammered the nails and set up the sculpture, and now will welcome the guests.    The museum, on Route 22 at Jay Street in Katonah, is open free of charge Tuesdays through Fridays and on Sundays from 1 to 5 P.M.; and Saturdays from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M.

The premise here is rather like that of student course critiques from college days, the ones that assured you could sleep through Botany 101 and still fulfill your science requirement. ''Inside Track'' takes the student off campus and into the job market, with a breezy, relatively straightforward and ultimately unsatisfying look at life and job prospects at more than 50 American companies (and a couple of Government agencies) - based primarily on anonymous interviews with current employees. The profiles of these ''prestige companies - the companies where most people really want to work'' - are geared toward young people fresh from college or those who have been jogging through the rat race for a couple of years.

The absence of ''Guntram'' from the world of opera performance is due mainly to the improbable, and many think impractical, demands of its leading tenor role. Miss Queler seems to have found someone sturdy, or at least brave, enough for the part. He is Reiner Goldberg, a Hungarian who will be making his United States debut. The opera has a Wagnerian tone, both in its severe vocal demands and its theme.

Although the setting of this novel is the American frontier at the turn of the century, and the events and characters are based on historical facts, Anne Leaton's ambitious novel tells the contemporary story of a daughter who ruins her life still struggling to please her disapproving and tyrannical mother, now dead. When the book begins, we see Pearl as she is dying, an obese alcoholic who recalls scenes from her past, regretting her life and cursing the men she has loved. Money is better then men, instructed Belle when she was alive","excerpt":"and after Belle's murder, her ''Baby Pearl'' travels to Fort Smith, Ark., to become ''Queen'' Pearl, the wealthy madame of the town's finest brothel. Although Pearl lives high and grows wealthy, she longs for the comforts luxury cannot provide. She is abandoned by her three great loves - a wealthy bon vivant, a fragile German nobleman and an itinerant gambler. With each successive loss Pearl sinks deeper into self- pity. The scenes of her protracted grief are more numerous and vivid than those of her romantic contentment, so that we suspect she is mourning some greater inconsolable loss.

This is perhaps the most interesting aspect of his book, for even well-told tales about the eccentricities of the hotel's guests, and the obsequious measures by which the staff catered to them, do not always seem as amusing as perhaps once they did. 2,200 BEDS ON FIFTH AVENUE"},{"year":"2013","title":"Reports include retail sales for March","excerpt":"and Alcoa, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo are among the companies set to release quarterly earnings.

This is from her introduction to Poe's \\"Selected Tales\\" (Library of America/Vintage, paper).     To a neglected extent his stories are also about a special aspect of anxiety: hope. They often detail the moment during an unfolding tragedy or danger when the human mind gives in to hope, only to be the more bitterly disappointed. Over and over, a despairing hero is tempted, by a blush on the bosom of the supposedly dead loved one, or by a momentary respite in some torture, to hope -- especially that the dead will come back to life, but also that the narrator is not after all guilty of causing death, or will obtain mercy and reprieve. It is a vein to be worked later and more successfully by Kafka, and it explains the quasi-mystical quality of Poe's stories, and their similarity to, and use as, myths. The Art of the Actual     In Venice, Henry James writes, art and the life of the city are more like complementary parts of a whole than two distinct worlds. This is from his essay \\"Venice,\\" reprinted in \\"The Venetian Hours of Henry James, Whistler and Sargent\\" by Hugh Honour and John Fleming (Bulfinch/Little, Brown).     The whole Venetian art-world is so near, so familiar, so much an extension and adjunct of the spreading actual, that it seems almost invidious to say one owes more to one of them than to the other. Nowhere, not even in Holland, where the correspondence between the real aspects and the little polished canvases is so constant and so exquisite, do art and life seem so interfused and, as it were, so consanguineous. All the splendour of light and colour, all the Venetian air and the Venetian history are on the walls and ceilings of the palaces","excerpt":"and all the genius of the masters, all the images and visions they have left upon canvas, seem to tremble in the sunbeams and dance upon the waves. . . . You don't go into the churches and galleries by way of a change from the streets; you go into them because they offer you an exquisite reproduction of the things that surround you. Tradition's Dwindling Current     As America loses its small towns, its Prairies and Crow Creeks, Richard Critchfield asserts, a critical link to the essential, nourishing traditions of human history is being severed. This is from \\"Trees, Why Do You Wait?\\" (Island Press, paper).      The world's villagers and ourselves all exist in the same continuum stretching unbroken through time. Elisabeth Bumiller describes an Indian village: \\"The ways of the 1,000 people of Khajuron are the ways of most of humanity.\\" We stand at the farthest end of this continuum, the most technologically advanced society ever. But what we find most culturally meaningful is deeply rooted in the distant past. Remember F. Scott Fitzgerald's famous ending to    The Great Gatsby    . . . ? \\"So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.\\" This is how culture works, making us captives of our history. If we let America's Prairies and Crow Creeks go under, leaving most of us in decaying cities or the probably failed experiment of suburbia, Fitzgerald's current becomes shallower, slower, it loses its force. If our cities are to stay healthy, the Prairies and Crow Creeks must survive and thrive. Delicate, Feverish Sensibilities     The Victorians carried prudery to new heights of unintentional absurdity, as Bill Bryson demonstrates in this passage from \\"Mother Tongue: English & How It Got That Way\\" (Avon, paper).     The greatest outburst of prudery came in the nineteenth century when it swept through the world like a fever. It was an age when sensibilities grew so delicate that one lady was reported to have dressed her goldfish in miniature suits for the sake of propriety and a certain Madame de la Bresse left her fortune to provide clothing for the snowmen of Paris. . . . It was an age in which the most innocuous words became unacceptable at a rate that must have been dizzying.    Stomach    became a euphemism for    belly    and in its turn was considered too graphic and was replaced by    tummy, midriff,    and even    breadbasket.    . . . The names for male animals, such as    buck    and    stallion,    were never used in mixed company. Bulls were called    sires, male animals   , and, in a truly inspired burst of ridiculousness,    gentleman cows.   The Endangered Authentic Self     An unfortunate side effect of the almost constant presence of the media in our lives, the psychologist Kenneth J. Gergen suggests, is a loss of the small, subtle, authentic responses to life that compose a personality. This is from \\"The Saturated Self: Dilemmas of Identity in Contemporary Life\\" (Basic Books).      The media expose society to a massive array of self-representations. Our manners of friendship, family relationships, romance, and animosity are documented, scrutinized, rhapsodized, and satirized. We see how the lips are pursed in moments of quiet anger, the fingers move to the mouth as expressions of serious thought, and the tongue flicks backward in moments of cautious reflection. As these images are exposed increasingly to the culture, they become the standards for expression, a subtle Miss Manners for the world of informal relations. They inform the culture, for example, as to how sadness is done -- its duration, its modes of expression, and its proper intensity on various occasions. Indeed, in failing to meet these commonly recognized standards, one cannot properly define oneself as \\"being sad\\" -- either to others or oneself. . . . Our actions are suffused with the sense of metaphor, and we ourselves lose the ability to differentiate between their authenticity and their artifice. NOTED WITH PLEASURE"},{"year":"1985","title":"The Love of the Uncommon    It would be difficult to find a more classical characterization of the nature of fiction than this one quoted from Hardy by Irving Howe in his ''Thomas Hardy'' (Collier). Mr. Howe calls it an ''esthetic of incongruity,'' a phrase which might apply to fiction's latest shimmering product.   The real if unavowed purpose of fiction is to give pleasure by gratifying the love of the uncommon in human experience, mental or corporeal. This is done all the more perfectly in proportion as the reader is illuded to believe the personages true and real like himself. Solely to this latter end a work of fiction should be a precise transcript of ordinary life: but the uncommon would be absent and the interest lost. Hence the writer's problem is, how to strike the balance between the uncommon and the ordinary so as on the one hand to give interest, on the other to give reality. In working out this problem, human nature must never be made abnormal, which is introducing incredibility. The uncommonness must be in the events, not in the characters","excerpt":"and all the writer's art lies in shaping the uncommonness while disguising its unlikelihood, if it be unlikely.

GOLDEN ANNIVERSARY"},{"year":"1970","title":"Despite certain aspirations to high seriousness (and certain achievements in low camp), \\"Freedom to Love,\\" at the Cine Lido, is for the most part another of those movies in which specialists offer Kinsey statistics and Playboy pieties on the soundtrack while assorted young couples have at it with great vigor and in some detail on the screen.But as written, directed and jointly narrated by Drs. Phyllis and Eberhard Kronhausen (authors, editors, teachers, psychologists, art collectors, Ph.D.'s and, according to the press release, \\"two of the world's foremost advocates of sexual freedom\\"), the film views its garden of delights with all the appetitive stimulation of a dietitian imagining marshmallow salad.But the nonfictional episodes are a different, more pleasurable, more ridiculous matter. These range from excerpts out of real dirty plays (for example, Michael McClure's excellent \\"The Beard\\") to an interview with Hugh Hefner (trying to be urbane, and very funny), to an exhibition of erotic art in which the obsessions of the ages are displayed and guilt-free children wander around pulling at a plastic penis.To open the exhibition, held in Lund, Sweden, the statuesque and fortyish Dr. Phyllis Kronhausen emerged, fully clothed, from a piece of plush sculpture called the \\"Womb Tomb.\\" The event is chronicled in \\"Freedom to Love,\\" and for sheer inappropriateness it is the film's best moment.Miserably written, poorly acted and dreadfully dubbed, the frictional episodes \\"illustrate\\" (surely the wrong word) the dilemmas faced by impetuous youth (\\"Yes, Chuck, I'm only 15.\\"), jaded adults, consenting Lesbians, naughty little girls, and others in this as yet insufficiently Kronhausened world of ours.

It is an early animated cartoon, of the 1920's, according to the Kronhausens, featuring a magnificently equipped Barney Google character, who, on his three legs, roams the landscape having happy adventures — one of which turns up an enterprising temptress with bedroom eyes and lascivious lips.

The Shawn Boys Move Beyond Puppet Shows"},{"year":"1930","title":"THERE has been a sufficient output of British films lately to satisfy the tastes of even the most patriotically minded among the devotees of the cinema. \\"Rookery-Nook,\\" which is English to the backbone, even in its characteristic humor, has been playing to record business at the New Gallery Theatre. It is a talking version of a comedy of a kind in which Mr. Tom Wells and Mr. Ralph Lynn have specialized, and it loses nothing in its attractiveness by transference to the sound screen. Mr. Wells possesses one of the finest recording voices yet heard and he conveys no suggestion that tin enters into the composition of his microphone.Where \\"Rookery-Nook\\" has satisfied all tastes to such an extent that it is going to be sent to America to see whether a British film will succeed there purely on its own merits, although it may not possess any special appeal for American audiences, another film which was manufactured with a particular eye to American consumption has on its showing here fallen far short of standards set by British critics. This is \\"The Loves of Robert Burns.\\" It was thought that the story of the Scottish poet whose fame has been spread throughout the world by his fervently admiring countrymen would command a certain amount of universal appeal.Tenor Plays Poet.An undoubted opportunity has been missed in that respect. Joseph Hislop, a well-known and popular tenor, was selected for the rôle of the poet, and he does his part, so far as the rendering of a series of Burns's famous songs is concerned, as well as could be desired. On the other hand, the photographic work is much below the standard and the character of Bobbie is divested of most of those qualities which endeared him to his readers as a man as his verse commended him to them as a poet. \\"The Loves of Robert Burns,\\" indeed, was so unsatisfactory to the London public that it was withdrawn at the end of one week's trial at a central cinema, although it had been largely advertised in advance. Herbert Wilcox was the producer and apparently he fell between two stools—that of finding a singer who could do justice to Bobbie Burns's \\"Comin' Through the Rye\\" and other equally famous ballads, and an actor who could present an adequate picture of Robbie the man.Miss Edna Best, who is well known on the New York stage, has made her screen díbut in a version of \\"Sleeping Partners,\\" a comedy adapted from the French in which Seymour Hicks had a measure of success some years ago. This is also Mr. Hicks's talking film díebut. Both players have struck an immediate success. Both their voices record admirably. Miss Best is now making a film in connection with another London stage favorite, Owen Nares.British International Pictures, which have registered a series of successes with \\"Atlantic,\\" \\"Blackmail\\" and \\"Juno and the Paycock,\\" appear to have been a little less lucky with their latest talking film, featuring Miss Betty Balfour, one of the leading stars of the English silent film.Miss Wong as a Dancer.\\"The Flame of Love\\" is the ardent title of a new talking film produced by the same firm with Miss Anna May Wong as the heroine and with scenario and dialogue by Monckton Hoffe. Miss Wong is not allowed to do much talking, but the audience is allowed to see a good deal of her in various varieties of inextensive attire. Anna May Wong is the beautiful leader of a Russian dancing troupe, who is the object of admiration by a Russian Grand Duke—the story is laid in pre-revolution days—and the beloved object of the Duke's adjutant. There is plenty of lovemaking, both sacred and profane, and more than a sufficiency of cabaret dancing","excerpt":"and altogether the story holds the spectator's interest throughout. John Longden, who, by the way, some people say is \\"Sir John Longden,\\" is the hero.Another British-made sound film which has met with more than average success is again a product of British International Pictures, Ltd. \\"The Compulsory Husband,\\" drawn from a novel by John Glyder, aims at nothing higher than providing good amusement, and good amusement it does provide. In fact, it provides a little too much of it, for it runs for about an hour and a half, which is somewhat a tax upon the risible faculties. Monty Banks and Harry Lachmann are the joint directors, and the former also plays the leading part. \\"The Compulsory Husband\\" is Mr. Banks's first sound film, and it compares very favorably with American importations of the same classification.On the whole, however, it may be stated that American productions, notwithstanding the onslaught being made upon them at the moment are quite successfully holding their own. \\"The Love Parade,\\" in which Maurice Chevalier has scored a personal triumph, is having a long run at the Carlton, and \\"Sally,\\" with Miss Marilyn Miller, promises to repeat the success of \\"The Gold Diggers of Broadway\\" at the Regal. British producers are patting themselves on the back at having set a lead which Hollywood has had to follow. \\"Atlantic\\" was produced bilingually—in English and German; and the plan was so successful that a French version is now in preparation at the Elstree Studios. Hollywood is reported to be only now at work on a French version of \\"The Love Parade.\\" On their side German firms are working on the production of bilingual films, the first of which will be \\"The Blue Angel,\\" in which Emil Jannings will appear.For Latin America.A similar venture to make an inroad upon the South American firm is planned by an Anglo-Spanish syndicate which will produce bilingual screens, partly in London and partly in Madrid, suitable for distribution in South American countries. Work has already begun upon one film which is expected to make a sensational appeal to the 70,000,000 Spanish-speaking population of South America. Some scenes have already been taken in Madrid, and famous Spanish artistes have now come to London, where the talking records will be made.An attack is being made on the British Board of Film Censorship from two quarters, and there seems some likelihood that the question will ultimately be brought before Parliament and fought out to the bitter end. At present there are two forms of censorship—one exercised by a board appointed by producers and exhibitors and the other vested in local authorities. These two censorships not infrequently find themselves at variance, with the result that there is considerable dissatisfaction. Some of the leading producers are advocating the creation of an official censorship on lines somewhat akin to those of the Lord Chamberlain's supervision of stage plays.

For anyone left who has not seen the remarkably popular movie, this concerto was, broadly speaking, the fulcrum on which Mr. Helfgott's complex and tormented young life turned. As the film tells it, Rachmaninoff's sweeping, brooding, difficult music became an obsession for the promising young pianist.

Soviet net debt in 1982 stood at $10 billion and its debt-service ratio (to current earnings) was only 16 percent, respectable by any standards.

Pudovkin, one of Russia's film veterans, this latter is about a twenty-four-hour, non-stop stratosphere flight around the world. It moves considerably slower.Pudovkin's heroine is the best part of the show. She is the calm, matter-of-fact, peasant mother of two of Russia's most promising fliers. One of her sons commands the first stratosphere plane. When it is forced down and feared lost, her younger boy volunteers for the aerial search party. She bears the loss of the first bravely, heroically commands the younger son to join his squadron on the hazardous rescue mission. The conclusion finds her undaunted still. \\"What men we have today,\\" she says, \\"and they come from such ordinary mothers.\\" The Mother of the Pudovkin film is a grand person.But Pudovkin, unhappily, is serving two masters. Drama is one; the Soviet is the other, and the greater. Nothing slows up a good aviation picture more than interminable shots of plane tests, farewell speeches, small talk in the control cabin. Then, too, if we must have a forced landing in the mountains, we expect to have a little excitement to go with it—a bit of strut-screaming, the sound of impact—and we don't expect, in the next sequence, to find the craft perched smoothly on a ledge near the sea with the crew attempting patriotically to ready it, and a land plane at that, for a take-off over the breakers.There are these jarring inconsistencies and production weaknesses, and there is, moreover, a deal of pother over hurricanes, electrical bombardments, broken arms and such, which lead invariably only to smashing anti-climaxes. They ring hollow as melodrama and, since they do not advance the drama, Pudovkin might better have tossed them out and concentrated more upon the theme his title advertises—Mother and Sons. In brief, there is much good in it, but little of it that holds to a dramatic line.\\"The Bear\\" is a nonsense item, but good fun, about a blustering woman-hater who calls upon a fair but fiery widow for payment of a debt, challenges her to a pistol duel and winds up cooing, instead of billing, on the field of honor. Although it does not advance Soviet's reputation a bit and moves on a plane miles lower than the stratosphere, it impressed me, at least, as much the better part of the Cameo's anniversary twin-bill.

I don't know if you've heard, but I'm about to go on a world tour, and I was wondering if you'd like to film it.\\"    Mr. Keshishian said he certainly would, and a few hours later he found himself at the Disney Studios, where the pop singer was engaged in final rehearsals for her \\"Blond Ambition\\" tour.    Now, this may sound like someone's idea of a fantasy, but in the case of Mr. Keshishian, a Harvard graduate who is 26 years old, it was definite reality. The result is the much-talked-about new documentary \\"Truth or Dare,\\" which follows Madonna on and offstage during the concert tour of Japan, the United States, Canada and Europe.    Mr. Keshishian said he had come to Madonna's attention when the Creative Artists Agency, which represents both of them, showed her a videotape of a pop opera Mr. Keshishian had done at Harvard -- a version of \\"Wuthering Heights\\" in which the character of Catherine was portrayed, in part, through the use of the singer's recordings.    When Mr. Keshishian discussed the proposed documentary with Madonna, he said, her conception of it was \\"the concert with a little bit of behind-the-scenes stuff.\\"    But, he said: \\"I went to Japan, and I shot 30 hours of behind-the-scenes stuff, and I did all these interviews with all the individuals, dancers and Madonna, and I would capture them all in bed when they were waking up, so the interviews had an incredibily intimate tone to them, and I was able to capture a lot of other little stories that took place in Japan. When we got back to Los Angeles and Madonna had a chance to look at some of the dailies, I think she shared my enthusiasm for what I captured. So when I turned around and said we should make this a feature film with the emphasis mainly on this behind-the-scenes stuff, she agreed almost immediately.\\"    Mr. Keshishian said that among the themes he wanted to explore was family -- \\"both the real family and also the sort of surreal family that was formed on the road by this group of people\\" -- as well as \\"fame from the inside looking out\\" and some \\"universal moments.\\"    In the end, Mr. Keshishian said, he edited 250 hours of film into a 1-hour-58-minute documentary. Madonna, he said, was not a participant in the editing.    He said: \\"It never got into what a lot of people assume, with Madonna saying, 'You can't use that' or 'You can't use this.' I think that to a certain degree, Madonna met her match in that regard when she met me.\\"    Mr. Keshishian said, \\"Yes, we're still friends.\\"    In terms of the impact of \\"Truth or Dare\\" on his career, Mr. Keshishian said Hollywood was now thinking of him as a feature-film director rather than as a director of music videos, as he was for such performers as Bobby Brown, Vanessa Williams and Elton John. So scripts are flowing in. But even though it may be deferred while he makes some other movie, his \\"dream project\\" remains \\"Wuthering Heights,\\" which he said he was developing with Irving Azoff, the president of Giant Records. \\"It would be a feature film, and it would be an entire pop opera.\\"    Mr. Keshishian said he was not prepared for the stir that \\"Truth or Dare\\" has caused. \\"Oh, no,\\" he said. \\"I don't think anybody was. I always felt I would make a movie that I want to see and be entertained and touched by, but I think for a while there the only other person who believed in this feeling I had was Madonna.\\"  High Jinks at the Ballet     About the same time that Mr. Keshishian was receiving that phone call from Madonna, Dennis Dugan -- who had directed episodes of \\"Moonlighting,\\" \\"Wiseguy' and \\"Hunter\\" for television -- invited some friends he had met through an environmental group to come over to Univeral Studios to give their opinion of his first feature film, \\"Problem Child.'    The friends were David Zucker, Jim Abrahams and Pat Proft, whose names -- in one capacity or another -- should conjure up the credits for movies like \\"Airplane!' and \\"Naked Gun.\\"    \\"So they came over,\\" said Mr. Dugan, \\"and gave us really good notes","excerpt":"and an hour later, David called and said, 'There's a script on the way over to your house.' \\"    Mr. Dugan said, \\"When I read a script and I get to page 30, about that time is when I've made the decision. Do I care about these people? Do I care about this story? Do I care about this at all? I got to page 30 on this one, and I crossed my fingers and I said, 'Please, Pat, please be able to sustain this.' \\"    Mr. Dugan said his worries were unfounded, and now Mr. Proft's script has been turned into a film titled \\"Lame Ducks,\\" starring John Turturro, Mel Smith and Bob Nelson as contemporary versions of the Marx Brothers and tentatively scheduled for release on July 26 by Paramount Pictures.    \\"These three,\\" Mr. Dugan said of the characters portrayed by his stars, are \\"very minor-league con men, scam artists.\\"    Mr. Dugan said: \\"My approach to comedy would be the same as my approach to drama. It's that you have to believe it. You can get crazy and you can be splapsticky, but essentially the core of the story and the core of the character and the core of the joke have to be logical.\\"    \\"I'll give you, I think, a very good example: Victor Borge would not be funny, be able to play the piano and make you laugh if he were not a tremendously great piano player.\\"    At the Movies"},{"year":"1986","title":"IN the introduction to his ''Tales of Travel'' in 1923, Lord Curzon wrote: ''Travel is still the science of the unexpected and the unknown.

The most grievous flaw of Jacqueline Weld's book ''Peggy, The Wayward Guggenheim,'' along with its trite, cliche-ridden style, is that it exploits the more sensationalistic aspects of her private life at the expense of any solid insight into her artistic vision.   However, this biography is the only one to have been authorized by Peggy Guggenheim, whose compulsive sexual exhibitionism is amply evidenced in her own memoirs, ''Confessions of an Art Addict'' (1960). Mrs. Weld's access to her subject's private papers and to weeks of her ever ingenuous conversation enables her to dredge up many telling details of her subject's early years to which later eccentricities are traced.

Since it is obvious we lack Miss Maxwell's qualifications for research in the field, we suppose we shall have to take her word for it that places like the Hotel Sherrington really exist, with beautiful creatures swarming all over the lobby, and where an innocent from Syracuse may, in a twinkling, become the Cambridge cigarette girl and the toast of a trio of pent-housed millionaires.An incurable romanticist, despite her mannish toggery, Miss Maxwell brings her Syracuse belle to town to meet her young man, cries with her a little when she discovers he has changed and consoles her prettily with a new career, flowers, lovely gowns, wealthy admirers and most of the other fleeting substitutes for Love. (But all the time she knows, and we know, and all the shopgirls in the audience know that there is no Substitute for Love, that there's a Wolf in Every Penthouse—and not just at its door—that A Career Is No Cure for a Broken Heart and that A Misunderstanding should not be permitted to Wreck a Girl's Life.)Beyond this nothing really need be said about the picture except that it introduces a newcomer, one Linda Darnell, who is as pretty as a model should be and probably will not be challenging Miss Bette Davis's academy title for quite a few years.

Any use of a word stretches it slightly, because any use selects from among many meanings the right one, and then modifies that in the context. . . . If Mr. Stevens stretches his words slightly, as a live poet should and must, it is in such a way as to make them seem more precisely themselves than ever. The context is so delicately illuminated, or adumbrated, that the word must be looked up, or at least thought carefully about, before the precision can be seen. This is the precision of the expert pun, and every word, to a degree, carries with it in any given sense the puns of all its senses. Where to Put a Thinker in Paris?

The main attraction, \\"Sunrise,\\" the first film to be made in America by F. W. Murnau, director of \\"The Last Laugh\\" and \\"Faust,\\" was prefaced by several excellent Movietone features, in which the figurantes were heard as well as seen. It was distinctly impressive to look upon the physigonomy of Henry P. Fletcher, the United States Ambassador to Italy, and hear him present, while standing on Italian soil, Benito Mussolini. It was also wonderful to hear and see the Duce come from a building and reply to the introduction. In the course of this brief address Mussolini referred to the energy of the American people.\\"I salute the noble Government of the United States,\\" the Duce was heard to say. \\"I salute the Italians of America, who unite in a single love our two nations.\\"Mussolini also made a Movietone talk in Italian. Other synchronizations of sound and sight were the Vatican Choir, the renditions of which were stirring. Then there were the Italian troops on parade with their bands, and not only were the officers' commands heard, but also the stamping of their horses' hoofs. Actually, this was as perfect a series of screen views combined with sound as could well be imagined.The other phase of the entertainment was the new picture, which cost a staggering sum of money","excerpt":"and as it is unfurled one appreciates the tremendous task that confronted the producers in turning it out.\\"Sunrise\\" was adapted from Hermann Sudermann's story \\"A Trip to Tilsit,\\" and, although Tilsit is actually a town in East Prussia, it is set forth in one of the very few subtitles that the locale of this story might be in any country. As it threads its way across the screen this narrative gathers impetus. It is filled with intense feeling and in it is embodied an underlying subtlety. Mr. Murnau shows himself to be an artist in camera studies, bringing forth marvelous results from lights, shadows and settings. He also proves himself to be a true story teller, and, incidentally, here is a narrative wherein the happy ending is welcome.The principals in this gripping subject are George O'Brien and Janet Gaynor, who both give inspired performances. It is a slowly told tale, and sometimes Mr. O'Brien appears to be just a little lethargic in his movements, but this is explained by the nature of the character he is portraying—a susceptible, thick-headed country lout, a man who never gives a thought to his appearance and who is utterly ignorant of anything approaching social amenities. Miss Gaynor impersonates his faithful, trustful wife and mother of his baby. At the outset there is a bedizened girl from the city, who delights in gazing down at her shiny patent-leather shoes. She entrances the Man (Mr. O'Brien), and after he slips away from his home she caresses him and then suggests that he sell his farm and come to the city and live with her. The Man, who is unshorn and wears a flannel shirt, asks what about his wife, and the City Girl whispers to him to take his wife out and drown her.She tells him that by capsizing the boat he can make it appear to be an accident. Thereupon the Man is seen bidding his wife to come to her doom, but when he is about to throw the poor little creature overboard, he thinks better of it. He rows over to the other side of the lake, but once the Wife sets foot on shore she flees in fear, followed by her lumbering husband. Mr. Murnau then goes on to depict the joy of the Man in having discovered how greatly he loves his wife.In a remarkable series of scenes one is taken through the city on a tram car, and then follow the adventures in an amusement park, in which a straying pig affords some of the comedy. Mr. Murnau does all his work quite differently from any other director and when he stoops to somewhat hilarious fun it does not matter, for it is filmed with astuteness and originality.In an early chapter there are a flood of flashes concerned with people going on a holiday, and you perceive a steamboat's nose shot up mystically on the sands of the sea-shore. To show the city, an immense set was constructed, and on it there were two surface oar lines and countless vehicles. You perceive a whirring disk and then this gradually dissolves into the joyous sight of the amusement park.Mr. Murnau uses a moon, and he evidently likes its reflection on the water. He fashions a storm on a lake, and keeps the spectators on the edge of their seats until the finale of the production. He makes you hope that the characters won't do such and such a thing, and you trust that the Man and his Wife will get back safely to their picturesque little farm-house.This picture is exotic in many ways for it is a mixture of Russian gloom and Berlin brightness.Miss Gaynor, guided by the genius of Mr. Murnau, gives a strangely sympathetic portrait of the Wife. Her hair is braided into a coil at the back of her head, and her big, bright eyes are never like those of the usual Hollywood actress. Margaret Livingston impersonates the City Girl with felinelike watchfulness and purring caresses. There is not a weak spot in any of the performances and the incidents are stamped with genuineness and simplicity. You find yourself thinking now and again that it is just the sort of thing farm people might do on going to Tilsit.Mr. Murnau proves by \\"Sunrise\\" that he can do just as fine work in Hollywood as he ever did in Germany.

They are stimuli for our own impulses, and through them, players and listeners gain a sense of self, their powers of initiative within a world of randomness severely tested.

So highly is Coutard regarded that some critics unfriendly to the French New Wave have speculated that the real genius behind films like \\"Une Femme Est une Femme\\" and \\"La Chinoise\\" was the photographer and not the director at all. For this line of reasoning to be laid to rest, I suppose it would be necessary for Coutard to make his own movie, and this he has now done. It is called \\"Hoa-Binh,\\" and it opened yesterday at the Lincoln Art Theater.In many respects it is very much a photographer's movie. Looking not at all like Truffaut or Godard, it is full of muted colors, striking images that seem to have been included for their own sake, and details held in splendid isolation — as the camera rather than the eye might see them. All of which gives \\"Hoa-Binh\\" a curiously old-fashioned and rather artlessly handsome look not entirely inconsistent with the moods of its story—which is, however, set in the midst of the modern and unlovely reality of contemporary South Vietnam.Although it was made under the shadow of, and is necessarily about, the war in Vietnam, \\"Hoa-Binh\\" goes to almost excruciating lengths to avoid propagandistic persuasion. And although its locations are actual and its actors mostly amateur, it has a story, and its reality is the reality of fiction and not of documentary.The hero is named Hung, an 11-year-old boy whose father goes off to join the Vietcong and whose mother shortly afterward is hospitalized with terminal cancer. The sole protector of his baby sister, Hung soon leaves the unfriendly cousin with whom he has been placed and begins to make his way in the young-people's free-enterprise world of Saigon. He tries his hand at stevedoring and gambling, at which he does well","excerpt":"and at shoe-shining and newspaper-selling, at which he does badly.In general, the children's fortunes decline, but in the knick of time a nurse, a total stranger, takes them in, gives Hung shelter, gets him a job, and places the baby in a nursery. Meanwhile from the North, Hung's father begins a journey home, to deliver messages and to begin again with what is left of his family.I'm not sure that any movie based on a fiction so limited and, in a sense, so gratuitous, could be wholly satisfactory. \\"Hoa-Binh\\" adds to its simplicities a kind of hapless awkwardness in execution, in the mechanics of simply carrying a scene through. And at the same time it introduces ideological material—a humane justification of the American presence overheard from an Army sergeant while Hung shines his shoes; an organizer's lucid promise of Vietcong victory while United States jets roar overhead—that it is not really prepared to digest except in terms of obvious ironic illustration of the futility of high thought in a world of low feeling and of intensely personal privations.But \\"Hoa-Binh\\" ultimately succeeds beneath the play of ideology, and despite its structural crudities, and even despite the indulgences that Coutard sometimes allows his camera. For it is a deeply honorable work, as honorable in its refusal to place blame as in its decency in the face of human suffering. In this it achieves a moral reticence that approaches asceticism and that is as beautiful to watch in the movies as anywhere else.You can see it most clearly perhaps in the lovely performances of Phi Lan as Hung and Xuan Ha as his young mother. If you watch their eyes you will see that their looks and glances, wonderful in themselves, are used not to externalize suffering and so engage the audience's sympathy, but to communicate and so build a world of shared understanding—even though that understanding may include not only love but also fear and hate.The result is a self-sufficiency that begs no responses, but that is moving in some of the ways that film can be moving—without at the same time losing its bearings and pretending that it is life. Anyone can imagine a dozen movies about Vietnam, full of searing indictments and heartbreaking revelations. But \\"Hoa-Binh\\" is none of these. With all its faults it is something very much better, more complete, more secret, more genuinely in touch with the mysteries of human perception.

In all its career the Rio Grande knows several typical kinds of landscape, some of which are repeated along its great length. It springs from tremendous mountains, and intermittently mountains accompany it for three-fourths of its course.

Again, the desert closes against the river, and the gritty wastelands crumble into its very banks, and nothing lives but creatures of the dry and hot; and nothing grows but desert plants of thirsty pod, or wooden stem, or spiny defense.

He plays with them, alone, sitting on the floor near the console hour after hour, chanting 'onesies, twosies, threesies, foursies' in a precise, well-modulated voice, not so loud as to be annoying, not so soft as to allow me to forget.'' There were stories about a vast, free-hanging balloon that covered the city from 14th Street to the Plaza, about someone who finds himself involved in an unsatisfying friendship with the Phantom of the Opera (''Why must I have him for a friend? I wanted a friend with whom one could be seen abroad. With whom one could exchange country weekends, on our respective estates!''). The style sparkled with intelligence; it was dry and clear.

WORKING LIKE A STAND-UP COMIC"},{"year":"1968","title":"\\"I EVEN MET HAPPY GYPSIES,\\" a Yugoslav movie, in color, which opened yesterday at the Regency Theater, stars Bekim Fehmiu, a young actor who looks and behaves a lot like Jean-Paul Belmondo and who, in 1966, won the Silver Arena in Pula for his performance in \\"The Journey.\\" The movie was written and directed by Alexandar Petrovic, who has made a number of documentaries, as well as \\"When Love Has Gone.\\" \\"The Days,\\" and \\"Three.\\" \\"Three\\" was shown last year at the New York Film Festival and was awarded first prize at the Festival of Karlovy Vary.The leading lady, Gordana Jovanovic, is a 16-year-old girl whom Petrovic found gathering feathers in the gypsy suburb of Vrsac. The film also stars Olivera Vuco, one of Yugoslavia's most popular singers and actresses and a member of the National Theater of Belgrade","excerpt":"and Bata Zivojinovic, who won an award at Pula for his performance as Milos in Three.\\" Mr. Zivojinovic plays Miss Jovanovic's step-father.The movie itself is a little hard to follow. It is about a lot of gypsies living in thatched Busiri-Vici white cream houses, in mud and color and squalor, north of Belgrade in the Panonian Plain, where they deal in goose feathers. There is some trouble over women, and feather-trading territories, and Fehmiu has a moment of existential refusal—like the halt in the run of the Long Distance Runner—when he releases feathers he has just bought from the back of a truck all over the road. There is also a knifing, and a quotation from Scripture about the evil spirit passing into some swine, who subsequently do away with themselves. But aside from people getting drunk or going back and forth from Belgrade to visit relatives, it is nearly impossible to understand the broad outline of the story without program notes.What happens, then, is an almost pure case of being amused by some of the film without the slightest idea of what people are up to. There are some pleasant gypsy songs, Miss Vuco is a fine performer in a happy, feral way, Fehmiu narows his eyes and scrunches his cigarettes, and one has beautiful shots of landscapes and gypsies with a kind of travelogue interest. There are all those feathers, the film is a little scratched in places, and the sound is (as it has been in a number of movies lately) quite out of synchronization with the lip movements. There is a slang word, 'jok,' pronounced sort of yock, that recurs a lot and is translated in the sub-titles as \\"by no means.\\"Some parts are shot with the foreground sharp and the background blurred; others with the background sharp and the foreground blurred. The nail on Fehmiu's little finger is long—as it is in several Mediterranean countries to show that a man is not a manual laborer. There are a lot of Bosch-like groupings and lovely scenes of gypsies and horses and plains. It is a movie for watching in idle incomprehension—like sitting by the window watching what goes on on one's block, in a foreign country, in a crowded neighborhood.

Reality often looks faked or simply unimportant. The camera can lie. In the wrong hands it has an unfortunate way of shifting emphasis to the non-essential detail that illuminates nothing.There are currently playing first-run in New York four new documentary features, more than at any time that I can remember, including the late 60's when some thought that the documentary form was about to revolutionize the cinema. Though I doubt that these films signal any particular trend, they do define particular values and limitations. It's apparent from the four films — John Lowenthal's \\"The Trials of Alger Hiss,\\" Ira Wohl's \\"Best Boy,\\" Glenn Silber and Barry Alexander Brown's \\"The War at Home\\" and Maxi Cohen and Joel Gold's \\"Joe and Maxi\\" — that the promised revolution has had more to do with the technology of lightweight movie equipment than with the esthetics of cinema. Like the good fiction film, the good documentary film still demands a guiding intelligence, a filmmaker with a point of view.Of the four new pictures, two (\\"The Trials of Alger Hiss\\" and \\"The War at Home\\") belong to the kind of general-subject documentary that at one time was represented almost exclusively in this country by the old March of Time series, but time has certainly marched on.Both \\"Best Boy\\" and \\"Joe and Maxi\\" recall the work of Albert and David Maysles, who, in the 60's developed camera and sound equipment of such portability that the Maysles brothers could enter the private lives of their subjects and record the details with a minimum of self-consciousness. Without the Maysles, whose films (\\"Salesman,\\" \\"Gimme Shelter,\\" etc.) owed much to the pioneering films of Richard Leacock and D.A. Pennebaker, I doubt whether there would ever have been a \\"Best Boy\\" or a \\"Joe and Maxi.\\"\\"The Trials of Alger Hiss\\" and \\"The War at Home\\" each explores a particularly dismaying chapter in recent American history, and if \\"The Trials of Alger Hiss\\" is the more moving and provocative of the two, it's largely because Mr. Lowenthal, a lawyer-turned-filmmaker, has a protagonist he can see in heroic terms. But \\"The Trials of Alger Hiss\\" is much more than the story of Mr. Hiss's two 1949 perjury trials, his nearly four years in prison and his subsequent efforts to clear his name. It's the record of fashions in American political thinking, adventurous and repressive, from the Great Depression through the years of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal, the administrations of Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon, the Cold War and the Korean War, the Vietnam War, on through Watergate and the Watergate-prompted backlash represented by the Freedom of Information Act. This act, Mr. Lowenthal is convinced, has forced the government to make public previously classified material that raises serious questions about the manner in which Mr. Hiss was prosecuted.I suspect that Mr. Lowenthal believes that these disclosures are the most important elements in his film. To the rest of us — to those of us who are not experts on the contradictory details of the Hiss case — the power of the film is not in the proven innocence or guilt of Mr. Hiss but in its recapitulation of history as recorded then, principally in newsreels, and as remembered now, in interviews with Mr. Hiss and with other survivors of that era. This perspective, the gift of time, invests \\"The Trials of Alger Hiss\\" with an appreciation for the uses of history that is rare in a documentary movie and virtually non-existent in most of our contemporary fiction films.\\"The War at Home\\" is a much less complex film about a subject that — today, anyway — is nowhere near as controversial as the Hiss case still is. In \\"The War at Home,\\" Mr. Silber and Mr. Brown recall the radicalization of students at the University of Wisconsin at Madison in the years between 1963 and 1973, from the first peaceful protests against the Vietnam War to the culminating violence on campuses all over the country as the war came to an end.If \\"The Trials of Alger Hiss,\\" being centered around a compelling, complicated character who has defied time and fashion, is like reading fiction at its best, \\"The War at Home\\" is a little like thumbing through the news magazines of the decade it covers. It has no particular focal point, no hero, no revelations of spirit that contradict what we believe or throw new light on the events it remembers. It's a perfectly adequate film, not especially surprising, a walk down Memory Lane.Both \\"The Trials of Alger Hiss\\" and \\"The War at Home\\" are examples of a kind of journalistic film that, all other things being equal, must take its scope from the subject. More than a quarter of a century of remembrance is the true subject of \\"The Sorrow and the Pity,\\" Marcel Ophuls's classic film about France during its occupation by the Nazis. Mr. Ophuls was no less a filmmaker when he later made \\"A Sense of Loss\\" about the war in Northern Ireland. \\"A Sense of Loss\\" is a painstaking movie, but it's not an especially satisfying one. The subject, being current, resists the kind of conceptualizing required in art but which is difficult for a filmmaker attempting to keep an open mind. The Vietnam War had only recently ended when Peter Davis completed his \\"Hearts and Minds,\\" but his feeling of unmistakable fury, which prompted the film's production in the first place, gave it shattering life as a movie.\\"Best Boy\\" and \\"Joe and Maxi\\" are documentaries of an entirely different order, being about ordinary citizens with whom, in each case, the filmmakers have relationships that predate the production of the film.\\"Best Boy\\" is a wonderfully gentle, wise and sympathetic portrait of Mr. Wohl's cousin Philly, a retarded 52-year-old man who, in the course of the production (and possibly as a result of it), begins to make some initial progress in self-reliance. The film is also about the other members of Philly's family, particularly his mother and father","excerpt":"and because Mr. Wohl is a filmmaker in command of his craft and his camera, his movie successfully conveys his love and concern.Love and concern are, surprisingly, the two qualities most conspicuously absent from \\"Joe and Maxi,\\" which is about Maxi Cohen's father Joe, a well-to-do, self-made entrepreneur on the Jersey Shore who, in the course of the movie, learns he has cancer and, near the end, dies. This is not, I'm sure, because Miss Cohen does not have love and concern for her father but because as a filmmaker she and her collaborator were not able to express those feelings in any way that we can share. Because \\"Joe and Maxi\\" is all about Maxi's frequently expressed feelings, the movie has the effect of giving short shrift to everyone else, especially her father.Miss Cohen and Mr. Gold were undoubtedy photographing real family get-togethers, real anxieties and real sorrows, but \\"Joe and Maxi\\" looks like an ego trip. True doesn't look real.In the heady, home-film boom of the 60's all sorts of unlikely people took up the camera to capture truth at 24 frames per second. Norman Mailer, in a brief sabbatical from what he does best, produced three feature-length psychodramas, culminating in his \\"Gone With the Wind\\" called \\"Maidstone.\\" Andy Warhol, with the expert assistance of Paul Morrissey, pioneered a sort of impromptu fiction that might be called docu-camp. Canadian filmmaker Allan King, who made \\"Warrendale,\\" a fine, comparatively straight documentary about disturbed children, took his camera crew and more or less moved in with a married couple (both of whom happened to be failed actors) to make a film about a \\"real\\" marriage. It was called \\"A Married Couple,\\" and it looked less like a real marriage than like a couple of married actors trying their best to act like real people.Though \\"Best Boy\\" works nicely, the camera isn't a reliable tool for therapy. It keeps getting in the way. In \\"David Holtzman's Diary,\\" Jim McBride's classic send-up of the camera-mad 60's generation, the best friend and editor of the movie-obsessed hero, who is filming his own life to get a fix on it, criticizes the hero's use of his girlfriend as the girlfriend in the movie-within-the-movie. \\"She's ridiculous,\\" the friend says. \\"She's trite. She behaves melodramatically. She's just not credible.\\"\\"David Holtzman's Diary,\\" which was made in 1967, is still the last word on the so-called \\"real\\" cinema.Correction: In my daily review of \\"The Trials of Alger Hiss,\\" I mistakenly reported that Whittaker Chambers, after he left the Communist Party, embraced Roman Catholicism. He didn't. He became a Quaker.

Over the last 60 years or so, champions of the guitar, flute, trumpet, French horn, clarinet and oboe have forged paths through a world dominated by pianists and violinists, and early instruments, frowned upon as obsolete less than a century ago, have been revived and mastered. Among these, perhaps the most unusual rebirth has been that of the recorder. A precursor of the flute, the recorder flourished until the 18th century, and then fell out of favor until around 1920, when a circle of British early instrument pioneers rediscovered it.    Since then it has led a double life. On one hand, educators have seized upon the inexpensive and comparatively easy-to-learn instrument as an ideal vehicle for teaching the rudiments of music - a legitimate enough use, but one that has led many to view recorder playing as a distinctly amateur pastime. Meanwhile, three generations of recorder virtuosos have developed techniques that take their instrument far beyond amateur and classroom standards","excerpt":"and besides having established themselves among the ranks of early music specialists, these players have helped usher the recorder into modern times by commissioning new works for it. THE RECORDER HAS ITS VIRTUOSOS, TOO"},{"year":"2005","title":"EARLY BIRD. By Rodney Rothman. (Simon & Schuster, $23.) Here's hoping that Rothman has overcome his nasty fabrication habit, because if the stories and people in his new book, ''Early Bird,'' are real, he has produced a warm, wry bit of reportage. Rothman earned some ignominy in 2000 when an article he wrote for The New Yorker turned out to have fictions mixed in with its facts, causing the magazine to run an apology. That article involved his posing as an employee at a dot-com company, and in ''Early Bird'' Rodman poses again, in a way: he retires to Florida, in his late 20's, moving into a Century Village senior citizens' complex. Rothman manages to be both an observer of these strange beings about three times his age and a sad-sack newcomer trying to blend in with them. He is working a bit of a stereotype, but his descriptions of the loneliness, the cliquishness, the slow-motion desperation of the place ring true and bittersweet. Most surprising is that his tales contain not an ounce of mean-spiritedness -- this from someone who once wrote for David Letterman. ''Young people often think old people all look the same,'' he writes in a passage typical of his tone, ''but that misconception works both ways. To elderly people, young people merge into one tender pink blob. Elderly people always seem to think I am 18 or 19, which is flattering until I remember that their eyesight is failing and that a certain percentage of them suffer from dementia.'' Can't wait for the sitcom, which is already in the pilot stage.       DEMOCRACY AND POPULISM: Fear and Hatred. By John Lukacs. (Yale University, $25.) A good rule of thumb for assessing sociopolitical books is: The more often the name ''Tocqueville'' appears, the more numbing and uninsightful the work will be. There's a quote in Tocqueville's musings to support almost any view, which makes invoking them an exercise in laziness","excerpt":"and besides, how relevant can a guy be who wrote before electricity or rush-hour traffic? So it bodes ill for John Lukacs's ''Democracy and Populism: Fear and Hatred'' that the first word of the preface is ''Tocqueville,'' the first word of the first chapter title is ''Tocqueville's'' and the first two words of that first chapter are ''Alexis'' and ''de.'' But for those willing to read around or through the Tocqueville references, Lukacs, the outspoken historian, provides some satisfyingly inflammatory notions. For instance, on his way to sounding the alarm that democracy is giving way to an intolerant populism, he gleefully packs liberals and conservatives off to hell in the same handbasket: ''By about 1980 there was no overall or even significant difference in the personal behavior (including sexual habits) of liberals and conservatives, Democrats and Republicans, urban and suburban populations.'' Later comes a thought likely to set Rock the Vote types to headbanging: ''There may be room for an argument that, for the sake of proper democracy, voting should be made not easier but more difficult.'' And he offers a provocative guide to polar opposites: ''One of the fundamental differences between extremes of right and left is this: in most instances hatred moves the former; fear the latter.''

It is an old Ingmar Bergman film, made by the Swedish director some 15 or 16 years ago when he was just beginning to find his way in this medium which he has commanded with great power in recent years.It is the picture made by Bergman under the title of \\"Music in the Dark,\\" from a novel by Dagmar Edquist who also wrote the script. And the reason it hasn't found a lodging in this area until this barren time is fairly obvious from the dusty, dog-eared drama that was gingerly put on view under the artful title of \\"Night Is My Teacher\\" at the Eighth Street Playhouse yesterday.Looked at with all the love and tolerance that one can muster in these movie-meager days, it still seems a soapy little picture whose showing now is only justified as demonstration for movie-lovers on how much Bergman has improved.Its story of a blinded musician who fretfully gropes his way towards a submissive mental adjustment and happy emotional union with a fine girl is luxuriously sentimental in a romantic fashion and style more akin to early Hollywood movies than to more recent Bergman films. Dramatically, the story is loaded with heart-throbbed cliches and its few hints of social injustice toward the blind are dated by 40 or 50 years.Furthermore, the age of the picture is embarrassingly revealed by the youthfulness of its performers, many of whom are familiar in recent films.Mae Zetterling, lately so worldly with Peter Sellers in \\"Only Two Can Play,\\" is a picture of round-cheeked, wide-eyed innocence as the erstwhile housemaid who helps the hero to compliance and love","excerpt":"and Birger Malmsten, often seen in Bergman pictures, is young and earnest—oh, so earnest—as the blinded man.

One sequence, for instance, which describes the pitifully meager funeral of the father of the girl, is beautifully lean and laconic, forcasting the later Bergman skill at etching emotional situations in strong, realistic strokes.But, for the most part, \\"Night Is My Future\\" is cinematic juvenilia of a painful sort.

One explanation is that the deception began when Kate Porter sent her 14-year-old son to private school, passing him off as a prodigy of 12. Several Porter authorities, as well as James O. Cole, a first cousin once removed, say that 1891 is correct. And so reads Porter's tombstone.   The Week in Review regrets the error. We suspect that Mr. Porter, the eternal bon vivant, does not.

The department has outlined a journey from Greenwich to New London, Storrs, Hartford, other cities and back to Greenwich, with stops at 11 museums along the way in which Impressionist paintings are an important part of the collection.   Details of the Connecticut Impressionist Art Trail are contained in a pamphlet that describes each museum, the artists represented there and something about the town, its restaurants, accommodations, and the scenes that inspired Impressionist paintings.   Group tour information may be obtained by calling 800-879-4222. For other information or to obtain a pamphlet, call the nearest Convention and Visitors Bureau located in Fairfield County, New Haven, Mystic, Northeastern Connecticut, Hartford or Central Connecticut.   The museums listed are the Bruce Museum and Bush-Holley House in Greenwich, Weir Farm in Wilton, the Yale Art Gallery in New Haven, the Florence Griswold Museum in Old Lyme, the Lyman Allyn Museum in New London, the William Benton Museum at the University of Connecticut in Storrs, the Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection and Insurance Co. and the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford, the New Britain Museum of American Art, and the Hill-Stead Museum in Farmington.   Prominently featured are works of the American Impressionists including Childe Hassam, John Twachtman, Theodore Robinson, J. Alden Weir, Mary Cassatt, Leonard Ochtman, William Chadwick, Willard Metcalf and Henry Ward Ranger. But the French Impressionists are also represented along with works by American artists who followed other styles, such as Thomas Eakins, Winslow Homer and George Bellows. CONCERTS FOR A ZOO    To raise money for the Professor Beardsley Research Station, the Beardsley Zoo in Bridgeport is offering a series of summer concerts on Saturday at 7 P.M., rain or shine, with Hugh Blumenfeld.

There will be a raised platform for the professor's desk, lab counters with microscopes, artifacts, pillows to sit on that are covered with ethnic fabrics, and the air will be scented with spices.

One night at the opera, he decides he wants its beautiful star, Hsiang-chi (played by Ivy Ling Po, above left, with Kwan Shan). (''I need a concubine like you,'' he announces with military charm.) When she turns him down, he persuades her to enter a relationship with him by having her handsome boyfriend arrested and tortured. Time passes, bringing the birth of a child (Yuan believes it is his), a carefully orchestrated baby switch at the hospital, a disfigurement, a death and long years when Hsiang-chi believes she will never see her daughter again. It's a little bit ''Madame X,'' a little bit ''Show Boat,'' and either Susan Hayward or the mature Lana Turner could have done the American version. ''Vermillion Door'' is one of four films in ''Shaw Brothers Classics,'' the Film Society of Lincoln Center's three-day series, which begins today.

The studio's smash hit and cultural phenomenon ''The Love Eterne'' will be shown all three days. The film is Li Han-hsiang's 1962 fairy-tale musical about a young woman in fourth-century China who dresses as a man to get an education, then falls in love but is promised to another, leading to a wedding-day graveside finale.

He is such an expressive pantomimist and so distinctly an individual that he is bound to vivify many of his scenes. Gustave von Seyffertitz is also a screen actor whose performance gives a definite impression. To a lesser degree, the same may be said og Roland Young, Hedda Hopper, Robert Schable and several others in the cast of \\"Sherlock Holmes,\\" the photoplay at the Capitol this week. It must be added, too, that many of the scenes in the picture have been persuasively staged, some of them in actual locations in England and Switzerland and others in imaginatively designed settings. And the photography, as a rule, gives them their full value.So the photoplay has its fine points. But how does it stand as a photoplay, a unified and completed whole? All of its excellencies, in themselves, cannot make up a convincing dramatic composition. They are valuable only to serve the purpose of a definite conception which includes them all and uses them all to achieve a definite effect, the effect of the photoplay itself. So the question is, what use has been made of them? How stands \\"Sherlock Holmes\\" as a dramatic, or, if you will, a theatrical, composition? And the answer is, it falls. It falls to pieces. Only its separate elements remain. The spectator may admire these separately, if he pleases, but he cannot take them together as parts of a photoplay which convinces him and holds his interest.Not for the purpose of comparison, but to indicate the weakness of the film, it may be well to go back to the original Conan Doyle stories. These stories satisfy many readers because of their method and the stuff in them. In each there is, first of all, a mystery. It is laid down in such a way that the reader's interest is aroused. He cannot solve it, but he is curious to know how it can be solved, so he reads on, and as long as the solution proceeds logically he follows it with ascending interest. As each of his questions is convincingly answered, he eagerly asks another, and so on, until all his questions have been answered and he is satisfied. The mystery has been cleared up","excerpt":"and cleared up, he feels, in a fair, straightforward way, and the only possible way.Furthermore, the Sherlock Holmes stories are not all plot. They have characters in them. The detective, especially, is a character. He has personality, peculiarities, individual traits that distinguish him from oher men and make him interesting. He is a real figure.Now, in the film this method is lacking. The spectator is not first presented with a mystery, and he is not led, step by step, to its logical solution. There are several problems, but none of them is of compelling interest, and they are solved as much by the superior knowledge and power of the playwright as by anything Sherlock Holmes is seen to do. Sometimes it even seems as if their solution is postponed so that the film may be allowed to continue. And they are mixed up with an irrelevant \\"love\\" issue that consuses Holmes, the lover, with Holmes, the detective. The whole thing finally resolves itself into the usual melodrama in which the hero gets the villain and marries the girl.This villain, of course, is Professor Moriarity, the master criminal. But he is a master only on the strength of verbal representations. He doesn't do anything to reveal his powers. Nor does Holmes. Both are like Tom Sawyer. Each prefers to do a thing in the most complicated and circuitous way. Moriarity wants Holmes killed, but instead of having him disposed of simply and effectively, as he might have done on a number of occasions, he lays the most elaborate plans and evolves the most intricate schemes, for which no necessity is presented and from which, of course, Holmes always escapes. And when the hero's final victory comes it is not explained. Holmes states that the time has arrived when he can arrest Moriarity, but no one knows why. He talks about having obtained a chain of evidence that leads to him, but you have to take his word for it. It's nothing that the spectator can follow. For all he can see, Moriarity and his aids might have been arrested shortly after the first reel. The whole thing gives the impression merely that a lot of stunts have been strung together, some of them ingenious enough, but none of them convincing except as an ingenious stunt.And Sherlock Holmes is not characterized. John Barrymore is there, and he is interesting, but you do not feel the presence of that peculiar individual, Sherlock Holmes. This, it would seem, is not due to any failure on Mr. Barrymore's part, but rather to the fact that Holmes can be revealed only through the work he does, and in this film he is not given any adequate work to do. THE SCREEN"},{"year":"1992","title":"The streets were placid, security was relaxed and signs of protest had vanished from this big bayside city today, only hours after President Bush's brief and ill-starred stopover here. But that belied a bubbling national debate about the handling of the visit, which ended abruptly on Thursday afternoon in a stinging cloud of tear gas and the brief if distant pop of gunfire.   The city's left-leaning newspaper, La Estrella de Panama, shouted \\"Fiasco!\\" on its front page today, a noun that reflected many Panamanians' embarrassment about the collapse of the President's long-awaited trip.    Mr. Bush was forced to abandon a speech and flee under an escort with its guns drawn from Plaza Porras when the Panamanian police lobbed tear gas and fired warning shots to disperse about 200 rock-throwing protesters.    The tear gas set off a panic among the crowd of 15,000 that threatened to engulf the tractor-trailer bed on which Mr. Bush and the Panamanian President, Guillermo Endara, were seated.    Today, officials said 30 to 50 protesters had been arrested, far more than the dozen or so that the Government had estimated on Thursday. Videotape played endlessly on the city's television stations showed police chasing, wrestling and sometimes beating resisting protesters with sticks.   The television broadcasts showed that the participants included two prominent opponents of Mr. Endara's Government: Balbina Herrera, a legislator and member of the Democratic Revolutionary Party, the organ of Panama's former dictator, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega","excerpt":"and Cleto Sousa, who heads the Panamanian People's Party, a leftist organization.    But much of the reaction centered on the police, who were widely criticized for allowing demonstrators to get too close to the plaza and then using too much force to disperse them.    \\"They were absurdly close -- right on the edge of the square,\\" said Terry Ford, a Panama City businessman who got a full dose of gas.   The city's leading daily, La Prensa, accused the police of overreacting; the paper said the protesters had barely begun throwing rocks and other objects before the police charged them.    Even Mr. Endara's spokesman, Louis Martinz, said late Thursday that the panic and Mr. Bush's retreat \\"could have been avoided\\" had police kept the protesters farther away.    The national security force under General Noriega was corrupt and brutal and was abolished after the United States invasion in December 1989. The United States has promised money to help train a new police force, but the funds, which were appropriated in 1990, have not yet been disbursed.    Some Panamanians and the newspapers expressed dismay at Mr. Bush's descent on the city, accompanied by security preparations and a staged welcome by thousands of flag-waving citizens. Their major complaint, as one put it, was that it was inappropriate for Mr. Bush to come to Panama amid such a carnival atmosphere when the country had not fully recovered from the scars of the invasion.   It is questionable, however, whether Thursday's protests represent the country's real feelings about either Washington or the 1989 invasion. Newspaper polls have consistently shown that 80 percent to 90 percent of Panamanians approve of the United States military presence.    Other polls show widespread support for a continued United States presence here, even after ownership and operation of the Panama Canal is turned over to Panama in the year 2000.    Mr. Ford, the businessman, said Panama's real feelings came through when Mr. Bush's limousine and a small pack of security cars fled, roaring down a side street.    Crowds pulled out handkerchiefs and began waving them at the limousine in a spontaneous expression of friendship, Mr. Ford said. And Mr. Bush, a broad grin on his face and a microphone in his hands, boomed through a loudspeaker as he sped out of sight: \\"Thank you! Thank you!

DURING my time in Congress one of my most enlightening - and infuriating - encounters with bureaucracy came in 1977, when the Carter Administration was pressing for reorganization of the executive branch. One modest part of the President's proposal called for restructuring the Office of Human Development in what was then the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. This office administered a range of Federal programs for the handicapped, children, families, the elderly and veterans. Together these programs had an annual budget of nearly $5 billion.   When an Assistant Secretary of H.E.W. testified before the House subcommittee I chaired, the session was stormy. Again and again my colleagues and I returned to two points: the Assistant Secretary had made no substantive case that the proposed changes would improve services or save money","excerpt":"and despite public commitments to do so, the developers of the reorganization plan had failed to consult the groups affected by it or those of us in Congress who had legislative responsibility for the programs.

I had seen, partly suggested by the name, an untidy, shambling, middle-aged man with worn shoes, who might have bits of string in his pocket, and perhaps the New Statesman under his arm, exuding an air of innocence, defeat and general inefficiency. When I explained this Carol said, ''We don't want any of your character acting. Play it straight. Don't act.'' That might be okay for some wooden dish perhaps but was disastrous for me.

She stood for a long time gazing at the baggage claim area. Without being able to explain it completely to herself, she felt a twinge of uneasiness. The other passengers collected their suitcases and left. Her baggage was not on the conveyor belt, which was now empty except for the bulk of a perfectly indifferent cat.   \\"I am lonely,\\" Ivana T. said to a peasant beside her.   He lifted her in his strong arms. Her heart beat faster. \\"I am waiting for a limousine,\\" she said.   \\"No limousines come here,\\" said the peasant, pressing his lips to her lovely white throat.   \\"But this is the airport.\\"   \\"All the same,\\" said the peasant. \\"All the same. But I will take you in    my    limousine. Where do you want to go?\\"   \\"To the Trump Castle,\\" said Ivana T.  Chapter Two     \\"I won't take you there,\\" said the peasant.  Chapter Three     Ivana T. walked through the deep snow. The opening of the new casino in her homeland of Czechoslavakia was three hours away. She headed toward the Castle, but the road, which at first seemed to lead up to the Castle hill, only made toward it, and then, as if deliberately, turned aside, and though it did not lead away from the Castle, it lead no nearer to it either. Ivana T. experienced a fit of despair.    \\"Taxi!\\" she called into the empty street.  Chapter Four     My heel has snapped, thought Ivana T. She saw a shop with a sign, a cut-out of two gigantic green shoes.   \\"My heel has snapped,\\" she said to the man who looked out through the tiny window.   \\"You must have an application,\\" said the man. He closed the window. A church bell rang cheerfully. Chapter Five     \\"Darling,\\" said the skier as he schussed by. \\"So good of you to come.\\" Chapter Six     Fatigued and confused, Ivana T. entered a doorway. Round tables, with starched white cloths, stood empty and desolate.   \\"Do you have a reservation?\\" asked a man blandly.   \\"But your restaurant is empty.\\"   \\"Nevertheless, you must have a reservation. It is our custom.\\" The man nervously pushed her outside.   \\"I am going to the Castle,\\" said Ivana T. \\"I    own    the Castle.\\"   \\"Perhaps,\\" said the man, and slammed shut the door. Chapter Seven     In the telephone booth, Ivana T. tried to place a call. She reached for a coin, but her red satin evening gown had no pockets. What has happened to me? she thought. It was no dream. Ivana T. angrily dialed the operator.   \\"I wish to speak to the Castle. I own the Castle,\\" she said. Ivana T. had a shock as she heard her own voice, which had acquired a persistent horrible twittering squeak. \\"I am Ivana T.,\\" she said.   \\"What are you saying?\\" asked the operator.   The words she uttered in her new voice were no longer understandable, apparently, although they seemed clear enough to her. In the glass of the booth, Ivana T. saw a reflection. Was it really she, Ivana T.? Her hair had changed. It was very black, and short like a man's. Her ears had become quite prominent, her eyes dark and brooding. \\"Ivana T.!\\" cried Ivana T.   \\"What is that?\\" said the operator in a bored voice. \\"A novelist? What is that to me?

How many Heisman Trophy winners never played professional football?    A. Almost 15 percent of them, 8 of the 55 winners, beginning with the first three Heisman winners -- Jay Berwanger of the University of Chicago (1935), and Larry Kelley (1936) and Clint Frank (1937) of Yale. They spurned pro careers because it wasn't that attractive a way of making a living back then. The other Heisman winners who never carried the ball as pros were Nile Kinnick of Iowa (1939), Dick Kazmaier of Princeton (1951), Ernie Davis of Syracuse (1961), and Doc Blanchard (1945) and Pete Dawkins (1958) of Army.   Davis, the last Heisman winner not to play in the pros, turned professional and was signed by the Cleveland Browns, who were grooming him for their backfield with Jim Brown. But he died of leukemia before ever getting into a pro game. All of the 28 players voted the best in college football since then have taken some sort of shot at becoming the best in pro football. Heisman to Pro Glory    Q. Which Heisman Trophy winner went on to the most success as a professional?    A.  If the yardstick is membership in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, then there are four players who share the honor: Roger Staubach and O. J. Simpson, who were enshrined in 1985","excerpt":"and Doak Walker and Paul Hornung, 1986 inductees.   Staubach won the Heisman in his junior year at Navy in 1963, then played for the Dallas Cowboys from 1969-79. Five times he was rated the top quarterback in his conference and five times he took the Cowboys to the Super Bowl. Simpson, the 1968 Heisman winner from Southern California, played in the pros the same 11 years as Staubach, mostly with the Buffalo Bills, but he never made it to the Super Bowl. He made it to the top of the league in rushing four times, however, and became the first running back to eclipse 2,000 yards rushing in a season (1973).   Walker, a two-way player, was the 1948 Heisman winner from Southern Methodist University and a punter, place-kicker, running back, defensive back and kick returner with the Detroit Lions from 1950-55. In those six seasons, Walker won two scoring titles and Detroit won two N.F.L. titles. Hornung was the 1956 Heisman winner from Notre Dame, where he played quarterback, then spent nine seasons as a running back and place-kicker with the Green Bay Packers in their glory years. He led the league in scoring three times, and when he scored 176 points in 12 games in 1961, it set a mark that still stands, though teams now play 16-game seasons.   Tony Dorsett of the University of Pittsburgh (1976), Earl Campbell of the University of Texas (1977) and Marcus Allen of U.S.C. (1981) are other Heisman winners who warrant Pro Football Hall of Fame induction some day. As for Bo Jackson of Auburn (1985), the major league leader in home runs by a Heisman winner, he could wind up enshrined in two sports. Tackles in End Zone    Q. In a pro football game, if a player intercepts a pass in the end zone and attempts to run it out but is tackled before he can leave the end zone, the play is ruled a touchback and the intercepting team gets possession on its 20-yard line. What happens when a player is tackled in his own end zone on a kickoff return or a punt return before he has crossed the goal line?    A. Same ruling. It's a case of gaining by staying put, a built-in safety for one team that prevents a safety for the other. As long as the returner never leaves the end zone, he'll guarantee his team a first down on the 20. If he steps over the goal line, his team will get the ball wherever he is tackled, which most likely would be somewhere between the 1 and the 20. If he steps out of the end zone and then steps back in, the ensuing tackle in the end zone will result in a 2-point safety for the other team, as well as loss of possession for his team. Cream of 300 Crop    Q. Following up on an answer last week about the differences in numbers of victories and defeats among 300-game winners in the major leagues: which 300-game winner has the best winning percentage for his career?    A. Lefty Grove. He won exactly 300 games, was a loser 141 times, and his winning percentage of .680 not only is tops among the 20 pitchers who have won 300 games or more, but also is right up there among the leadership of pitchers who have appeared in at least 300 games in their careers.   Heading that list is Bob Carruthers (218-97 for .692), followed by Dave Foutz (147-66 for .690), neither of whom pitched after 1894. So the modern leader is Whitey Ford, the former Yankee left-hander, whose record from 1951-67 was 236-106 for a .690 percentage. Next is Grove, a left-hander who pitched for the Philadelphia Athletics and Boston Red Sox from 1925-41 and five times was a 20-game winner with fewer than 10 defeats, and the first 300-game winner after him is a right-hander, Christy Mathewson, whose 373-188 mark generated a glowing .665 winning percentage.

But when it gets close to its characters—even to the spectacularly beautiful Miss O'Neill — who talk without communicating and touch as if without ever making contact, it gives up everything to the development of a plot that makes no sense and the intimation of a lifestyle that you couldn't keep fresh even under Saran Wrap.Everything in the film leans to the conventional—the sex, the violence, the thrills, the anger, the cool.

(Temple University, $24.95.) On the morning of his departure a young emigrant named Carmine Iannace picked up his heavy suitcases and, accompanied by his father and other men from the village, walked slowly down the road toward the station to await the afternoon train for Naples, where he would later board a steamship bound for that magnetic land that the Italians called ''La Merica.'' Carmine Iannace's father, an impoverished farmer whose only asset was his family, had been devastated by his son's determination to leave","excerpt":"and even before reaching the train station the father abruptly turned around and, without a word or a handshake or a wave of goodbye, started back toward the village. The confused and saddened son, watching in tears, called out to his father. But the older man kept walking, and the only comment that followed came from one of the village men who explained: ''You are now an emigrant. From today forward you are completely on your own.'' What happened to Carmine Iannace in America at the turn of the century, together with the experiences of several other Italians who were sufficiently driven and desperate to break their village ties and their parents' hearts and to endure the abusive life at the bottom of the American pecking order, is the basis of this fine new book by Michael La Sorte. Although the author is a professor of sociology at the State University of New York, Brockport, this book is unburdened by academic language, excessive statistics and the distant view that many learned Italian-Americans take when writing about the humble life of their emigrating forebears.

But even so, yesterday's audience liked it very much indeed, and accorded to Mitzi Green, Jackie Searl and their cohorts more applause than is, in these troubled days, often given to grown-up royalty—either screen or real.Mitzi, in this case, is the child actor; and Bruce Line the child king. Were this a trifle older, Jackie could be called the comic relief, or, perhaps, just a heavy. And while comparisons of kings and queens are always difficult, the favor this time seems to lie with the lady. Mitzi does not seem to act; the others do, a little.

One view, put forward by Galileo, Francis Bacon and Newton, is that the most effective way to discover scientific laws is through experiment - by setting up controlled situations in which the basic elements of some phenomenon can be isolated and studied independently of complications. Another view, championed by literary figures such as Goethe, suggests that the direct study of almost any phenomenon in nature can lead to insights about fundamental natural laws. In the words of Tennyson: Little flower - but if I could understand What you are, root and all, and all in all I should know what God and man is.

Those looking for spurts of comedy mingled with thrills will not be disappointed. This production is well photographed and the settings and exteriors please the eye.One might say that there is a touch of originality here and there in this photoplay, which is assuredly pleasing after the Summer or fine weather pictures that have been displayed recently. But suspense is shaken out of this production, as it is too light for anything like that. Miss Daniels at times devotes more attention to acting with her hands than with her pretty face, and in one scene she has with Antonio Moreno it looks very much as if a deaf-and-dumb couple were carrying on a conversation.Miss Daniels has the part of Ronnie Rand, who by the will of her late aunt must marry before she is 21 if she wishes to inherit a fortune. The aunt contends that Ronnie needs good advice from a husband.The opening of the production gives one an idea of the speed Ronnie loves. It is a picture of a speedometer marking fifty-five miles an hour, that being the rate at which Ronnie loves to drive her car. Ever bent on going through space as fast as possible. Ronnie is shown riding the surf behind a motor boat dashing along over the waves. She happens to be engaged to Roger Patton, whose idea of maximum speed is being pushed along in a wheel chair","excerpt":"and even with this halting movement he has trouble, for the absent-minded negro one bright morning shoves Roger and the chair over the end of the jetty into the water.Because the club is too slow for Ronnie, she speeds forth in an airplane to deliver unexpected packages of good things to the poor children, convenien???y staged on the beach. She is accompanied by an unwilling minister. They come down to a height of about 300 feet and drop the prizes with such accuracy that some of them fall into the laps of persons, while others are hit on the head with them. It gives one the idea that Ronnie, or Miss Daniels, ought to be a bomber in the flying forces. They meet with an accident, and Ronnie is badly hurt, and in a moment of semi-consciousness she remembers that she must get married that day. The only available man is a burglar who has rescued her from under the airplane's wing. The ceremony is performed, and soon afterward Ronnie offers the man a bribe for the marriage certificate, which he refuses. Roger appears to be relieved at the young woman's marriage.The burglar—Pierre Martel, played by Moreno—reports to his gang that he has a chance to wheedle great wealth out of the young heiress. There are fights, in some of which Strangler Louis is introduced. He has an obsession for choking people, and every necktie reminds him it is around a throat, and his thumbs always banker to press on a man's Adam's apple.As Ronnie gets well she walks around the boudoir, perfuming it with a spray, and then settles down on a chaise-longue, practicing with a pistol on a target ???ed to a tree. It is plain that she is recovering and that, if anything, she is rather proud of her burglar husband. Comes then the dénouement in which Pierre turns out to be a detective who has only been cracking safes to solidify himself with the crooks. Ronnie is chagrined at this discovery, looks upon it as deception, a detective meaning no thrill to this speed queen. But finally she settles down to the humdrum life of a detective's bride.Burr McIntosh does what he has to do as the family lawyer in a natural and pleasing way. Irvil Anderson as Strangler Louis loses no opportunity to show the strength of his fingers. Miss Daniels is always comely, and Moreno, when he employs expression instead of gesture, is quite convincing.There seems to be a dearth of plots in the Thomas H. Ince studios if \\"A Man of Action,\\" presented at the Strand this week, is any criterion of what they have on hand. But how this particular story came to pass the various experts in the Ince studios is one of those mysteries that perhaps never will be solved. James W. Horne directed this impossible production, banking probably on the good name of Douglas MacLean to carry it through. But it would take a genius, a young and accomplished Jekyll and Hyde, to do anything with this photoplay, alleged to be \\"fast and funny\\" and characterized as a mystery comedy.One would imagine that on a hot day Mr. Ince and the director were looking out of the window when this production was made, for, according to the scenario writer, all one has to do to carry out a daring deception is to go down to the Bowery, give half an hour's study to the type that makes horizontal gestures with his hands, and then return home as a burglar in a white sweater and persist that you are not yourself.MacLean has done good screen work, and he acts well in this contraption. He plays the Part of Bruce MacAllister, who has inherited a fortune in diamond mines, and therefore has all the comforts wealth can buy. He is waked in the morning by a timid servant, while another menial obtains the temperature of his bath water. So Bruce becomes a spoiled boy. Helen Sumner (Marguerite de la Motte) is disgusted with Bruce, and tells him that if ???e wishes to marry her he must be a man of action.Eugene Preston, who holds the reins of the MacAllister fortune, schemes to steal a box of diamonds worth half a million dollars, and he tells Bruce that he had better leave San Francisco and go East to attend an important meeting. Bruce agrees to accompany Helen's father, but he arranges with Dr. Sumner for somebody else to go with him, while he stays in San Francisco. So Bruce visits the underworld and falls in with the crooks with whom Preston is working on the big robbery. One of the band asks Bruce his name, and he replies \\"Kid.\\" So of course they take him to be the famous \\"Chicago Kid.\\" In a sweater and loose trousers, he returns to his home, where he convinces Preston, without further disguise, that he is not himself but the \\"Chicago Kid,\\" and obtains possession of the precious diamonds, but loses them soon afterward.Preston insists that everybody stay in the house until the gems are recovered, and the little box crops up in the hands of various persons, in scenes that are somewhat mindful of \\"One Exciting Night.\\"Helen, surprised at seeing the house lighted up, calls in the police. She does not recognize Bruce. Everybody looking at the picture wonders why. He has not even let an eighth of an inch of stubble grow on his chin. And he is about to be locked up when Helen's father returns and explains that Bruce did not go with him. The real diamond thief turns out to be the \\"Chicago Kid,\\" who Just before the story opens had obtained work as a butler in the MacAllister home. Oh, yes! Then happy Helen announces to police, father and everybody that Bruce has become a man of action.It is not very often that one sees such a piece of nonsense as this, even in motion pictures, and why it should adorn the screen of the Strand is inexplicable.The cast is quite capable, Mr. MacLean is pleasing and Miss de la Motte does her best.Other Photo Plays.At the Capitol, \\"The Ragged Edge,\\" with Alfred Lunt, Mimi Palmeri and others.

Ivan Reitman did, and he lived to talk about it.    Mr. Reitman told Mr. Schwarzenegger he wasn't going to direct \\"Kindergarten Cop.\\"    Just like that.     But of course, when you go see the new movie, starring Mr. Schwarzenegger as one very tough Los Angeles cop who goes undercover as a kindergarten teacher to catch a psychotic killer in in Astoria, Ore., you just may notice that Mr. Reitman's name is listed as the director. And as a co-producer.   But he really did say no.    \\"It started almost exactly a year ago,\\" said Mr. Reitman, who directed the \\"Ghostbuster\\" movies and produced and directed \\"Twins,\\" starring the big Mr. Schwarzenegger and the little Danny DeVito as the unlikely siblings. It seems that Universal Pictures had been developing the script of \\"Kindergarten Cop\\" and sent it to Mr. Schwarzenegger, who was then smashing heads and zapping creeps on 21st-century Mars in the course of making \\"Total Recall.\\"    Mr. Schwarzenegger suggested that the studio forward the script to him, Mr. Reitman said, \\"because he told them he would do it if I would do it.\\"   \\"I think he liked the 'Twins' experience,\\" Mr. Reitman said. \\"I think it expanded him as an actor, and it expanded him as a movie star.\\"    Mr. Reitman said he read the \\"Kindergarten Cop\\" script and turned the project down. \\"After I read it, I said: 'This is wonderful.' I told Arnold Schwarzenegger he should do it. This was wonderful for him. I wasn't sure it was the thing I should do next in my career. The screenplay was not at the point the final movie reached. It basically played on the concept really hard, but it didn't have any of the secondary themes, some of the more serious points of the film: the strong family stories, the broken home, the child abuse and even the romance weren't there.\\"    But Mr. Reitman said: \\"They sort of kept hammering away at me, the studio and Arnold.    \\"Arnold doesn't take 'no' very well.\\"    \\"The way I usually get involved in films,\\" Mr. Reitman told Universal, \\"is that I work on the screenplay a long time and either get seduced by it or I don't. I said I would be prepared to produce the film for now, that I would develop the screenplay and make the decision on directing it later. If I didn't direct it, I would find a director and help guarantee it creatively for Arnold, watch over it.\\"    So work proceeded on the screenplay, credited to Murray Salem, Herschel Weingrod and Timothy Harris","excerpt":"and eventually, Mr. Reitman said, people began telling him: \\" 'Come on, do it. It's great.' I just finally relented. I got all kinds of directors calling me, and that's when I realized I had to do it myself.\\" So toward the end of spring, he went to work, filming \\"Kindergarten Cop\\" on a 60-day schedule in Astoria and Los Angeles.    \\"I like comedy, obviously,\\" he said. \\"I've done it a lot. I like it because I seem to see the world that way, that even relatively serious subjects can be told in a comedic manner.\\"  Back to the Megaphone     Taylor Hackford is trading in New Visions for new visions.    After some two and a half years devoted to the producing side of his producer and director personality, Mr. Hackford, whose credits as producer and director include such films as \\"An Officer and a Gentleman,\\" \\"Against All Odds,\\" \\"Everybody's All American\\" and \\"La Bamba,\\" is writing finis to the story of his New Visions Pictures company and returning to directing.    But the company, which functioned as a small studio, leaves a legacy.  There is Richard Pearce's \\"Long Walk Home,\\" a story of the 1955 bus boycott in Montgomery, Ala., starring Sissy Spacek as a prosperous housewife and Whoopi Goldberg as her maid. And in the pipeline, Mr. Hackford said, is a handful of other films scheduled for release in 1991, including:    *\\"Queens Logic,\\" a comedy-drama about a reunion of a group of friends in their 30's who came of age during the 1970's. The cast includes John Malkovich, Joe Mantegna, Kavin Bacon, Jamie Lee Curtis, Ken Olin, Linda Farrentino and Tom Waits.   *\\"Defenseless,\\" a Hitchcockian thriller starring Barbara Hershey, Sam Shepard and Mary Beth Hurt.    *\\"Sweet Talker,\\" made in Australia and starring Bryan Brown and Karen Allen in a comedy about a con man who gets his comeuppance in a rural town.    *\\"Mortal Thoughts,\\" with Demi Moore, Glenne Headly, Bruce Willis and Harvey Keitel in a psychological thriller-black comedy about two women who are friends and who find themselves involved in a deadly situation.    Mr. Hackford said he expected to be back to directing by March, on \\"Blood In, Blood Out.\\"   \\"It's a Chicano gangster story,\\" said Mr. Hackford, who was born in Santa Barbara, Calif. \\"It's actually more than that. It follows three Chicano gang members, starting in the 70's, who grow up in Los Angeles.\\"    In the course of 15 years, the script by the poet Jimmy Santiago Baca and Jeremy Iaconne tracks the friends as one goes to prison and becomes involved in organized crime; another becomes a police officer and the third becomes a talented artist.    \\"To me, this is the first California gangster picture,\\" Mr. Hackford said, asserting that other gangster films \\"all emanate from the same subject.\\"   \\"Whether Irish, Italian or Jewish,\\" he added, \\"they all come out of immigration in the last century.    \\"This,\\" he said of \\"Blood In, Blood Out,\\" \\"is a film based on fact and revolves around the sleeping giant that exists in the Southwest, our Latin population.\\"    Mr. Hackford, who has a credit as an executive producer on \\"The Long Walk Home,\\" said he decided to give the project the green light because the script by John Cork \\"approached a now historical subject in an intelligent fashion, from a point of view.   \\"Too often films about racism take the position that you can explain racism by saying people have an I.Q. of 3.\\"   But in \\"The Long Walk Home,\\" he noted, the story is told from the point of view of two families, one white and one black, but principally the white one. \\"They are intelligent, moderate people,\\" he said. \\"It's always more frustrating when you find people have all the accouterments of intelligence and civilization, and then they have this block. I think that's the complicated nature of racism. I thought that's why that particular film would be an interesting film to make.\\" 5 in Festival     Five films, each selected by its country as the official entry for an Academy Award nomination for best foreign-language film, are to be shown during the second annual Palm Springs (Calif.) International Film Festival from Jan. 9 to 13.    The films are \\"Taxi Blues,\\" from the Soviet Union; \\"Ju Dou,\\" from China; \\"Open Doors,\\" from Italy; \\"Requiem for Dominic,\\" from Austria, and \\"Diary for My Father and Mother,\\" from Hungary.    In all, more than 60 films are to be shown during the event. Lens, Not Pens     Mark Peploe, who collaborated with Bernardo Bertolucci on the Oscar-winning screenplay for \\"The Last Emperor\\" and who teamed up with the Italian director again to write the scenario for Mr. Bertolucci's sumptuous new \\"Sheltering Sky,\\" has traded pens for lens.    As scribe turned director, Mr. Peploe is in postproduction on \\"Afraid of the Dark,\\" starring Fanny Ardant, James Fox, Ben Keyworth and Paul McGann. It's a psychological thriller.    \\"I love thrillers,\\" Mr. Peploe said. \\"Nearly everything I write, whether it is a love story or a piece of history, I tend to speak of them in terms of thrillers.\\"    Mr. Peploe, who directed documentaries before turning to screenwriting, traces his debut as a feature film director to a film he didn't make.    \\"I've been trying for 12 years to make a particular movie, another one, and along the way, friends said, 'Why don't you try to make something simpler, something at home,' \\" he recalled. \\"Everything I've made has been some kind of a road movie. There's nearly always travel involved.\\"    So, Mr. Peploe said, he sat down and wrote an appropriate screenplay. \\"I deliberately set out to write something frightening,\\" he said, \\"and I succeeded certainly in frightening myself, and in a way it is a very disturbing story because it is about fear.\\"    \\" 'Afraid of the Dark,' \\" he said, \\"is a story about a 10-year-old boy, and it takes place in two parts. It is partly subjective and partly objective. Hitchcock could have made it. I would like to think he would have liked the plot.\\"    It seems that a sadistic attacker is preying upon the blind. And despite assurances from his father (Mr. Fox), the boy (Ben Keyworth) is becoming concerned for the safety of his blind mother (Miss Ardant). But as his fears intensify, the child becomes uncertain of where his disturbing daydreams end and reality begins.    Mr. Peploe said \\"Afraid of the Dark,\\" filmed in London, should be in distribution (by New Line ) in the summer at the earliest, but more likely in the autumn.    En route to becoming a feature film director, said Mr. Peploe, who said he hoped to continue writing and directing, \\"I learned to believe in movies and to believe that movies can make a difference: that they're worth making, that they are the greatest product of the age, that you can bring two things together, make a commercially successful film and a work of art.\\" At the Movies"},{"year":"1985","title":"WILLIAM MARSHAL.

The seemingly permanent reconstruction of the Prospect Park Zoo in Brooklyn and the Flushing Meadows-Corona Park Zoo in Queens has reduced the nonaquatic offerings of the New York Zoological Society to a single, if justly famous, pair. But when it comes to seeing wild things, the Bronx and Central Park Zoos are not the only game in -- or at least near -- town. Indeed, within the arc of an hour's travel from midtown Manhattan, more than a half-dozen zoos or animal parks can be found. \\n\\nGranted, none of these suburban zoos have the scope to be found in the Bronx","excerpt":"and few have a setting to rival that of Central Park. What they \\n\\ndo \\n\\nhave is distinct identities. From Ripley's Believe It or Not bizarre to English-garden austere to pet-shop cuddly, New York area zoos pretty much cover the gamut of the different ways people have dealt with the world's creatures. In fact, it's been a good decade or two since the major thing distinguishing one zoo from another was its size, with every collection of cages trying to be a mini-National Zoo. In those days, almost every zookeeper wanted, as Tim Gunther, director of the Bergen County Zoological Park in New Jersey, puts it, \\"One from column A and one from column B.\\" A touch of Asia here, a dash of Africa there, and, mirabile dictu, you had a zoo.\\n\\nOf course, in some suburban locations that still gives you a zoo. But others have joined the trend toward biomes, getting rid of their existing scattershot collections in favor of animal displays that focus on a single region. And more have begun seeking the respectability of membership in the American Association of Zoological Parks and Aquariums (A.A.Z.P.A.), which examines zoos for cleanliness, care of animals and competence of personnel.\\n\\nWhat follows is the natural history of seven area zoos and animal parks. And while a lot about them is different, one thing hasn't changed much: the designated audience. Most New York suburban zoos began as children's attractions, and youngsters are still the main focus. That means zoo trains, pony rides and fast food vie with the wolves and monkeys and bears for attention. And it often means things can get wild in more ways than one. \\nStaten Island Zoo\\n\\n\\n614 Broadway, West Brighton, S.I., (718) 442-3100. Open 10 A.M. to 4:45 P.M. seven days a week\\n\\n\\n, except for New Year's Day, Thanksgiving and Christmas.\\n\\n\\nAMBIANCE: At first glance, the Staten Island Zoo looks like an Ivy League college; the cobblestone entrance walk is lined not with cages but with carefully tended gardens, and the main buildings have ivy growing up over their red brick facades. The zoo itself maintains this 19th-century, museumlike air. The best sights are inside the enclosed main halls, which contain an aquarium, a serpentarium and the new Tropical Forest display, and are cool and dimly lighted even at midday. A great place to relax and, like a library, inimical to loud noises. Once you leave the main buildings, though, there's not much to see. Most of the mammals -- the lions, panthers, chimpanzees, wolves -- have been moved to other zoos while the Staten Island zoo undergoes renovation, giving part of it a slightly abandoned air.\\n\\nHISTORY: Staten Island always seems separate from the other New York boroughs, and its zoo is no different. This is the only zoo in the city not run by the New York Zoological Society; it is operated by the Staten Island Zoological Society. But this zoo is proud of its past, which shows in its setting. The Staten Island Zoo opened in 1936 as one of the first educational zoos in America.\\n\\nA.A.Z.P.A. APPROVED: Yes, and has been for some time.\\n\\nSTROLLER QUOTIENT: Fairly high. Though in some ways it would seem better suited for adults, the zoo is filled with children, many of them barely ambulatory. Maybe the parents are hoping their offspring will learn something by osmosis. \\n\\nANIMAL STARS: The snakes have it. Fourteen varieties of rattlesnake and a couple of boas that look as if they could stretch the full length of Central Park.\\n\\nFOOD: Basic snack stuff with a few surprises: knishes and nachos. Also offers a \\"critter meal\\" for children that includes animal crackers and a racoon mask to wear while eating them.\\n\\nZOO TRAIN: No. Considering the size of the zoo, a bare eight acres or so, and the fact that the best things to see are indoors, a train would be superfluous.\\n\\nPETTING ZOO: Yes, a nice one, though the exhibits are predictable (ducks, deer, goats, etc.). Also offers a pony ride outside an ersatz Kentucky Derby barn.\\n\\nBEST TIME TO VISIT: Since the best exhibits are indoors, time isn't as important here as at most zoos. The reptiles are fed at 3:15 P.M. on Sundays, though, which makes them more active then.\\n\\nEDUCATIONAL VALUE: Should be higher. Many of the plaques on the displays are hard to read, and most give only the animal's name. Something about habitats and habits would be nice.\\n\\nADMISSION: $2 for children ages 3 to 11 and $3 for ages 12 and up; free for children under 3. If that's too much, the zoo is free from 2 to 4:45 P.M. every Wednesday.\\n\\nHOW TO GET THERE: From Staten Island Ferry take S-48 Bus to Forest Avenue and Broadway. Turn left on Broadway, walk two and a half blocks to zoo entrance. By car, take the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge to Interstate-278 West to Slosson Avenue Exit. Turn right on Slosson, continue to Martling Avenue, turn right, and continue to Clove Road. Zoo entrance ahead, free parking to right.\\nBergen County Zoological Park\\n\\n\\n216 Forest Avenue, Paramus, N.J. (in Van Saun County Park), (201) 262-3771. \\n\\n\\nOpen\\n\\n\\n10 A.M. to 4:30 P.M. daily.\\n\\n\\nAMBIANCE: Oversize pet store. With one or two exceptions, everything here seems cute and cuddly. Paved paths wind among open air displays of guanaco, deer, peacocks, spider monkeys and the like. Everything is spiffy and admirably maintained, but it also feels perhaps too manicured. With the exception of the mountain lion exhibit, there's not much of a sense of the wild to be found here.\\n\\nHISTORY: In the 1960's and 70's, the zoo was, in the words of the zoo director, Tim Gunther, \\"an entertainment, a few exotics such as macaws and parrots and then a number of domestic animals in nursery rhyme settings, the sort of thing that makes me gag thinking of it today.\\" In the 80's, prompted by a couple of lawsuits, the zoo cleaned up its act, brought in professional management, sold off most of its existing collection, and began shaping itself as a North American-South American animal exhibit. It has shaken its \\"postage stamp\\" past. \\"Like many zoos of the time,\\" says Mr. Gunther, \\"we used to want one example of everything, the stamp collection approach, rather than having animals that related to each other.\\" But the Bergen County Zoo has yet to shake other elements of its history, specifically its reputation as a kiddie display.\\n\\nA.A.Z.P.A. APPROVED: Yes, one of only two in New Jersey that is. The other is in South Jersey, in Cape May.\\n\\nSTROLLER QUOTIENT: As might be expected, enormous. Scream and yelp quotient is up there as well. On one midsummer day, the number of males above the age of 10 could be counted on one hand; all others were mothers and children.\\n\\nANIMAL STARS: The spider monkeys always draw a crowd, but the best in show is probably the North American Wetlands exhibit, a self-contained display of what might be found in, say, a Louisiana swamp.\\n\\nFOOD: Nothing in the zoo itself, but next door is Van Saun Park's food pavilion. If you remember the food you got in summer camp, this will be familiar.\\n\\nZOO TRAIN: Yes, from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. Tuesdays through Sundays. Cost is 50 cents, and that gets you about a five-minute look at the backside of the zoo. Not bad if you're into fences. Otherwise, hardly worth it.\\n\\nPETTING ZOO: Not really. There is a replica of a Bergen County Farmyard, circa 1860, separated from the rest of the zoo by a stream, and the farm has horses, cows and sheep that can be touched. But rather than something distinctly different, it just seems an extension of the rest of the zoo's atmosphere.\\n\\nBEST TIME TO VISIT: As with most zoos, mornings and late afternoons are best. In the hot midday, animals like to find some place cool and rest, as should most reasonable people.\\n\\nEDUCATIONAL VALUE: Disappointing, except for the wetlands exhibit. As open and accessible as the zoo is, and as geared to children, one would hope for more information at each of the displays. The zoo tries at the Spider Monkey pavilion and elsewhere, but it has a long way to go.\\n\\nADMISSION: Free on weekdays; on weekends and holidays, $2 for adults 19 to 61, $1 for those over 61 and children 12 to 18, free for children under 12.\\n\\nHOW TO GET THERE: From the George Washington Bridge, take Route 4 west to Forest Avenue. Take the off ramp and bear right. Travel one-quarter mile to Van Saun Park and follow signs to the zoo. About 20 minutes from the George Washington Bridge.\\nTurtle Back Zoo\\n\\n\\n560 Northfield Avenue, West Orange, N.J., (201) 731-5801. Open 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. Mondays through Saturdays; 10:30 A.M. to 6 P.M. Sundays and major holidays.\\n\\n\\nAMBIANCE: Theme park meets the open plains. The Turtle Back Zoo is actually two zoos in one: the original facility, which is housed behind a set of English Tudor-style buildings and features small enclosures, and the new outer perimeter, which is fenced-off fields and natural habitat. Since the entrance to the zoo is fronted by a huge parking lot (which connects to the nearby South Mountain skating rink), and the first impressions are of concrete and tourist-trap decor, the walk to the open edges of the facility is a revelation. It probably wasn't intended that way, but it works as a transition from a manmade world to a natural one.\\n\\nHISTORY: The Turtle Back Zoo, opened in 1963 as a part-year children's zoo, has become something of an icon to many from New Jersey. This is where they had birthday parties or came to torment the birds. Not the sort of thing the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals would like, but a good reminder of how the attitude toward zoos has changed in recent years. Parts of the original zoo can be depressing, especially the murky, algae-filled turtle display. (One would expect more to be done for the namesake reptiles.) But the general good cheer of the employees, and the admirable new exhibits, make up for a lot.\\n\\nA.A.Z.P.A. APPROVED: No, although the zoo is working toward approval. A new veterinary hospital now under construction is expected to help.\\n\\nSTROLLER QUOTIENT: Medium. This may have started as a children's zoo, and it may still be a favorite birthday spot (there were 13 separate parties held here one recent Sunday and some people book their party times a year in advance), but the mix of adults and teen-agers balances things out.\\n\\nANIMAL STARS: The curators talk up the turtle exhibit, which is actually disappointing. The real star is Wolf Woods, the new wolf exhibit in which a series of Plexiglas panels look out on a field through which the wolves romp.\\n\\nFOOD: Decent and plentiful. There's a main dining pavilion with the standard fast-food fare and a couple of snacking outposts to keep the children content.\\n\\nZOO TRAIN: Yes, though \\"nature train\\" might be a better description. A milelong loop of track runs through woods at one side of the zoo. Not much in the way of animals, but the ride is free with admission to the zoo, and it's pleasant enough.\\n\\nPETTING ZOO: Sort of. There's a small spot known as the \\"contact area\\" where children can manhandle a few domesticated animals.\\n\\nBEST TIME TO VISIT: Sundays are jammed, and Saturdays only a bit better. Try for a Friday afternoon or, failing that, early arrival Saturday.\\n\\nEDUCATIONAL VALUE: Pretty good, surprisingly. For an extra $1.34 (including tax) you can buy a plastic zoo key that turns on recordings at most of the exhibits. (The key is yours to keep, and can be used on return trips.) Placed inside metal storybooks, the recordings are generally accurate and often entertaining. A number of them are narrated by Leo Sylvester, a longtime Turtle Back employee, and his heavy New Jersey accent adds a certain personality and charm to even the most banal information.\\n\\nADMISSION: $6 for adults; $2.50 for children 2 to 12 and people 65 and older; free for children under 2.\\n\\nHOW TO GET THERE: Take Garden State Parkway to Exit 145; get on Interstate 280 heading west to the Oranges and exit at Exit 10, Northfield Avenue. Turn left and travel about three miles to South Mountain Arena. Zoo entrance is behind the arena. \\nTerry Lou Zoo\\n\\n\\nTerrill and Raritan Roads, Scotch Plains, N.J., (908) 322-7180. Open 10 A.M. to 4 P.M. Mondays through Fridays; 10 A.M. to 6 P.M. Saturdays and Sundays. \\n\\n\\nAMBIANCE: Ripley's Believe It or Not. The first thing you see after buying your ticket in a small, circular silo is a shadowy hallway replete with spider webs and boasting a glass display case filled with skulls -- gorilla skull, buffalo skull, etc. -- and a full-fledged chimpanzee skeleton. It's an appropriate introduction to a very strange place. After that the zebrony, a sterile offspring of a zebra and a pony, and the Georgia O'Keeffe display of cow skulls in a turkey and chicken enclosure seem right at home.\\n\\nHISTORY: In the 1950's and 60's places like the Terry Lou Zoo proliferated along America's highways. At that time few people gave much thought to animal rights; the more displays you could jam into a single spot, and the larger the variety of those displays, the better. It was zoo as enshrined circus. Time and favor have passed such zoos by and there are only a few left. The owners of the Terry Lou Zoo are well aware that they're in opposition to the animal Zeitgeist of the 90's; hung on the wall near where you buy your ticket is a poem castigating animal activists (who are reminded of Genesis, Chapter One, and the statement that God gave man dominion over animals) and a description of how the Terry Lou Zoo actually saved the life of many of its animals, taking in a wounded eagle no other zoo wanted or a lion cub found wandering the streets of Manhattan. It would be touching were it not so obviously defensive. \\n\\nA.A.Z.P.A. APPROVED: No, and probably not in this lifetime.\\n\\nSTROLLER QUOTIENT: Low, thankfully. Though there is a distinct Dada-esque appeal to the place, it's not really the way you'd like children to learn about the animal kingdom.\\n\\nANIMAL STARS: Not one standout, though to be fair, many people want the lion-zebra-elephant mix offered here more than the habitat-conscious, geographically limited mix found in the newer small zoos. The circus is still popular.\\n\\nFOOD: Two vending machines that one should avoid.\\n\\nZOO TRAIN: No, although there are pony rides around a small pond. Cost is $2, and the rides begin at noon.\\n\\nPETTING ZOO: No. But deer wander the paths and seem tame enough to touch.\\n\\nBEST TIME TO VISIT: Any time at all. It's about the same morning or night.\\n\\nEDUCATIONAL VALUE: Actually, not any worse than a lot of more respectable zoos. The identifying plaques are generally correct in the animal names and their ranges. Too, the entire zoo is an education, though not necessarily in the way the owners intend.\\n\\nADMISSION: $6 for adults; $3 for children 1 to 12.\\n\\nHOW TO GET THERE: Take the New Jersey Turnpike to Exit 14A, Newark Airport. After passing tollbooth, take Highway 22 going west. Follow for about 20 miles to Terrill Road in Scotch Plains. Turn left onto Terrill Road and travel three miles to intersection with Raritan Road. Turn right; zoo is immediately to right.\\nLong Island Game Farm Zoological Park\\n\\n\\nChapman Boulevard, Manorville, L.I., (516) 878-6644. Open 10 A.M. to 5\\n\\n\\nP.M. daily through Oct. 14. After that, it is closed until mid-April.\\n\\n\\nAMBIANCE: At first, this seems like a Boy Scout camp, replete with wooded walkways and pine shingle construction, but when you get to the heart of the park, you see what it really is: Animal Disneyworld. There's even a barn near a farmyard display that warbles songs from \\"Peter Pan.\\" Then there's Bambiland, where you can wander among the deer population; Buffalo Prairie, roamed by bison named Buffalo Bill and Calamity Jane; Thumperville U.S.A., a rabbit pen; Affection Section, a display of baby goats and sheep, and, well, you get the idea. The physical and psychic center of the Long Island Game Farm is a collection of carnival rides. The animal displays radiate out from here, and are much less well attended than the carousel. (All of the rides, except a new giant slide, are included in the admission.) That's too bad, because the variety -- zebra, camel, black bear, llama, vervet monkey -- is pretty good.\\n\\nHISTORY: A Long Island fixture for more than two decades. The rest of the world may change, but some things remain the same.\\n\\nA.A.Z.P.A. APPROVED: No point in it.\\n\\nSTROLLER QUOTIENT: Decent, but lower than might be expected. Much of this is better suited for older children, a number of whom probably never see a single animal in an afternoon's worth of rides.\\n\\nANIMAL STARS: Undoubtedly the Bengal tigers, which appear in the Thomas Tiger Show, a three-times-daily comedy animal act. The trainer and star, Harry Thomas, is a combination of Clyde Beatty and Willard Scott, with more of the latter than the former.\\n\\nFOOD: Lots, most of it greasy, sweet, or both. The standout is the churro, sort of an elongated Mexican doughnut.\\n\\nZOO TRAIN: Yes, a six-minute sweep around the outside of the park complete with a tape-recorded narration that occasionally fails to match up with what you're seeing.\\n\\nPETTING ZOO: Bambiland, the Affection Section, and Old MacDonald's Farm all qualify.\\n\\nBEST TIME TO VISIT: One time of day's about as good as another.\\n\\nEDUCATIONAL VALUE: Distinctly mixed. There's decent identification on most of the exhibits, but one has to wonder at a place that informs its visitors that buffalo once numbered in the millions on the Great Plains but \\"dwindled to a mere thousand by 1889.\\" Dwindled? Well, yes, thanks to a general slaughter by buffalo hunters.\\n\\nADMISSION: $11.95 for adults; $8.95 for those over 65 and children 2 to 11; free for children under 2.\\n\\nHOW TO GET THERE: Take the Long Island Expressway to Exit 70. Turn right. Entrance is a few miles down on the left.\\nThe Animal Farm\\n\\n\\n184A Wading River Road, Manor\\n\\n\\nville, L.I., (516) 878-1785. Open April through October, 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. daily.\\n\\n\\nAMBIANCE: Your favorite uncle's farm. There are Vietnamese potbellied pigs, sheep, ponies, birds, foxes, cows, chickens, rabbits, ducks, ferrets, cats and the like, all placed in wired enclosures or corrals spread over a pleasantly rolling Long Island landscape. The atmosphere is clean, pleasant, and well tended, though more domestic than zoolike, which is not surprising, considering that many of the animals on display were once pets.\\n\\nHISTORY: The Animal Farm was founded in 1984, in part to provide a place for people to drop off their unwanted pets. The displays have become a bit more exotic as yuppiedom expanded to the pet world (thus the ferrets and potbellied pigs), and the Animal Farm is starting to expand out of the pet world (it recently added some Himalayan tahrs, a type of goat), but the single word that still describes the place best is \\"cuddly.\\" \\n\\nA.A.Z.P.A. APPROVED: No, although the A.S.P.C.A. would undoubtedly like it. \\n\\nSTROLLER QUOTIENT: Mammoth. Actually, by the time a child is old enough to enter school, he may find this a trifle boring.\\n\\nANIMAL STARS: None, really, although the display of pets that have been dropped off and are looking for a home (one of the services offered by the Animal Farm) can be heartbreaking.\\n\\nFOOD: Basic hot dog and ice cream fare.\\n\\nZOO TRAIN: Two -- the Caterpillar Train and the Turtle Train -- neither big enough for a child older than about 5, and neither going around the zoo. Like the Lollipop Driving Course, the Sand Play Park, and a line of bucking rides near the entrance, these are simply rides.\\n\\nPETTING ZOO: Are you kidding? The whole thing is a petting zoo.\\n\\nBEST TIME TO VISIT: Mid to late afternoon. Animal shows are at noon, 2 and 4 P.M. Since everything is out in the open, it can get stifling in the noon sun.\\n\\nEDUCATIONAL VALUE: Minimal. The animal shows do their Mr. Rogers bit to help, but there's not much to see or read at the displays themselves.\\n\\nADMISSION: $8 for adults; $6 for children 2 to 16 and people 55 and over; free for children under 2.\\n\\nHOW TO GET THERE: Take the Long Island Expressway to Exit 69. Turn right; entrance is 2.5 miles on the right. \\nBeardsley Zoological Gardens\\n\\n\\n1875 Noble Avenue, Bridgeport, Conn. (in\\n\\n\\nBeardsley Park), (203) 576-8082 or 576-8126. Open 9 A.M. to 4 P.M. daily.\\n\\n\\nAMBIANCE: Under construction. The heart of the zoo, the old bird and mammal building, has been ripped apart and is being rebuilt as a South American Tropical Rain Forest Exhibit. It should be nice when it finally opens, but in the meantime the zoo has a feeling of being incomplete, of all edges but no center. A paved path circles around the construction and passes by wolves, bison, llamas, antelope, black bear, mountain lions and even a trio of Siberian tigers, but the lack of a core gives these the sense of an afterthought.\\n\\nHISTORY: Bridgeport is where P. T. Barnum once lived and exercised his animals by walking them along the streets of the city. The sight of these exotics may have stimulated the desire for a zoo, which opened in 1922 and which, in the 1950's, was singled out by Look magazine as one of the nation's most modern. What was state of the art under Eisenhower, though, is old hat now, and the zoo's keepers admit theirs is a zoo in transition.\\n\\nA.A.Z.P.A. APPROVED: Yes.\\n\\nSTROLLER QUOTIENT: Fairly low. There's not a lot for toddlers here.\\n\\nANIMAL STARS: None, really, though the red wolves and the Siberian tigers are probably at the head of the list. The real star will be the Rain Forest, and everyone seems to be waiting for it.\\n\\nFOOD: Basic french fries and hot dogs, dispensed from a small wooden stand.\\n\\nZOO TRAIN: No. There is, however, a pony ride that operates from 10 A.M. to 3 P.M. and costs $1.\\n\\nPETTING ZOO: Yes, and perhaps the best thing here. Since it's self-contained, the petting zoo doesn't seem in limbo like much of what surrounds it. The exhibits are varied, the displays are good, and it can be jammed when the rest of the zoo seems deserted.\\n\\nBEST TIME TO VISIT: As at most zoos, early morning and late afternoon, when the animals are most active, is best.\\n\\nEDUCATIONAL VALUE: Fairly good in the petting zoo and disappointingly low elsewhere. A couple of the major displays in the main zoo have no identification of any sort to be found. You have to guess at the animals and where they're from.\\n\\nADMISSION: $5 a car for out-of-state cars to enter Beardsley Park. Zoo admission is $3.75 for adults; $2 for those over 60 and children 5 to 12; $1 for children 3 to 4; free for children under 3.\\n\\nHOW TO GET THERE: Beardsley Park is between the Merritt Parkway and Interstate 95. From I-95, take Exit 27A to Route 25 and follow to Exit 5, Bridgeport. Take a left off the exit and go four lights to Noble Avenue. Turn left; zoo entrance is one-quarter mile on left. From the Merritt Parkway, take Exit 49S to Route 25 and follow to Exit 5, Bridgeport. Take a right off the exit and go five lights to Noble Avenue.

It is surprising but not unnatural, when you come to think of it, for the kids have obviously profited by their experiences in the past and are now, presumably, anxious to grow up quit talking gutter.But society and the Warners are apparently not yet ready to let them off. For no sooner are the chastened youngsters graduated from reform school than they are popped into the hideous Hudson Shelter (known familiarly as Hell's Kitchen), where they fall under the brutal discipline of a hypocritical, chiseling superintendent. Stoically the boys endure a lot of grievous Oliver twists, such as vile food, hard work and frequent torture — until modified salvation comes in the person of an ex-racketeer who wishes to show his good works and justify a parole by assisting with the management of the shelter.As it happens, the previous associations of this scrupulously honest gentleman lead to considerable difficulties—some comical, some grimly real.

A decorated member of the NYPD and veteran of the United States Armed Forces from 1941-1945, Mr. Alcindor received three commendations for outstanding police work as a patrolman in 1961 and then as a lieutenant in 1966 and 1978. In addition, he was awarded a medal at City Hall by New York City Mayor Abraham D. Beame. An avid musician, Mr. Alcindor brought his talents on the trombone to the New York Transit Authority Police Band, even playing at the 1962 Democratic National Convention. His musical talents also led to his involvement in one of the most famous events in U.S. history, as Mr. Alcindor was in attendance as a band member when Marilyn Monroe serenaded President John F. Kennedy with ''Happy Birthday'' at Madison Square Garden on May 19, 1962, an event, according to his son, he never forgot. Born in Brooklyn, NY, Mr. Alcindor attended Franklin K. Lane High School where he teamed with legendary Knicks coach Red Holzman on the school's handball team that captured the city championship. He followed that up by attending the Juilliard School to pursue his career ambitions of becoming a musician. Hopeful of one day playing with the Count Basie Band, Mr. Alcindor enjoyed working with some of the musical giants of his time, including Dizzy Gillespie, Art Blakey, Kenny Durham, Al Gray and Tito Puente.

Decidedly, something went agley. For it had a workable story, a good cast, a fine director and all the technical skill that the Columbia studio could contribute.

Weakening once again, this corner drops \\"The Captain Hates the Sea\\" into the \\"Grand Hotel\\" classification, under the subdivision: \\"At sea.\\" Which means, in substance, that the new film presents a cruise ship with its assorted human cargo. weaves some sort of a thread about them and brings them home again.

(It sounds complicated, but that's what happens.) And some are tragic, as was the death of the general who was going back to his country to lead a revolution. And some are just dull, as trying to understand what Mr. Gilbert is supposed to be doing.But when it is all over and the film fades out with a parting shot of the captain, still glowering, on the bridge, the audience finds itself right back where it started from and not too happy about where it had gone.

Our first-hand knowledge of Mr. Pinnock comes from his harpsichord recital here a few months back, and then there are the recordings - especially a stunning collection of the Bach keyboard concertos which Mr. Pinnock and the English Concert made for the Archiv label.   Friday's concert - with the exception of Purcell's Suite from ''The Fairy Queen'' - limited itself to a single generation of Baroque composers, but within these compressed boundaries lay a remarkable range of style and personality. Purcell's mood swings were wide - from a ''Monkey's Dance'' bursting with high spirits to a grave and extended Chaconne at the end. Albinoni's D minor Concerto for Oboe and Strings (Op. 9, No. 2) was more relaxed - its soothing symmetries never threatening our piece of mind and rarely challenging our imaginations. Still, the lovely middle movement, with its gentle monotony and long melodic lines, had an irresistible appeal. MUSIC: ENGLISH CONCERT"},{"year":"2003","title":"DAMBRA -- Joseph Paul.

His portrayal of a self-sacrificing porter in a Rome high school is not forceful but merely broad and transparent while a supporting cast and the camera contribute occasional bits that outshine the star's best efforts. In short, the parts of this uneven drama are far better than the whole.Fabrizzi, in this instance, is a sort of unlettered Mr. Chips, who, conscious of his ignorance and low estate, is determined that his orphaned son, nicknamed \\"the professor,\\" will do better in life via fine education. Through hard work, self-denial and some skulduggery he not only gets that background for his offspring but also has him transferred to his own school. His pride and happiness are short-lived.For, though the student body has a genuine affection for the old porter, their good-natured jibes prove awkward for both porter and professor. So, as a final gesture of love and altruism, Fabrizzi, quietly leaves both his son and the halls of learning which have been his home through the years.In unfolding the story in flashback from 1919 to the present, the cameras comment neatly on politics in Italy by focusing on the constantly changing pictures in the office of the Minister of Education. The producers also have drawn finely etched vignettes from Mario Soldati, as a veteran Latin instructor who is suddenly transferred to an outlying school because of his rugged individualism","excerpt":"and from Raffaele Caporilli, as Fabrizzi's stolid, faithful and practical assistant.

Not So Dumb Animals"},{"year":"1933","title":"NOT that we stand in desperate need of comedies. This merry season has already consoled us with \\"Sailor, Beware!\\" \\"Her Master's Voice\\" and \\"The Pursuit of Happiness,\\" whose only mission is laughter. But Laughter, which has been sore distressed upon several occasions recently, will have to hold both his sides in the presence of Howard Lindsay's \\"She Loves Me Not,\\" which rattled the dusty timbers of the Forty-sixth Street Theatre when it opened there on Monday evening. No doubt there have been comedies as ebulliently funny as this one in the carnival neighborhood of Times Square, but after sitting down quietly the next morning to recover my thoughts I cannot remember another that has seemed quite so full of merriment. It is spontaneous, guileless and tumultuous. It is pure comedy. Those of us who slipped a cliché about satire into our panic-stricken notices the next morning were not choosing our words wisely. For \\"She Loves Me Not\\" is no more satiric than those picaresque, tun-bellied comedies entitled \\"Tom Jones,\\" \\"Tristram Shandy\\" and \\"Peregrine Pickle.\\" You can roar at it without feeling contemptuous of the volatile folk who race through it.WHEN two or three clever young writing men are lounging over a few drinks late at night in the pot-houses of this town ideas for heroic comedies and scenes for gargantuan tumbling are frequently invented and delivered gratis to the tobacco smoke and the bartender. Some of the grandest yarns that have never been written live and die in airless taverns. \\"She Loves Me Not\\" has the tang of one of those midnight fantasies. Edward Hope, quondam columnist of The Herald Tribune, first wrote it as a novel that bore the same title. Since then Howard Lindsay, who has been trouping, directing and scribbling for years, has adapted it into a comedy and translated it into a robust theatre raree-show. Let us not underestimate the value of the theatrical stuff he has crowded into it. He has set the stage with two major platforms, representing upstairs and downstairs in a Princeton dormitory—or almost any other place for that matter","excerpt":"and from tiny cubicles in the wings he keeps the action whirling through diverse quarters of North America. Expressionistic or constructivist settings, or whatever you choose to label them, have been employed to add a touch of bogus gayety to dramas that were grave at heart; and, if memory still serves its purpose, J. P. McEvoy's \\"God Loves Us\\" scrambled across a similar kind of framework when it was produced several years ago. But Mr. Lindsay is the first director to digest these flexible stage ideas. As the scene designer, Raymond Sovey, has been ingenious enough to add a little realistic illusion to the construction. The result is eminently practicable; the two stages add considerable scope and fluidity to the rag-tag and bobtail of Mr. Lindsay's story.THE story is fabulous. It begins innocently enough with the dilemma of Curley Flagg, a night club tap dancer, who has been witness to a gang murder. To escape both the police and the gangsters she flings a cloak over her dancing costume and flies by bus as far as her money will take her. Fortunately for Mr. Hope, Mr. Lindsay and light-minded theatregoers, it takes her as far as Princeton, where two seniors chivalrously purpose to conceal her. That is risky business in any well-bred university. To protect themselves from disciplinary action by cynical members of the faculty, the students dress her like a boy, invent a story to account for her presence and solemnly agree to keep the whole affair secret. And after the fashion of excitable young men they broadcast their secret by taking into their confidence the two other inhabitants of that entry, the president of a motion-picture company, who is the father of one boy, and a Middle Western financier, who is the uncle of another. That is where they make their mistake. In less time than it takes to write it Princeton is a bedlam of motion-picture photographers, sensational reporters, gunmen and Communists. There is something particularly funny about imposing the vulgarity of the world upon a cloistered community. The authors of \\"She Loves Me Not\\" appreciate that. The thick-skinned greediness and impudence of the photographers and reporters and the pallid wrath of the dean make for good slapdash comedy. Once vulgarity gets in, good breeding becomes helpless, and the notorious affair of Curley Flagg leaves Princeton at her mercy.THE Lord knows we have enough funny comedies in our theatre. Usually they bustle with satire; they select a victim and then pummel him. What distinguishes \\"She Loves Me Not\\" is the hearty relish the authors have for all the characters whose destinies they pack into four days. They enjoy their whole gallery. They enjoy Curley Flagg's complaisant reversion to type as soon as she finds herself sequestered among college men, for Curley believes in direct action and cannot understand the vast complexity of educated ideals, tastes and ethics. They enjoy the rogueries of the cinema press agent who sees the publicity value of a chorus girl rusticating in a Princeton dormitory and bowls over deans and gunmen to exploit it. They enjoy the ingenuity with which the Communists transform the Curley Flagg affair into a capitalistic plot.BUT what the authors enjoy most of all are the two students who nearly wreck their careers in the cause of quixotic adventure. For Paul Lawton and Buzz Jones are fine lads with a limitless capacity for enthusiasm. Give them the ghost of an idea, during the weary grind of final examinations, and they are willing to close their books with a frightful report and plunge headlong into conspiracy. The conspiracy gets beyond them. It involves them in wild situations. But like noble crusaders they ride bravely on, asking for no quarter from deans, uncles or fiancées. If \\"She Loves Me Not\\" is the funniest of the theatre's current escapades, it is because Mr. Lindsay and Mr. Hope before him like every inhabitant of their madhouse and like the flavor of humanity.As a rule, centrifugal comedies of this kind have no time to waste on subtleties of character; the most you can hope for is swift and glib performing. But in spite of the pace some of the actors in \\"She Loves Me Not\\" grace their parts with portraiture while they are riding the comic whirlwind, and Polly Walters is immense. She has a fine sense of character; she is also incorrigibly unny. No one who has once seen it is likely to forget the grotesque humors of the bacchanal she dances in a suit of floppy pajamas. There is joy in this sort of galumphing gambol. It has no relation to anything else.

But \\"Women Without Names,\\" which came from Italy to the World Theatre yesterday, is, for all of its realistic approach, closer to Hollywood's minor \\"big house\\" melodramas than it is to the tragedy and misery inherent in its theme.Although the nameless women incarcerated in these detention camps speak and epitomize the unvarnished truth, their case histories only occasionally are moving. And though the backgrounds of prisons at Farfa Sabina and Bari are pictorially authentic, only a few of the inmates emerge with great clarity.For this one must of necessity point to Geza Radvanyi, the Hungarian producer-director-writer, who previously—in \\"It Happened in Europe\\"—treated with compassion the plight of those hordes of children left homeless by the war. This time, however, his unfortunate principals are not as fortunate. Call his approach to his subject too episodic for proper impact. But the story he is unfolding opens an interesting vista which never fully resolves itself into a complete picture.His cast is a cross section of that motley legion without \\"documents\\" who were rounded up at the end of the war. There is Anna, a Yugoslav widow who saw her liberal husband shot in Trieste. Then there is the \\"Countess,\\" a Belgian who had been married to a German nobleman last heard of in the final siege of Berlin. There is also Yvonne, a cheerful and cynical Gallic lass, whose morals are varied","excerpt":"and good and bad Germans and Italians. In short, the barracks are crammed to capacity with types who should have piqued the interest of most.However, their assignments are not visualized wholly. This is a strangely stylized microcosm out of which, now and again, striking use is made of camera and dialogue. There is, for example, the plight of Anna, desperate to have her child born into freedom, who is shown bearing her infant assisted by her mates, while, in counterpoint, other members of the camp are putting on a loud and brassy entertainment. There are brilliantly stark shots of the town and its people as some of the prisoners, escorted by a sympathetic guard, visit the dentist. And there is the straightforward dressing down given the prisoners by the commandant. A resolute gent, he sadly reminds his surly charges of the futility of escape since \\"every country of Europe\\" has closed its gates on them.As the ill-fated Yugoslav, whose child is accepted by the decent guard, Valentina Cortesa is a sensitive and harried victim of the times approaching her great trial with dignity and restraint. Although she has been seen in a number of films here, none of these portrayals surpass her effort here. Simone Simon is, by turns, gay, flippant and strong as the French girl who finally inveigles a lascivious Albanian \\"sweets\\" merchant into marriage to obtain those cherished identity papers.Francoise Rosay turns in a solid portrayal as the Countess who declaims with passion against \\"politics\\" which have put her into her stateless position. And, Gino Cervi, as the lonely guard who accepts the baby; Gina Falkenberg, as a prisoner who befriends Miss Cortesa; Vivi Gioi, as an inveterate Nazi who is poisoned by her barracks mates after a trial; Mario Ferrari, as the commandant, and Irasema Dilian, as a Polish internee, contribute competent bits.They speak, it might be noted, English, French, German, Italian and Yugoslavian. But despite some of the performances, what they have to say generally is lacking in impact. Although there is an inkling of a happier future, little else, with the exception of the fate of a few, is resolved. As a whole picture, \\"Women Without Names\\" is not equal to some of its parts.

The Board of Directors, volunteers, and staff of United Cerebral Palsy Associations and its 149 affiliates nationwide, and the United Cerebral Palsy Research & Educational Foundation, acknowledge with great sorrow the passing of Jack Hausman, beloved founder of UCPA. His magnanimous heart, resilient spirit and vision continue to make a tremendous difference in the lives of thousands of children and adults with cerebral palsy and other similar disabilities. Faced with a world without adequate services for their son, Peter, who was born with cerebral palsy, Jack and his beloved wife, Ethel, joined forces with Leonard and Isabelle Goldenson, Nina Eaton, and other parents to demand medical care as well as services and supports in 1948 to assist their children in living full, productive lives. Their local efforts grew into a national movement with hundreds of families joining forces to create a national organization, United Cerebral Palsy Associations. Today, UCPA is one of the largest health non-profits in America with a network of affiliates providing advocacy, services and supports to children and adults with cerebral palsy and other disabilities to assist them in leading full and productive lives in the community. Their efforts also founded the United Cerebral Palsy Research & Educational Foundation, dedicated to medical research to enhance the quality of life for individuals with cerebral palsy. Our deepest sympathy to his sons Richard and Michael, his brother Leo, and to the entire Hausman family. The United Cerbral Palsy family will greatly miss this truly generous and visionary man.

The Officers, Board of Directors and staff of United Cerebral Palsy of New York City, are deeply saddened by the passing of Jack Hausman, a founder and beloved leader whose achievements include the creation of UCP/NYC, of United Cerebal Palsy Associations, our national organization with more than 150 affiliates nationwide, and of the UCP Reserarch & Educational Foundation. Jack and Ethel Hausman's middle son Peter was born with cerebal palsy. In 1946, they joined other parents for the simple purpose of raising funds to purchase medical care for children. Working with Leonard H. and Isabelle Goldenson, and others, they built UCP into one of the largest health agencies in the US and the leading provider of services to children and adults with cerebal palsy and related disabilities. Jack Hausman mobilized and inspired thousands of volunteers, including many influential and powerful individuals from Princess Diana to several presidents, earning enormous respect and admiration worldwide. His generosity and untiring efforts have helped to change the lives of thousands of people with disabilities. We extend our deepest sympathy to his brother Leo, President of UCP/ NYC, to his sons Richard and Michael, and to all the Hausman family. Edward R. Matthews Executive Director Ronald J. H.

We note with great sadness the passing of Jack Hausman, a Founder, a philanthropist, business and community leader who played a key role in establishing North Shore University Hospital as a premier health care institution in the Long Island region. His dedication and commitment to our institution were driving forces in our growth and development. His enthusiastic philanthropy inspired many others to support North Shore and other worthwhile causes to which he donated his energy and time. He remained active and concerned throughout his life, supporting patient care and educational initiatives at North Shore University Hospital. His concern for children inspired him to actively support the Hausman Department of Pediatrics and the Ethel and Jack Hausman Lectureship in Pediatrics at North Shore. He also established the Jack Hausman Professorship in Pediatrics. His life was a true example of caring, giving, leadership, and friendship to all. He sincerely believed in doing the most good for the most people for the right reasons. On behalf of the North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System, we extend our deepest sympathy to his family.

GETTING A LIFE: Stories, by Helen Simpson. (Vintage Contemporaries, $12.) These acerbic British tales, populated by suffering housewives and harried working mothers, are resolutely unsentimental about the mixed blessings of the mommy track.

A journalist who covered politics for nearly 40 years as a correspondent, Washington Post editor and Newsweek columnist casts a tough, principled eye on the inner workings of the capital.

This film was directed by Raymond Bernard, son of Tristan Bernard, the well-known author. It is essentially a spectacular production, as the actual story is told too deliberately at the outset, so much so that it is confusing. But this first half of the gigantic task is saved by a battle sequence with knights in armor and their crude, primitive methods of attack.It is a wonderful picture in many respects, for nothing like the scenes in which the wolves make their attack on a few of the opponents of Louis XI, has been seen on the screen. This is emphatically a vivid and exciting episode, as the wild animals sweep on to the players with such realism that women in the audience were more affected than we have beheld them at any shadow entertainment. One saw the snarling beasts, uncovering their fangs apparently ready to sink their teeth into anybody but little Jeanne Fouque, who had been left kneeling and praying in the deep, untrodden snows. The Duke of Burgundy's followers had beheld the sight of the savage wolves calmly surrounding the bent form of the girl, one of the animals actually licking her face","excerpt":"and had deemed it a miracle.One man had fallen through the ice and soon he and the others were attacked by the wolves, who from a perfect calm had changed suddenly into a vicious fury. In two or three instances the beasts grappled with the players, hurling them to the ground, and with wide open jaws lunged for the men's throats. One man's hand was in the mouth of a wolf, while another beast held a player's arm. It is decidedly the most realistic scene of its type that has ever been pictured, and to some in the audience, it was a relief when it was ended.The narrative takes place in the fifteenth century when Louis XI., the crafty, old, superstitious ruler, who enjoyed a game of chess more than anything, was at odds with Charles of Burgundy, whose loyal knight, Robert Cottereau, was desperately infatuated with Jeanne Fouquette, who afterward became known through her resistance of the attackers of Beauvais, as Jeanne Hachette, because she wielded a battle axe with precision and effect.Carcossone, the old walled city, was used in this picture to represent Beauvais. It has been done with wonderful results, and with the aid of the French Army in the old-time costumes and horses in picturesque trappings, it makes a glorious spectacle. There is a certain suspense in this chapter, as the besiegers make their terrific assault in awe-inspiring numbers while relief troops from Noyon are galloping to the aid of Beauvais. Countless riders and men afoot are employed in the attack, and Jeanne Fouquet, like a Joan of Arc, calls upon the women to aid in repelling the Burgundians. The Duke's energetic troops make a magnificent onslaught. They are seen running along the plains with their weapons, their battering rams, their ladders, going helter skelter until they reach the walls of the city. Men climb the ladders the second they have placed them against the fortress, and some are seen tottering and falling to the ground below, while more fortunate ones manage to get a foothold and engage the enemy.The troops of Noyon are gallantly hastening to the rescue, but it looks dark for the King and his fortress. Before Louis XI, is his chess board, which on the screen fades out into the contour of the map of France. Louis is quiet, with a curious mannerism of lifting only the left side of his cruel, thin-lipped mouth. Chess or no chess, he is nervously awaiting word of the battle's result. Eventually the good news comes by messenger, and one could see that Louis, who had experienced a war or two in his day, was palpably relieved by the fact that his head was safe upon his shoulders.Yvonne Sergyl of the Odéon impersonates Jeanne Hachette. She is astonishingly fine in her portrayal of the heroine. Charles Dullin gives emphatically the best characterization of Louis XI, we have seen on the screen. Robert Cottereau was played by Romauld Joube, who was much too theatric in his style. Vanni Marcoux of the National Opéra was not a happy selection for the rôle of Charles the Bold.\\"The Miracle of the Wolves\\" had the distinction, last November, of being the first picture to be screened in the Paris Opéra, when the President of France, the Premier and many distinguished persons viewed Mr. Bernard's first presentation dealing with what he terms anecdotal French history.The English subtitles in this picture appear to have been written hurriedly, and they may be in a measure to blame for the vagueness of the story. The producer has also attempted to put too much into this film instead of telling one interesting episode coupled with his romance, and the result is bewildering to the spectators. It would have been infinitely preferable to exclude some portions of this tale and some of the characters so as to clarify the narrative. The fade-outs are also too prolonged, and while one is stirred by the battle sequences and those with the wolves they only just atone for the lethargy of the romance.

And unless one gets with it at the outset, seeing it as a loose pictorial poem or a free-form cinematic expression in which virtually any whim goes, including whimseys in the dialogue and music, one is almost certain to get lost.That is to say, Mr. Jutra, who originally shot this film as a private 16-mm venture in 1962, is using the cinematic medium in the freest and most fluid way to project the varieties of experience of this young man through the sweep of this affair with a beautiful Negro model who becomes the creature and the victim of his whims.He is scanning the moods of this young fellow, his real behavior, his random fantasies (which frequently merge with his behavior so that it is often hard to be sure what is fantasy and what is real)","excerpt":"and he is throwing them all together—with incidental interludes of pantomime and sudden bits of extraneous or marginal action—to give a sense of the sort he is.Some of it is engrossing—original, imaginative and streaked with such spontaneous insights or intimations as only the camera, smartly used, can give. A sudden shot of the fellow enfolding the head of the woman in his arms, absorbing her in his physical person, smothering her pigmentation, renders the screen aglow with knowledge of the man's sensitivities in this affair. Or a telephone scene in which he tells her they are through, while bulldozers shriek outside and a building is torn down, gives the feeling of the willful demolition of their love. Here his essential meanness and shallowness are nailed.What is original about it is the way it completely overlays a conventional dramatic situation—the rise of a love affair and its fall, when the woman finds she is pregnant and the man abandons her—with the egotistical obsessions and self-indulgences of the man. What is provoking about it is the way the man holds the center of the screen, obscuring revelation of the woman, until one grows a bit impatient and bored with him.This is the more annoying because the woman, a professional model named Johanne, is a beautiful, supple, young person who plays her role with superb intuitiveness. She fairly quivers with a glowing sensitivity in every scene she plays. But, unfortunately, we learn little more about her than that she is sensitive—and subject to whims.Mr. Jutra is a protean performer. That's the least you can say for him. He acts himself in a hundred manifestations, including one as a homosexual. (This being an avant-garde picture, he probably had to work that in.) And he handles the camera and direction with such inventiveness and flexibility that it's a wonder we haven't heard from him with a picture made subsequent to this.His rhetorical style in the narration, which is spoken in English, is ornate—a little too much so for my taste, though that may be intended to imply the pretentiousness of the young fellow—but the French dialogue is bright and glib, and the English subtitles generally witty. The musical score by several composers has glittering range, as wide and imagistic as the visuals.\\"A Tout Prendre\\" is certainly not a picture for an average conventional taste. It is also as amoral as nature. But it is one the swingers and all the buffs will have to see it.

His name is T. N. Thompson, private operative who concludes each case in a blaze of glory and a burst of profanity from the San Francisco detective squad. In the fast and furious person of Edmund Lowe, the newest of the Vance-Chan-Mason line is making his bow to Times Square in an amiable excursion into homicide called \\"Mr. Dynamite,\\" at the Roxy.Mr. Dynamite—you might as well get used to the name, because no one calls T. N. Thompson anything else—is the creation of Dashiell Hammett, who wrote \\"The Thin Man.\\" Mr. Hammett's distinction among mystery tale spinners is that he never takes his corpse as seriously as his detective","excerpt":"and he never lets his detective take himself seriously at all.The three or four corpses in the picture and Mr. Lowe lend themselves agreeably to this technique. When Dynamite meets a body he doesn't go prowling around looking for fingerprints; instead he steals the clues and uses them later to show up his pet foe, the chief of detectives. He regards his clients as fair game and bills them heavily for office supplies, such being a handy term for ermine wraps for his feminine stooge and accomplice. Reprehensible—as some one has said—is the word for Mr. Dynamite's private detecting.At any rate, there's no cause to complain about the death rate in the new picture. The first to go is a young unknown who has won $10,000 in a gambling casino. He is machine-gunned on the casino grounds, which is no end embarrassing to the proprietor, one Mr. Lewis. Next to depart is Jarl Dvorjak, concert pianist, whose demise occurs in the presence of Mr. Lewis's attractive daughter. The Lewis family now is completely embarrassed, particularly since the police are inclined to be unpleasant about it, too.In desperation—it had to be that—Lewis calls in Mr. Dynamite to prove to the world that even a gambler draws the line somewhere—specifically at murder. Dynamite uses his wits and his tongue, in about a 50-50 proportion, and cracks the case. But not until two other whiteskins have bitten the dust.A racy, toughly written tale, the picture has all the advantages of swift pace, a capable cast and a compact story. Mr. Lowe proves again that, given the lines, he can play them with any man. Jean Dixon is excellent as his verbally hard-hitting assistant.

One of his assistants called it ''a very odd shell - denoting the abode of a very odd fish.'' But the few people who frequent it would prefer to call it a tour de force of amenity and ingenuity. Not only is it a prodigy of architectural invention within a comparatively small space, it is a complete and genuine museum, an arsenal of ideas, that is to say, of which every single one has kept its powder dry.   Soane's ideas have not gone out of style, either. On the contrary, his ability to range at will among the idioms of the past has suddenly come into high fashion. If there is such a thing as a postmodernist sensibility in architecture, Soane pioneered it. He had a dandy's appreciation of the past, and in his relation to it he was also one of the great impersonators.

The contentious scientist Thomas Henry Huxley (1825-95) helped usher in the modern age by fighting ferociously to shape Darwinism into a social engine to overthrow the structures of Victorian society. This ''luscious and smart biography,'' selected by the editors of the Book Review as one of the best books of 1997, features ''writing on science as lucid and engaging as one is likely to find,'' James R. Kincaid wrote in these pages.    Paradise  By Toni Morrison. Plume, $13.95.    Ruby, Okla., population 360, is an imaginary utopia settled by black freedmen where the inhabitants live in safety and peace but in complete isolation. Starting in the 1970's, the grimly righteous Ruby begins to rot from within, and the townspeople point fingers at a group of women living in an abandoned convent just outside the town, paving the way for a violent confrontation. '' 'Paradise' . . . is an ambitious, troubling and complicated piece of work, proof that Toni Morrison continues to change and mature in surprising new directions,'' Brooke Allen wrote in these pages last year.    Paul Marchand, F.M.C.  By Charles W. Chesnutt. Princeton University, $14.95.    This novel by an African-American whose fiction was widely praised in the early years of this century focuses on the inner struggle of a Louisiana man who is raised to think of himself as of mixed race but who discovers as an adult that he is white. In 1998 our reviewer, Arnold Rampersad, praised the book's ''vibrant intelligence.''    Hen Frigates:  Passion and Peril, Nineteenth-Century Women at Sea  By Joan Druett. Touchstone/Simon & Schuster, $14.    The title of this unusual nautical history refers to ships with captains' wives on board. These hardy women reared children, coped with domineering husbands and even performed crucial navigational duties in a pinch. Last year our reviewer, Holly Morris, admired ''the author's knowledge and enthusiasm.''    A Scientific Romance  By Ronald Wright. Picador USA, $13.    The hero of this first novel stumbles onto H. G.Wells's time machine in modern-day London and zooms off to A.D. 2500, where he finds the Thames flowing through steaming everglades and a city in ruins. ''The result is a fresh take on an old formula -- the dystopian postapocalypse novel,'' John Vernon said here in 1998.    Keys to the City: Tales of a New York City Locksmith  By Joel Kostman. Penguin, $10.95.    As an emergency locksmith, the author is well placed to peek into other lives and the mysteries of human nature. ''Kostman's keyhole perspective . . . is incongruously funny,'' Eric P. Nash wrote here in 1997. ''His stories are a celebration of commonplace strangeness.''    Some Lie and Some Die  By Ruth Rendell. Vintage Crime/Black Lizard, $11.    In this Inspector Wexford mystery, a body is discovered at a pop music festival in Britain and all signs point to a monstrously arrogant rock star. ''Rendell, in her quiet way, can shake mountains,'' Newgate Callendar wrote in the Book Review in 1973. ''She has a keen insight into character.'' The same publisher has reissued several early Wexford novels, including No More Dying Then ($11), which, characteristically, is part police procedural, part character study, this time involving the kidnapping of a child in a small town. ''She writes like a dream, and she never lets the tension down,'' Callendar wrote here in 1972.    Red Lobster, White Trash and the Blue Lagoon:  Joe Queenan's America  Hyperion, $12.95.    The author sentenced himself to one year of forced exposure to the hacks, hangouts and heroes of American pop culture. Though the targets are depressingly easy and the litany is occasionally tiresome, ''Queenan's razor-sharp rebukes can be appreciated by anyone who has done time in an elevator, supermarket aisle or dentist's office,'' Lance Gould wrote here last year. Going Out: The Rise and Fall of Public Amusements, by David Nasaw (Harvard University, $16.95), is a scholarly analysis that tracks the shift from urban-oriented public amusements in America to suburban venues. ''Nasaw . . . unearths fascinating details about everything from the early history of the movies to pre-World War I dance crazes","excerpt":"and he raises fundamental questions about the web of connections joining commercial play, public space and cultural cohesion,'' Jackson Lears said here in 1994.

His mirth caused other persons to look around. There are 15,000 motion picture theatres in the United States, and this film may be shown in a few thousand of these houses; hence there will be surely several thousand men or women who may laugh at Mr. Shefford's quick wit.But it does not alter the fact that the continuity in this film is so bad that it is practically impossible to follow the story. It is merely a series of scenes in which Mr. Shefford's adventures are told and a heroine is dragged in to lend sympathetic support. She is impersonated by Anne Cornwall, who is comely. There is the familiar barroom scene in which women wer décolleté gowns to breakfast. One also sees Indians in their war regalia, and in one scene the courageous Shefford slips from his fleet steed and, quick as a wink, throttles a redskin. He then disguises himself in the Indian's leather jacket and feathers, not forgetting to rub his fingers on the dead man's war paint and transfer the pigment to his own cheeks.

He goes on to point out that he has been ''a bad husband and a fickle lover,'' that he ''can't remember ever having been at peace with myself, except for brief spells,'' that he has ''inherited some bad genes.''

A POET who fashions an extreme individual style, as Robert Bly surely has done, may find he has forged his own manacles to a limited means of expression. Whatever his subject or emotions, his poems may melt together in a monochrome haze. The ostensible subject of ''Loving a Woman in Two Worlds'' is romantic love, but many of the poems - even those containing the phrase ''man and woman'' - are hard to distinguish from Mr. Bly's other poems of landscape and mystic reverie. The verses become creatures of a habit not necessarily their own. The problem is aggravated by the kind of idiom Mr. Bly has fabricated. So many lines weighted with reverent pauses, stolid with monosyllables, muffled by end stops, can make poems not suggestive but stonily incommunicative. There is too much easy Orientalism, as in ''The Turtle'': Rain lifts the lake level, washing the reeds. Slowly the milkweed pods open, the yellow lily pads.

Just what rules of court procedure permit even such a defendant as Mrs. Ames to make a personal plea to a jury in a murder case are not revealed, but the attractive Mrs. Ames, by that means and others, wins an acquittal verdict that is delayed only long enough to permit the twelve good men and true to lunch at the State's expense.Assistant District Attorney Matt Logan, convinced that Mrs. Ames had killed her husband despite the jury's findings, earns himself a slap in the face from the fair defendant and a jail term for contempt by saying so in open court. He is bailed out by the unpredictable widow and accepts her offer of $25,000 if he can prove her guilt, the idea being that Mrs. Ames hopes he may uncover the real killer in his investigations, and thus clear her name and reatore to her the son whose mind has been turned against her by that unfeeling mother-in-law, Beulah Bondi.The dolichocephalic Arthur Treacher, who always looks like a reflection in a Coney Island mirror, provides one of the film's most amusing interludes when, as the austere butler Griggsby, he plays the part of the corpse in Logan's re-enactment of the murder.The ultimate solution of the crime is not the most airtight case in the world, but further court procedures are obviated when the culprit, confronted with the flimsy evidence of guilt, leaps out a window to death.Throughout the film Eddie Brophy as a news cameraman and Alan Baxter as a typical screen reporter provide considerable antic byplay as they pursue the sleuthing Mr. Brent hither and yon. As the attorney for Mrs. Ames in the murder case and against her in the custody hearings, Alan Mowbray seems to be the only one concerned in the legal doings who has any notion of the proper procedure in such affairs. Richard Carle, as Mrs. Ames's Uncle Gordon, is appropriately spluttering and indulgent, and Scottie Beckett, as Bobby Ames, proves to be just what we had suspected all through the film—Cupid in disguise.

It's not just the exotic subject matter that makes these books feel so baroque; it's Mrs. Rice's whole sensibility and use of prose.

Reading ''The Vampire Lestat,'' in fact, is a lot like spending an entire day in a museum featuring only works by Henry Fuseli - all hung in heavy, gilt frames decorated with curlicues and malicious cherubs.

Her father, Edmund Lillienstern, died when she was nine, and she came to the United States at age 13, with her mother, a U.S. citizen by birth. Eva spoke no English when she arrived, but became fluent in the language by the time she finished high school and went on to Barnard College. During WWII, she completed the program at Columbia-Presbyterian School of Nursing, worked for a year at the Hospital and then began a long association as a public health nurse with the Visiting Nurse Service of New York.

She lived with her young family for a time in London, St. Louis, and New York City before moving to Garden City where she resided for the past 38 years. As a proud homemaker, she was a devoted wife and a loving mother to her sons. She was admired for her sharp wit and her directness","excerpt":"and her significant contributions to school, church and community, coupled with a strong sense of loyalty and fairness, endeared her to all who knew her.

These were roles she relished, both for the pursuit of causes she judged to be just, and to express more fully the camaraderie she felt with her colleagues. After retirement, she resumed all those activities which her declining health allowed. She was a prodigious reader, a prolific writer and a devoted gardener. She was also a talented cook who was wellknown for the Stollen and an endless variety of cookies she baked and distributed every Christmas.
