Screen: 'The Third Key'","excerpt":"British Import Opens at Sutton Theatre"},{"year":"1950","title":"\\"For Them That Trespass,\\" which opened at the Little CineMet yesterday, is a British film with but one claim to notice, that we can see. It is the first film in which the British actor, Richard Todd, ever appeared, before his excellent performance of the Scottish soldier who was doomed to die in \\"The Hasty Heart.\\" It is, in fact, the picture which earned for Mr. Todd the latter role. No doubt, there are some admirers of the young actor who would see it on this account.Otherwise, \\"For Them That Trespass\\" is a drab and dreary little film which we're afraid will do nothing to foster the reputation of Mr. Todd. For it is one of those misty, mood-soaked dramas about a chap who spends fifteen years in jail for the murder of a Cockney street-walker which he doesn't even commit. And in it Mr. Todd is bleakly piteous as this poor chap, whose misfortune only proves that a man can be grievously injured by another's cowardice and the vagaries of fate.Plainly, Alberto Cavalcanti, who directed this homily on life, had more interest in the gauzy construction of mood than of strong emotional plot. His shots of smoky barrooms and cobbled streets that glisten in the rain are much more affectionate and artistic than his turgid dramatic scenes. This is not surprising since Cavalcanti has proved himself to be a much better documentary maker than director of fictitious films.Evidence of this is also in the fustian performance of other roles and the oddly old-fashioned composition of the story and even of scenes. Stephen Murray is down-right atrocious as a well-bred English cad who, while \\"slumming\\" as an embryo writer, witnesses the murder but hasn't the nerve to tell. Rosalyn Boulter is quaintly reminiscent of a Mack Sennett bathing girl as the done-in street-walker, and Patricia Plunkett is utterly mawkish as a nice young thing. Indeed, if it weren't for the presence of Mr. Todd's face on the screen, the sound track might be eliminated and this picture passed off as a silent film. That, as we think more upon it, might be the truly generous thing to do.
