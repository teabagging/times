A mixture of operetta, burlesque and science fiction are in it, too, so that the sum total of the presentation is fantasy and cinema gone wild. Its value as entertainment is in the pleasing parts rather than the whole.The notion is that the premier of Austria suddenly proclaims that the country should be independent of so-called Four Power control. Immediately the country is visited by representatives of the Global Union, who arrive with their lady president in space ships, flying saucers and rubber suits. Their purpose is to try the nation for being an habitual aggressor and presumably to declare it banished from association with the world.But once the trial is started the Austrian Premier puts forth such overwhelming evidence of the amiableness and charm of the people and the land that the charges are gracefully withdrawn and the nation's prestige is restored. Even the biting misgivings of the lady President of the Global Union is overcome and she is easily persuaded to marry the handsome and susceptible Premier. Whereupon the whole thing is discovered to be an elaborate dream.In Austria this sort of fooling may have considerable appeal, as may the cast, which includes Josef Meinrad as the Austrian Premier and Hilde Krahl, as the lady President. But for patrons outside the orbit of Austria's domestic concerns, the political satire and fictionizing will more likely seem tediously contrived. Enjoyable are the Viennese waltzes and the handsome pictures of the Austrian countryside, the reflections of the nation's checkered history and the tributes to its potent wines and beer.

In the case of the 31-year-old Austrian conductor Franz Welser-Most, for instance, who is making his New York debut leading the New York Philharmonic for two weeks, the back of the Avery Fisher Hall program booklet carries an EMI-Angel advertisement displaying not one but four Welser-Most recordings.

The first of Mr. Welser-Most's programs, heard Friday afternoon and scheduled for the last time tomorrow evening, is shy in grandiose orchestral showcases, but that diffidence may suit his predilections, and even the marketing strategy behind his career. On the basis of this one outing, Mr. Welser-Most, who took over the London Philharmonic this season, appears more an introverted patrician than an extroverted populist.

Their fleeting convergence in an intimate Off Broadway playhouse is a theatrical event not likely to recur anytime soon.   For the young Mr. Dean, the destination may be stardom. Though little known, he has revealed an impressive range in supporting roles on stage (as a teen-age hustler in Paul Zindel's \\"Amulets Against the Dragon Forces\\") and screen (an affluent high-school kid in \\"Say Anything\\"). Now, as show-biz fate would have it, he is coming to prominence by playing variations on the same leading role -- a Bronx boy confronting manhood -- not only in Mr. Shanley's play but also in the movie version of \\"Billy Bathgate,\\" which opens next week.

IDENTITY: Makeup artist. AGE: 32. RECENT PROJECTS: Fashion Week spring shows for Isaac Mizrahi, Donna Karan, DKNY, Richard Tyler for Anne Klein, Ralph Lauren, Todd Oldham","excerpt":"author of \\"The Art of Makeup,\\" (HarperCollins, 1994; $60). PAST CLIENTS: Tina Turner, Barbra Streisand, Roseanne, Elizabeth Taylor, Diana Ross, Susan Sarandon, Uma Thurman, Audrey Hepburn, Anjelica Huston, and Vogue, Harper's Bazaar and Allure magazines. Q. How did you get into makeup? A. As I was growing up in Louisiana, people told me I was ugly. I think it was because I was effeminate. Mine is the story of the ugly duckling, about being able to see that you're not what everyone around you is telling you that you are. I became interested in the idea of transformation.     Where it stemmed from, for me, was the awareness from a very early age that I was gay, then hearing how awful and evil that was. Eventually I realized that was all lies, and then I started questioning what else I had heard that wasn't true. It was a wonderful springboard for me into the world of fashion and beauty, because it kept me from accepting what was and made me see the possibilities of what could be. Q. It's interesting that you translated notions of illusion into such a literal metaphor. A. It wasn't anything conscious, but I guess it was vicarious, in a way -- the idea that if I can make you look good and feel good about yourself, that makes me feel good about myself because I helped you.  Q. What's this glamour thing about? A. At a certain point in the 80's, there was a no-makeup movement, which was, I think, a political movement. I always think everything that happens in the fashion world is based on politics. In the 80's, people in the fashion world were losing their friends to AIDS, they were watching gay and lesbian civil rights being destroyed, there was an enormous amount of sexism going on. And the fashion business reacted in several ways.     During the beginning of the Reagan years, there was a real white-male view of women as Barbie dolls -- very glamorous, and voluptuous. So in the early 80's there was a lot of Big. Big hair, big makeup, big breasts. Then, suddenly, came the no-makeup movement. What it meant politically was that women don't have to wear makeup to be accepted. It's O.K. for women to be bare-faced. And not only is it O.K., it's good, it's a great look. And it was important to expand the boundaries of what we considered acceptable.     Now, there's a return to glamour because even the no-makeup look was becoming oppressive. Q. So the fashion world presents us with an extreme? A. Always. No one's going to go home and do their makeup the way we do it for a magazine. But you can go off and say \\"Oh, purple's the message.\\" It's not about saying, \\"Go wear this to go out tonight,\\" but rather: \\"Oh, yellow! Color! I'll put a little spring into it.\\" Q. Who creates trends, and how? A. There's a really small group of people that can make a big difference. It's not like some little committee, and it keeps changing, but it's a group of people who love women and feel a great respect for women, and most of them have their finger on the pulse of what's going on, in terms of what affects their lives.     Manipulation is not part of the inspiration. It's the desire to open up doors and make things more acceptable.     That's where Kristin McMenamy and Kate Moss come in. That's where Roshumba comes in, or Naomi Campbell, who has more traditional black features than most of the black models before her. When Steven Meisel brings Kristin to the American public and says, \\"This is beauty, and it's not the typical all-American blonde,\\" it's because Steven fights for it that America wakes up. Like Barbra Streisand. Those are the people I love and adore, because they are breaking the boundaries and creating more acceptance for everyone. Q. What are some of the runway makeup trends that are new and interesting? A. I'll tell you what I think is the most old-fashioned: a ton of foundation. I think what's new is someone with dark, smoky eyes -- yet you can see their skin -- and glossy lips. Not so long ago, there was a return to the 70's, but it was done very literally, copied from a 70's magazine, without any modern take on it, which to me is uninspiring.     What I'm here for, as a makeup artist, is to present women with options. A new option is to be inspired by a look from the past, and then make it modern. Q. Who's doing the most innovative makeup nowadays? A. The Japanese are light-years ahead of everyone else when it comes to formulating makeup. It's scary to me that American companies have no clue, compared to the Japanese. For the Japanese it's more of an art. For American companies it's about how much something will sell. Q. What looks do you like? A. The whole range, from a woman who's completely dressed up, has her hair pulled back, let's say, and wears a velvet coat, huge earrings and no makeup, except for some sort of oil in her face (I love skin that looks glowing like that). Women with a lot of makeup on also catch my eye.     I love the extremes. It's fascinating to see that someone's far up on either end of the spectrum. It says they're not afraid of being different. And those are the people I gravitate toward, because that's me. Q. Where do your ideas come from? A. I get a lot from children. I look at my niece -- her little cherub cheeks, rosy lips, long blond eyelashes, dark eyebrows -- and I think: \\"That's it! That's the makeup for the show!\\"     It's not at all about making women look just like little girls, either. It's just that my niece inspired me, just like I get ideas from old movies I watch. Q. Where do fashion and beauty go now? A. That depends on what happens in politics. Makeup as Illusion And a Cue for Reality"},{"year":"1923","title":"death and career GUSTAVE A.
