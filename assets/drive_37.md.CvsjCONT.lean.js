At once loutish and poetic, cowardly and dashing, the young man who seduces the imagination of a poor Irish village with his story of having murdered his father can be played as everything from a dolt to a slippery con man to a flawed romantic hero. It depends on the actor playing him and on how harshly the director wishes to rub the audience's noses in Synge's satiric vision of the brutish life of the Irish peasantry in 1900.    In the Irish Repertory Theater's sturdy production of the play at the South Street Theater, Patrick Fitzgerald plays Christy as a little bit of each. When he first appears, covered from head to toe in mud, there is an opportunistic gleam in his eye. Later, as he embellishes his tale of having murdered his tyrannical father by hitting him over the head with a hoe, he seems more like a fool who is just beginning to wake up to his storytelling powers. Later still, when his flowery cadences win Pegeen's heart, he exudes a princely charisma.

That has been enough to test weapons and strategies in a way that hasn't happened since the Spanish Civil War, which was the proving ground for World War II.   No Soviet arms have been involved.

This film has the further advantage of clever acting, able direction and meticulous staging.Mr. Atwill appears in the role he acted on the stage last Spring. His portrayal is easy and convincing, particularly in a court room sequence in which he, as Sir Austin Howard, is on trial for his life. This stretch gives one an unusually good idea of the Old Bailey, in London, even if it does indulge in some extraordinary levity, which, after all, was thoroughly appreciated by an audience at the Roxy yesterday afternoon. This jocularity is furnished by a witness named Henry Hammer, who finds it impossible to sound his aspirates, except where they do not belong. To him his name is 'Enery 'Ammer. Slightly timid at first on the witness stand, he soon overcomes his loss of voice and is aggressive. He is wont to look at the judge as if expecting a sign of approval when he almost dismays the prosecuting counsel. The vernacular, including \\"blimy,\\" issues from this Londoner, until he is reprimanded by the court. The prosecutor endeavors to elicit further information from this witness, who then says:\\"'Ave we got to go over all that again?\\"In an introductory episode, Anthony Howard, son of Sir Austin, is so infuriated with Nora Selmer, a gay creature with whom he is supposed to be in love, that he strangles her. Sir Austin, on hearing of the death of the girl from Anthony, decides to see the Scotland Yard inspector alone. Then he finds he is himself suspected of the crime and he admonishes his son to keep silent while he faces the music.The various bits of evidence against Sir Austin are set forth in a most effective fashion. Time and what were unimportant details result in strong points of circumstantial evidence against the innocent man.In the latter episode there are two ingenious flash-backs—when the hitherto silent witness decides to be heard. Further information would perhaps render the tale less suspenseful.Besides Mr. Atwill's good work, there are fine performances by Lumsden Hare, who is beheld as the Commissioner of Scotland Yard","excerpt":"Bramwell Fletcher, who plays Anthony Howard; Herbert Mundin, who portrays Henry Hammer; Billy Bevan, who is the silent witness, and Wyndham Standing, who is a barrister.Greta Nissen is vivacious and attractive as the gay, faithless and unfortunate Nora Selmar. Eric Wilton is too fond of smiling, or the director was too fond of seeing him smile. He impersonates Nora's gigolo husband. Alan Mowbray is capital as the prosecutor.A good deal of the stage performance is given over to the glorification of \\"Mickey Mouse.\\" El Brendell afforded some amusement by his jokes.

Exhibitions are supposed to alter your ideas about an artist, which this one does. If you imagine Brancusi creating icons of distilled beauty, you are right, of course. He spent  weeks, even months, polishing his sculptures by hand until they achieved an incorporeal sheen. He ended up producing versions of his famous \\"Bird in Space\\"  that look like pure, almost disembodied slivers of radiant light. His works became ethereal masses of compressed form that referred, though less and less explicitly, to the natural world.         But if you think that this is the whole of Brancusi, that his works are just  cerebral and Platonic, you must see this show, because it reminds you that his sculptures are also odd and amusing, richly allusive and unmistakably human. They are so sensuously carved that their surfaces, never mind their sexual shapes, are erotic.    ART VIEW","excerpt":"Brancusi Reveals His Human Side"},{"year":"1982","title":"IF they had nothing else in common, the painter Piet Mondrian (1872-1944) and the sculptor Constantin Brancusi (1876-1957) shared a powerful esthetic impulse: to pare redundant nature down to pure, intrinsic form. And what each did -Mondrian geometrically reordering the world through reductive grids of vertical and horizontal lines","excerpt":"Brancusi with his soaring shafts and ovoid forms refining fleshly substance to spiritual essence - reverberates through 20th-century art.   The idea of pairing these two modern ''classicists'' in a show came to the dealer Sidney Janis some 30 years ago, when he saw Brancusi's ''Bird in Space'' surrounded by Mondrian paintings in a Museum of Modern Art minishow of contemporary collectors' holdings. And there is a logic in putting them together. In his book, ''Brancusi, A Study of the Sculpture'' (Grossman, 1968), the sculptor Sidney Geist points out that with Mondrian, Brancusi was ''the first to create, however guardedly, an oeuvre of systematic formal development, a mode of artistic activity which has recently gained currency.''   Although he waited a few decades, Mr. Janis has now carried out his inspiration by dint of borrowing treasures from an impressive roster of museums and private collectors - at least, those willing to lend the work of these now much-prized masters. The resulting show, ''Brancusi + Mondrian,'' on view through Dec. 31 at the Janis Gallery, 110 West 57th Street, splendidly upholds the gallery's tradition, begun as far back as the 1940's, of museum-quality exhibitions of European art.

Felipe Rojas-Lombardi, the Peruvian-born chef and owner, turns out a varied assortment of Iberian tidbits.  It is always fun to have a drink and tapas at the bar under a curtain of garlic ropes and dried red chilies.   On Sundays, a prix-fixe brunch buffet featuring more than 30 dishes is offered.

The ambiance is minimalist but not oppressively so.   On Sundays, there are two prix-fixe menus: $13.50 and $18.50. Among the starters are baked chilled apple and endive walnut salad with tart cranberry-orange syrup; homemade biscuits with Smithfield ham and sweet mustard; warm white-bean salad and smoked salmon, and cracked grain salad and homemade duck \\"ham\\" (cured duck breast) accompanied by dried fruits and nuts.

Le Refuge is a beguiling French restaurant just a short walk from the Metropolitan Musueum of Art and the shops along upper Madison Avenue.  The food is neither avant-garde nor from the school of old masters; it's simply an agreeable mix of updated French home cooking by the chef and owner, Pierre Saint-Denis.   The three dining rooms are smartly rustic: the front room with white walls, tasteful antiques and a small service bar; the small middle alcove trimmed with country tiles, and the all-brick back room with pretty tapestries, timbered ceiling, well-worn wooden tables and soft lighting.   Appetizers are exceptionally appealing. You can start with a verdant vegetable terrine floating on a refreshing coulis of red peppers and tomatoes, or a lovely arugula salad with warm, pleasantly tart goat cheese. Today, a grilled quail salad and a smoked duck breast salad with caramelized walnuts will be specials.   Some main courses are warm fillet of beef salad; chicken supreme with mustard sauce, and paillard of salmon with tomatoes and coriander. For desserts, there are creme brulee, warm apple tart with caramel sauce and homemade sorbets.   Appetizers are $4 to $7.50, entrees $8.50 to $14 and desserts $3.50 to $5.50. Sunday lunch is from noon to 3 P.M. (Review, April 7, 1989.) Rose Cafe     24 Fifth Avenue (Ninth Street), (212) 260-4118 -- This lively American restaurant on lower Fifth Avenue serves pleasing fare at very moderate prices. Set in the former Mosaico, the year-old Rose Cafe is owned by Richard Krause, the former chef of the defunct Melrose on Barrow Street, and two partners, Stewart Rosen and Philip Scotti.   The flamboyant tiles and bold colors of the late Mosaico have been replaced by soft eggshell-toned walls and simple cylinder-shaped sconces.  There are three dining areas, and a glass-enclosed sidewalk terrace up front affords an animated urban panorama.   On Mr. Krause's Sunday brunch menu, there are irresistible little potato pancakes with a dollop of creme fraiche and three kinds of caviar, and black bean soup with red onion and sweet corn relish. Entrees include a salad of lobster combining butter lettuce, avocado, oyster mushrooms and a drizzling of truffle dressing, and poached eggs and smoked salmon set on onion marmalade with mustard hollandaise.   Among the dessert choices are toasted angel food cake with coffee ice cream and chocolate sauce and chocolate-hazelnut terrine with creme anglaise.

Stray Cat (Makiko Esumi) is given the order to eliminate the two top-ranked killers of the Guild.

A decade ago, performances of this kind were still plentiful, and were sneered at by advocates of what was considered an authentic, pure Baroque style.
