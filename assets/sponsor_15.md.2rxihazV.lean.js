Bono said the song asked ''churches to open their doors, to give sanctuary that breaks the stigma that goes with being H.I.V.-positive.'' The five-hour concert, at Greenpoint Stadium, was organized by the Nelson Mandela Foundation for Mr. Mandela's music-led 46664 campaign to fight AIDS in Africa, and also featured the Corrs, Peter Gabriel, Paul Oakenfold, Youssou N'Dour, Jimmy Cliff, Ladysmith Black Mambazo, Anastacia, Ms. Dynamite and members of Queen. It was broadcast live on www.46664.com, which is named after the prisoner number assigned to Mr. Mandela during his years of incarceration during the apartheid era. The concert is to be shown worldwide on MTV today at 6 p.m. E.S.T., and recorded songs from the concert are available for download on www.46664.com for $1.19 each (0.99 euros or 69 British pence). Mr. Mandela, 85, sat with his wife, Graca Machel, and told the crowd: ''AIDS is no longer just a disease. It is a human rights issue.'' He added that ''millions of people infected with H.I.V. and AIDS are in danger of being reduced to mere numbers unless we act.'' Mr. Mandela's organization says that AIDS has killed 17 million people in Africa and that 30 million are infected with H.I.V. there. . . . Meanwhile, to observe  World AIDS Day, Brian May, left, and the other surviving members of Queen are making digital versions of their albums available on music-download services starting today. The group said that royalties from the first week's sales will be donated to the AIDS charity Mercury Phoenix Trust, Reuters reports, with EMI matching the contributions.

Korb, the Assistant Secretary of Defense in charge of manpower, succinctly laid out the Reagan Administration's position on proposals for a new G.I. Bill.   ''The Administration supports educational benefits for military members,'' Mr. Korb said. ''The President, the Secretary of Defense, and the Deputy Secretary of Defense all are on record in favor of some type of educational benefits for service members.''   Then Mr. Korb put his finger on it: ''But we have not supported or endorsed a particular program.''

For one reason or another - Israeli dependence on American ties and military aid, the futility of the military option for Arabs now, the fact that only Washington might be able to pry negotiating concessions from Israel - the United States has fallen into and assumed the role of Middle East policeman. While Arabs and Israelis continue to complain about the United States, their need for Washington to play a prominent role is more pronounced than ever.   For 30 years, it was a cardinal tenet of American foreign policy and politics that there would be no American military presence in that troubled area. Of course, President Eisenhower sent the marines into Lebanon in 1958, but that was to deal with a localized problem and they were quickly withdrawn. Now, the almost 1,200 marines in Lebanon could have a broader purpose and there is no telling how long they will stay, despite Administration predictions of early removal.  And although it seems forgotten, a battalion of the 82nd Airborne Division is in the Sinai in an international force policing the peace and their presence, too, is open-ended.

We admire his prodigious talent, which brought a transcendental Yankee vision to the ideas and forms of European Modernism. We respect his practical inventor's mind, his versatility and his large appetite for work, which made him one of the most prolific of sculptors. And we're also intrigued by the legend of his life, a largely solitary one on a farm in Bolton Landing, N.Y., surrounded by mountains, sky and the sculptures he placed outdoors that served as a surrogate family - a life ended at the age of 59 when his pickup truck swerved off the road. (It's a legend not dissimilar in some respects to that of another American hero-artist, Jackson Pollock.) DAVID SMITH SEEN IN HIS FULL RANGE AND SCOPE","excerpt":"WASHINGTON"},{"year":"1982","title":"It was the role of black folk art to make the unbearable bearable.  When all else failed, and society had given the thumbs-down signal once and for all, art was the restorative that made it possible to go on living. That is the message of a monumental exhibition called ''Black Folk Art in America, 1930-1980'' that can be seen through March 28 at the Corcoran Gallery in Washington. Quite apart from its size - there are nearly 400 pieces on view, some of them very large - it is on every count a most remarkable affair. Where most major exhibitions draw upon an already voluminous bibliography, this one had to be put together piece by piece on the rumor, hearsay and the hot tip.   It began as a dream in the minds of Jane Livingston, assistant director of the Corcoran, and her colleague John Beardsley. And then gradually, as a result of the enthusiasm of neighbors, friends, collectors and local historians, one house visit led to another until 20 artists in all had been chosen from a very much larger list of possibilities. A REMARKABLE EXHIBITION OF BLACK FOLK ART IN AMERICA","excerpt":"WASHINGTON"},{"year":"1982","title":"''El Greco of Toledo'' at the National Gallery of Art offers us a first-ever opportunity of coming to grips - in one place and under optimum conditions - with virtually the entire career of one of the most distinctive painters who ever held a brush. Such, moreover, is the state of the paintings and the strength of their installation that there can be few visitors to whom the show will not represent a once-in-a-lifetime experience.   The some 60 paintings by El Greco on view make a tremendous impact. They are hung, lit and spaced to maximum advantage. Almost without exception they have been restored to the visual equivalent of concert pitch, with the result that El Greco the colorist can be seen as never before.   Individually the paintings look wonderful, almost without exception. Collectively they constitute one of the exhibitions by which our age will be remembered. It is, for example, an amazing experience to see, properly shown and properly lit, what are believed to be three huge paintings from the dispersed altarpiece that once stood in the College of Dona Maria de Aragon in Madrid. Even a glimpse of those three paintings from a distance is to feel a decisive shiver of excitement. SEEING THE ART OF EL GRECO AS NEVER BEFORE","excerpt":"WASHINGTON"},{"year":"1983","title":"Twenty-five years ago it would have seemed out of the question that John Frederick Peto (1854-l907) would one day be given a one-man show at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. Peto in his lifetime had very little success, and until lately he was ranked even by enthusiasts for 19th-century American painting as an amiable near-virtuoso in the simulation of everyday objects, a successor and imitator of the still-life painter William Harnett (1848-92) and an artist more attractive to collectors of undemanding Americana than to students of high art. At the National Gallery in the late 1950's he would have been sent round to the service entrance.   But here he is in the West Building of the National Gallery, on the same bill as Raphael, Manet and David Smith. He has been given not only a full-scale retrospective exhibition but a full-scale biography-cum-catalogue by John Wilmerding, the National Gallery's senior curator and assistant director.

Besides old books, engravings, photographs, scrapbooks, and the like - neatly packed in rows of cardboard cartons - there are games, antique toys, velvet remnants, turkey feathers, dime-store jewelry, sheet music, broken wineglasses, alphabet blocks, Victorian Christmas tree ornaments and thousands of other bits and pieces used by Joseph Cornell (1903-72) as ingredients of the box-constructions and collages for which he was celebrated.  ''Cornell was not only a discriminating and insatiable collector, he was also a researcher, a curator and an archivist,'' says Lynda Roscoe Hartigan, assistant curator of 20th-century painting and sculpture at the museum, who is working on a catalogue raisonne of Cornell's works. ''The books formed a kind of 'reading and cutting' library, and he kept the rest of the material in cartons and folders as a kind of spare-parts department.''

Such are the dimensions of the show that if you happen to sneeze when you come into the room you may well walk right past it. But this, if ever, is a case in which small is beautiful.   The show in question is at Dumbarton Oaks in Washington, D.C.  (through June 26). It is characteristic of the angelic seclusion in which Dumbarton Oaks goes about its business that it has received minimal publicity and is being visited by only a very small fraction of the public that daily crowds into the East Wing of the National Gallery. But then Dumbarton Oaks, though open to all, is a private kind of place. Even among those who love it - and that means virtually everyone who has ever been there -it means different things to different people.   To the musician, it is the title of the concerto for chamber orchestra that was commissioned by the then owners of the house and first performed there under the direction of Nadia Boulanger in 1938.

That course was one of rising tax burdens to finance government activities that cushioned people from economic hardship and promoted more equal access to valued goods and services. It was one of an increasingly interventionist economic policy and of a growing Federal-state partnership, with Washington footing more of the bills and the states dancing more and more to its tune.\\n\\nThe President's achievement in so abruptly reversing the course of Federal policy is truly remarkable.

The executive director of the ballet, Jason Palmquist, told the union that the ballet was not willing to negotiate under the threat of a strike, which he said would be ''profoundly devastating not only for the entire institution, but also for the community and for the families and friends of our performers.'' He added, ''We have been negotiating with the dancers in good faith and wish for those conversations to continue.'' The dancers' union, the American Guild of Musical Artists, contends that the dancers have not declared a strike and had also sought to continue negotiations. Dancers, who performed ''The Nutcracker'' since Dec. 1, are seeking a new contract with the company in an effort, they say, to protect their jobs, safety and health.

She felt that the coin should be \\"different\\" she says, right from the moment when she was assigned to prepare it.   The idea of using a horseback motif occurred to her almost immediately, she says since Gen. Washington was a skilled horsemen and appears in many equestrian statues and paintings.
