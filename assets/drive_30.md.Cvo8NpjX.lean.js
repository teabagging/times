Designed to bring order to decisions on how much Government should spend and how much revenue it should raise, the process instead pushes politicians to set precise ceilings on future outlays based on imprecise predictions. Still, most analysts say, any process is better than none. Here is how it was intended to work: Fifteen days after Congress convenes, the President is required to present his blueprint for the fiscal year beginning the next Oct. 1.  By April 15 (last Thursday) House and Senate Budget Committees are to have presented theirs (they didn't). By May 15, a First Concurrent Budget Resolution, on which both houses agree, should be voted. It sets limits for general categories of spending - ''Military,'' ''National Resources'' and so on. Authorizing committees then try to cram dozens of specific programs under each ceiling; meanwhile, appropriations committees earmark funds for them. Inevitably the sum total of the appropriations exceeds the First Resolution's targets.  The Second Resolution, due 16 days before the fiscal year starts, was intended to provide for ''technical adjustments,'' factoring in inflation, say, or providing for natural disaster cleanups.

Now in its 33rd year, the I.A.J.E. Conference offers ample proof of the evolution of jazz education into a full-fledged industry.

In addition to students and teachers, the conference attracts members of the jazz profession at large -- musicians, producers, publicists and journalists -- so that the end results are as much an industry summit as an educational caucus. This year's conference highlights include an opening concert featuring the Ravi Coltrane Quartet and the Maria Schneider Orchestra; experimental composition workshops with the pianist Vijay Iyer and the bassist Drew Gress; and a closing-night concert with the Trondheim Jazz Orchestra from Norway and the pianist Chick Corea (above).
