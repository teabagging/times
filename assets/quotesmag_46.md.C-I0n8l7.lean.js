But for those who had seen some of her pictures over the years and believed that she was if not a great artist then a great talent, her death was particularly disturbing. Although she had exhibited on and off for over 30 years, Brown died, it seemed, before she had fixed a place for herself in the minds of people involved with current art, let alone the wider public.\\n\\n But at the Joan Brown memorial exhibition at the Frumkin/Adams Gallery on West 57th Street in Manhattan (through Oct. 23), the circumstances surrounding her death can slip right out of a viewer's mind. Partly this happens because her dealers have made an inspired selection of her work. The 21 pictures are all self-portraits, and they date primarily from the 1970's (the latest is from 1983). Our sense of elation derives mostly, though, from the spirit of Brown's art, which, like a big, rare animal suddenly encountered in a forest, is immediate and sensuous and brilliant but also masked, impassive. You can leave this show with the feeling that you've fallen in love with a girl named Joan Brown","excerpt":"but in a psychological sense you have little idea who she is.

While not as active politically in World War II Italy as such novelists as Carlo Levi, Giorgio Bassani, Italo Calvino or Elio Vittorini (or Ignazio Silone, who was in Swiss exile), Moravia and his wife, Elsa Morante, were also on the run toward the end of the war because of his anti-Fascist polemics. In his novels, Moravia's breakout from the strictures of the past took a different turn: rebellion against middle-class convention and sexual puritanism.   Moravia's stories have pretty much been confined to one place, Rome, and his themes have remained preoccupied with love, or the lack of it, to explain human behavior. Among the better-known of his novels are ''The Woman of Rome,'' ''Two Women'' and ''The Conformist.'' He has frequently placed women at the center of his stories","excerpt":"but in an age of heightened feminism, attentive readers are always aware that the author's perspective is that of a man. Another Moravia benchmark, visible in his novel ''The Empty Canvas,'' is the relationship between an artist's creative and sexual life. In that novel, while hinting that a passionate love affair can nourish art, Moravia in the end typically finds that eroticism leads to an empty canvas.

The intrinsic ambivalence, in the Christian tradition, between the innocent natural body and the tainted carnal body, between divestiture as a sign of virtue and the naked body as an occasion of sin, between denudation as a gesture of ascetic renunciation and nakedness as an invitation to wantonness, provides the dynamic of a story which is by no means part of Christian teaching.

They learn more than this about each other at their first meeting, and it is reasonably certain that Betty is quite interested in the young man. The next time they encounter each other he is officiating as a steward aboard a Channel steamer, and this fact makes Betty and her friend, Lil Pickering, suspicious. Later they run into him when he is presumed to be the owner or a yacht that is about the size of a light cruiser. This happens somewhere near Deauville, where the charming deceiver, having learned that she is the double of a celebrated American screen favorite named Dorothy Kay, poses as the young woman.The French hotel men kowtow to Betty, and she and Lil are the recipients of no end of favors. They have a jolly time on board the Tyrrell yacht and then the inevitable misunderstanding occurs. It is set right in the end in a most ingenuous fashion, but there is never the least doubt regarding Betty's future—that she will not be working as a manikin when the final fadeout comes.The film shows weaknesses in direction.

The substance of a successful negotiation, the give-and-take needed to make it work, is still hard to envisage. But there are going to be negotiations, starting next week in Madrid, and that is remarkable enough.   For the first time in its 43 years as a state, Israel will meet face-to-face with each of its Arab neighbors -- and with representative Palestinians. All the issues between them will be on the table: peace, security, land, people.    It is going to happen now because of George Bush and James Baker. Secretary of State Baker spent much of the last five months wheedling and pushing the intractable parties. But his success was possible only because the President had the vision and the courage to commit himself to this conference.   Mr. Bush seized the moment, after the Persian Gulf war, for a new effort at Arab-Israeli peace. He understood that some fundamental power relationships had changed. Those changes, still going on, offer hope for an onset of reason in the Middle East.   The end of the cold war has had an immediate impact on the region. Soviet military support for Syria has ebbed, making President Assad look to improved relations with the United States. Israeli and American fear of Communist influence has abated, making possible a joint Soviet-American invitation to Madrid that in the past would have caused alarm.   The decline in Soviet power is also having a profound impact on U.S.-Israeli relations. It has weakened, or removed, one basis for the close ties of recent decades and for massive U.S. aid: the idea that Israel was a strategic asset for America in a vital part of the world.   The gulf war showed that U.S. armed forces could act in the Middle East without Israel. In that war, indeed, Israel was a complication rather than an asset in U.S. military calculations.    Americans are still committed to help Israel, for reasons of history and conscience. But it is clear that a more detached relationship is developing, one in which America will more freely weigh its own values and interests. The Economist wrote last month:    \\"Americans still express their moral commitment to Israel's survival","excerpt":"but Israel's moral case grows steadily weaker as it refuses to extend to the Palestinians the right of self-determination that has become a cornerstone of the emerging world order. A peace which left Israel ruling over millions of voteless Palestinians has become unthinkable.\\"    Israelis are increasingly aware that they cannot expect unconditional support from the United States -- that they can maintain the vital American connection only by paying attention to American interests. President Bush made that bluntly clear when he postponed consideration of loan guarantees: too bluntly, most Israelis thought, but they understood the larger point.    In this new relationship, the territories occupied by Israel since 1967 are the crunch. U.S. policy is to end Israeli control of the West Bank and Gaza and their more than 1,500,000 Palestinian inhabitants. Prime Minister Shamir and much of his Government are committed to creeping annexation of the territories.   A new political choice is therefore shaping up for Israel: Keep the occupied territories or keep American support.   Economic realities are also pushing Israel to make a choice about the occupied territories. The reasons are explored in depth by Bernard Avishai in the forthcoming November-December issue of the Harvard Business Review.    The $10 billion sought from the United States in loan guarantees is to build housing for Soviet immigrants to Israel. But if those immigrants are to have jobs, Mr. Avishai says, Israel will need two or three times that much in investment capital from the world. And Israel will have to change its protective economic policies and become part of the global market, using its special scientific and intellectual talents.   But there will be no large-scale foreign investment, Mr. Avishai writes, and no long-term contracts with Israeli firms, while the world sees insecurity over the issue of the occupied territories. \\"Israel can have the Whole Land of Israel or it can have a piece of the global economy.\\"    Abroad at Home; Breaking the Logjam"},{"year":"1969","title":"WASHINGTON, Feb. 3 -- United States officials said today that they considered President Gamal Abdel Nasser's latest proposals for a Middle East settlement positive and encouraging, and hoped that Israel would react the same way.

That spelled boycott in foot-high letters, which is unfortunate. For, without looking too far down its mouth, \\"Amphitryon\\" would have been a fettlesome gift horse, a congenial fable with a pleasant sense of comedy and a bright new cinematic style.\\"Rhythmic dialogue\\" is Director Reinhold Schunzer's phrase for it: a habit of speaking in cadence with the score; not quite recitative, not quite singing. It's an effective device, admirably suited to a picture which seeks to approach, but not topple into, the operetta class. From rhythmic dialogue the players may shift to prose or to song without making the transition incongruous. The cadenced patter serves, too, to remind us engagingly that this is merely amiable make-believe, an impertinent myth which only pickets are likely to take seriously.It has a whimsical notion at its base: That of a foolish old Jupiter, quite ungodlike when you get to know him, forming a sudden passion for the most virtuous matron in Thebes and having the very Pluto of a time with his conquest. Alcmene, as you may remember, would have none of the whiskered old fellow she met before Jupiter's statue. (Jupiter, incidentally, didn't recognize himself from the statue at all.) So, while the annoyed Mercury accused him of the most unbecoming conduct, the president of Olympus took on the shape of Alcmene's warrior husband, Amphitryon, and tried to repeat his earlier successes with Leda and Europa.The catch was that, having assumed a human body, he was subject to human frailties. There was an overabundance of Samos wine, there was a draught and influenza and finally—an insurmountable obstacle—there was his termagant and dowdy spouse, Juno, who had to drop to from Olympus at precisely the wrong time. Jupiter, by Jove, was a much-frustrated god when the picture took leave of him. Even Alcmene had to forgive him.The picture has any number of amusing conceits: Mercury, with an umbrella and roller-skates; Jupiter's descent from Olympus in a parachute hidden by a smoke screen; Mercury's orders to assume the shape of the frazzled Sosias, Alcmene's servant's husband; the notion of Juno as a Junoesque but ancient dame. . . . There are others as amiable. It is equally true that the film slows up in mid-career (which may be due to that fact that the Joe Millers of the gods grind slowly) and that the picture's best songs are overworked. But on the whole, it's amusingly done.The cast is perfect, with Henri Garat in the dual role, of Jupiter and Amphitryon, Armand Bernard as Sosias and Mercury. Jeanne Boitel as Alcmene, Marguerite Moreno as Juno and Odette Florelle as the flirtatious servant. Myrismis.

He has even been treated reverently, as if what he wrote was worth translating into moving pictures without embellishment by some superior movie-mind! Let this be exclaimed at the outset for the reassurance of those who saw \\"The Admirable Crichton\\" slaughtered to make a movie holiday. Those who recognize the eloquent distinction between the terms \\"motion picture\\" and \\"movie\\" will understand when it is written that \\"Sentimental Tommy\\" is a motion picture, not a movie. It does not include all of the story that Barrie wrote, it skips large portions and sketches others lightly, and it hasn't the courage to go to the end which Barrie faced so resolutely, if reluctantly","excerpt":"but it brings to the screen Tommy and Grizel and Elspeth, the Painted Lady, Dr. McQueen and the others as Barrie himself created them and adds nothing to make the film a \\"super\\" or \\"extra special\\" production. So it is mentioned, with some hope, that the picture is at the Criterion.John S. Robertson directed \\"Sentimental Tommy.\\" It was he who directed \\"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,\\" which, except for its distortion of Stevenson's narrative, for which Mr. Robertson was probably not responsible, was one of the sterling works of last year. This time the scenarist, Josephine Lovett, has caught the spirit of her original, and followed its text, too, and Mr. Robertson's ability and sincerity have not been handicapped. In large part he has recreated Thrums and its people and made them live. Although a great deal of credit must go to the players, architects, scenic designers and the like, it must have required some one to direct all these, to advise, perhaps to order, them to put into the film the best that they had to give, and Mr. Robertson seems to have met all the demands of his job. If he has been literal, rather than imaginative, in interpreting Barrie, at least he has been faithful, and faithfulness is more to be desired in directors than rampant muddle-headedness—and often it must be a choice between the two. So let Mr. Robertson's worth be recognized. His work has been exceptionally well done.But what players he had to work with! It is doubtful if a more appropriate cast for \\"Sentimental Tommy\\" could have been selected. Gareth Hughes is no other than Thomas Sandys himself, and May McAvoy is Grizel incarnate. Would you know just how Tommy wagged his head? See Gareth Hughes at the Criterion. Would you know just how Grizel rocked her arms? See May McAvoy on the screen. His performance was expected of Mr. Hughes, so the most that can be said of him is that be comes up to every expectation. If he does not like this, it is his own fault. He has done so well before that the first announcement that he was to be Tommy awoke in those who feared the worst the hope that the best might be. But Miss McAvoy is a happy surprise. She has done well before, but never anything like her Grizel. She makes the difficult rôle of the Painted Lady's daughter intelligible and unforgettable. And the Painted Lady herself, in the person of Mabel Tallaferro, is one of the clear and enduring characters of the photoplay, as she is of the book. Miss Tallaferro's scenes are relatively few and brief, but her finished acting gives every one of them its full value. George Fawcett, as Dr. McQueen, is excellent, of course, and Leila Frost's Elspeth is satisfactory. So is Malcolm Bradley's Domine Cathro, and the others in the cast suit themselves to their rôles.The photography of the film is of a high order, and it also has cinematographic merit, though a good many subtitles have been used, which, however, do not do violence to the pictures and therefore are not offensive. Tommy has long since graduated from his sexless garments when the story begins, and Grizel's mind has just been restored when it ends, so it may be seen that the photoplay attempts to tell only the middle part of Tommy's life, but this has been a choice of wisdom, because obviously the whole story could not have been put into a film of practical length.So, to those who say that Barrie cannot be put on the screen it may be replied that perhaps he can't be, in his entirety and with all of his insight and perspective, but that a substantial part of the genuine Barrie can be embodied in a photoplay, and is embodied in \\"Sentimental Tommy\\" at the Criterion. It has a full right to its title.Also on the Criterion program this week are \\"Bonnie Scotland,\\" an alluring Kineto Review; \\"A Scotch Idyll,\\" an appropriate and enjoyable musical number; \\"Butterflies,\\" a colorful Prizma picture, and \\"Checkmated,\\" a diverting Hurd cartoon comedy.Not much space is left now for Allan Holubar's \\"Man-Woman-Marriage,\\" with Dorothy Phillips, James Kirkwood and Robert Cain at the head of the cast, but it does not need much space. It is simply another ornately and spectacularly done movie of—Well, man, woman and marriage as conceived without reference to fact, for those who like their fiction fallacious and bedecked with all of the trappings of theatricality. It mounts the pulpit to preach platitudes and nonsense and rewrites history to suit its notions. There is a good deal of excellent photography in it and the acting, at times, is expressive, though seldom restrained and often exaggerated, but this only makes one wish that Mr. Holubar would use his ability sincerely to tell a simple story—and that Miss Phillips would not try to be cute.\\"Roads of Destiny,\\" with Pauline Frederick, and \\"The Voice of the Ocean,\\" a Bruce scenic, are at the Capitol this week; \\"The Whistle,\\" with William S.

Under his proposal, an international agency would buy or lease oil in times of surplus, and sell in times of shortage, along the lines of the \\"buffer stock\\" proposal by Pierre Beregovoy, the Finance Minister of France. This limited approach would not address the recurrent shortages of oil supply. Specifically, it would not induce much expansion of exploration and extraction -- since it would not provide assurances to high-cost producers that prices and effective demand would be sufficiently high for a fairly long period.   A proper World Oil Agency would be authorized to enter into long-term purchase contracts with the oil-producing-and-exporting nations, at attractive sustained prices. These prices, while stimulating production, would be well below the peak prices that -- in the so-called \\"free market,\\" or actual oligopoly -- result from a cartel, natural disasters, warfare, or just the threat of warfare.   Mr. Hossein Askari's scheme would do little to encourage conservation and stimulate the development of alternative sources of energy -- some known but still high in cost, others yet to be devised, but all needing sustained support free of national political vagaries. Also, his scheme would lack the authority and power it should have to reduce oil prices eventually, so as to wind down the oil industry in favor of less-volatile, less-wasteful and less-polluting alternatives.   A World Oil Agency would pursue those objectives, notably when setting its purchase and sale prices, and possibly differentiating its prices to assist high-cost producers and low-income consumers. Likewise, it would write those objectives into its contracts for purchases, sales, and support of research and development. EDWIN P.

At the center of this first novel by a Yale law professor is the patriarch of a wealthy black family who dies under mysterious circumstances after he is forced to withdraw as a nominee for the Supreme Court. Set in academia and the well-heeled environs of Martha's Vineyard and Washington, the narrative combines politics and suspense with ruminations on race relations and the pleasures and miseries of family life.

It might seem that any director of photoplays could be introduced that way, but in most cases the introduction would be misleading. It would imply that the director had become proficient in the art as well as the mechanics of motion-picture making, and the directors who know how to make pictures that have pictorial as well as kinetic quality are relatively few. Rex Ingram, however, is one of them.He is introduced here because of his latest production. \\"The Conquering Power,\\" which was at the Rivoli last week and will continue at the Rialto this week. When \\"The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse\\" came into the Lyric Theatre last March Mr. Ingram was revealed as one of the master workmen of the screen. His previous pictures had been promising. \\"The Four Horsemen\\" was a fulfillment. Here was exceptional pictorial composition, the composition in which moving and still objects, lights and shadows, lines and masses were so arranged and controlled as to produce effects pleasing to the eye and satisfying to the dramatic appetite of the spectator. And the restraint and precision with which the players characterized their rôles, the faithfulness of the settings to their originals, the ease with which intensity of action was attained and relieved—these and other things showed the work of a man with ideas to express to whom the motion picture was a medium of expression, not a vehicle—a flivver or a truck—for the general delivery, with some damage, of the goods of the noval and the stage.But \\"The Four Horsemen\\" was originally a novel, and, despite Mr. Ingram, it remained a good deal of a novel, rather than a photoplay, on the screen. He showed what he could do in independent cinematography, but he did not do all that seemed possible to him. So the production was a fresh promise, as well as a fulfillment—and now comes \\"The Conquering Power\\" to realize much that it foreshadowed.The present work was adapted by June Mathis from Balzac's \\"Eugenie Grandet.\\" The writer is not familiar with the original, but those who are say that Balzac has been used only as a starting point for a wide departure. However, the pictured story, though often farfetched, develops some interesting situations. Furthermore, its characters are true. They do things and have done to them things that are hardly plausible, but if you accept the artificial world in which they move, you will see them moving as true types of humanity, exaggerated somewhat for emphasis, but always fundamentally genuine.The story, briefly, is of Charles Grandet, a young Parisian dandy, and Eugenie Grandet, his supposed cousin, a provincial girl untouched by Paris. Charles's father loses his money through speculation and commits suicide after sending the youth to the home of Père Grandet, Eugenie's father, and a monomaniacal miser. Of the love of Charles and Eugenia, of the opposition to it by Père Grandet, of its final triumphs, and of the life of these people and their friends in a French village, the story tells, and tells vividly because of the acting of the players and the direction of Mr. Ingram.Seeing the picture, one is first of all impressed by its pictures—which isn't always the case with photoplays. Mr. Ingram tones his scenes so that they are soft, and yet distinct. There is no difficulty in watching faces, the slightest changes of expression are immediately visible, and there are contrasts in the different scenes, but never hard outlines and conflicting elements. This is primarily a matter of lighting, the most difficult and important part of photography, but it is also a matter of the selection and arrangement of objects within a scene. For example, when the ultra Parisian Charles makes his first entrance into the rural home of his uncle, his apparel, of course, proclaims the man, and, as a finishing touch, he leads a fancily barbered French poodle on a leash. Now, the best known French poodles are white, and it is a safe assumption that almost any director picked at random would have given Charles a white dog without thinking further about it—because he would have been without the pictorial sense to do otherwise. He would not have realized that a white dog would be the highlight of his picture, something on which the eye would instinctively focus itself, and in doing so wander from the shifting dramatic highlights of the scene, the expression on Charles's face and then that on the face of each other person in the room. Mr. Ingram, however, consciously or unconsciously—it doesn't matter—avoided spoiling his picture by any such blunder. Charles Grandet's dog is black, just a shadow to give the suggestion needed without becoming disproportionately conspicuous. Here is a rare pictorial touch, and it is because of many such that Charles's entrance, and other scenes literally too numerous to mention, are a pure delight to the discriminating spectator.Mr. Ingram's facial close-ups, for example, enrich his photoplay. He uses many of them, perhaps too many, but they never give the impression that a player has stuck his or her face into the camera to grimace grotesquely and display an unblemished skin. They serve to catch significant glances and direct attention to natural expressions that reveal what is going on in the characters' minds. And their illumination gives an effective emphasis of lights and shadows without any harsh opposition opposition of fighting blacks and whites.There is no space for comment on the plentiful excellencies of the film. It is really one of the best made motion pictures that has come to Broadway. It is so good, in fact, that one cannot refrain from remonstrating against its shortcomings. They are emphasized by its virtues.The photoplay falls short of its ideal chiefly because it is an adaptation of a novel and retains much of the nature of a novel. Despite its many expressive scenes, a good part of its actual story is told in words. Without its subtitles it would be incomprehensible, so much so that at times its pictures seem merely beautiful illustrations of its text. This means that Mr. Ingram has advanced further in photography than in cinematography. Photography is, of course, an essential of cinematography, but it is not everything there is to it. Moving pictures should be expressive as well as correct in composition, and some of Mr. Ingram's scenes do not mean much.But this criticism, it should be borne in mind, is made because so many of the scenes are expressive. It is because Mr. Ingram is a better, and not a worse, cinematician than most directors that the hope is expressed that he will go on and become better than he is. One feels that he can do so. When next looking for material, can he not turn away from the novel and the stage to his own imagination or to the imagination of some one else able to compose originally in moving pictures?The acting of \\"The Conquering Power\\" is exceptionally good. Rudolph Valentino, the Julio of \\"The Four Horsemen,\\" gives a finished performance as Charles Grandet. He is a pantomimist of marked ability. And Alice Terry, the Marguerite of \\"The Four Horsemen,\\" meets every requirement for charm and expressiveness as Eugenie. Others whose work is especially noteworthy are Ralph Lewis as the old miser, Edward Connelly as a provincial notary, George Atkinson as his son and Mary Hearn as a servant in the Grandet household.THE following comes serenely from the Metro office:A noted topic of discussion at the Hollywood studios these days is whether or not Eert Lytell, who is starring in \\"A Trip to Paradise,\\" a Maxwell Karger production for Metro, of the Franz Molnar play \\"Liliom,\\" is going to take ether. In the scene where the principal character is under ether, on the operating table, the vision of heaven is had from which the title is taken. It is not yet known whether he will be given some of the ether fumes so as to make his acting thoroughly realistic.In Molnar's play Liliom does not go to any operating table and he does not take ether. He kills himself and dies permanently. His experiences in heaven are those of a dead man. But it takes some little agility of the imagination and a certain mental equipment to get the point of Liliom's life after death, and, as has been noted many times, motion picture producers shy at anything beyond the easy grasp of the most literal-minded and least informed person. So, when the picturization of \\"Liliom\\" was first announced, it provoked the following paragraph in this column on May 1 last:\\"Liliom\\" * * * will be put on the screen by the Metro Pictures Corporation. * * * Its title will be changed, however, to \\"A Trip to Paradise,\\" from which it is inferred that other things will be done to it. It has been suggested that perhaps Liliom won't die on the screen at all, but will just dream that he is dead and awake to love, honor and obey Julie for the rest of a long life.The suggestion of the dream did not come to the present writer clairvoyantly, but out of his sad experience as a mourner at the movie massacre of great novels and plays. The predicted \\"happy ending\\" is not yet definitely announced, of course","excerpt":"but it is clearly foreshadowed in the plan to put Liliom under the influence of ether. There's no hope that the operation will be fatal.Signs of the times, as noticed by Wid's Daily, indicate that no more than 550 full-length photoplays will be produced in the next twelve months, as against more than 700 last year.Which means that part of the \\"Fewer and Better Pictures\\" slogan is to be carried out, anyhow. And this is something. Even if the \\"better\\" pictures remain unproduced, there'll be fewer bad ones to sit through.

Nothing was overwhelming. It was eclectic, with a few 18th century pieces and some antiquities. A white L-shaped banquette blended into the wall. By using a lot of African fabrics and sculpture, which I love because it has such a modern spirit, we made the living room much bolder. To replace the banquette, we designed a new sofa that's smaller and dips in the center. (It's sexier-looking, and no one sits in the center anyway.) We substituted two straight-backed chairs for the Art Moderne ones. And we now have a huge African ceremonial mask, an art chair by Tom Dixon and an 18th-century Italian console along the wall. It's a wonderfully lyrical combination.\\" CARL D'AQUINO'S DOWNTOWN GARRET \\"I live in an artist's studio at the top of a pre-Civil War town house, with northern skylights and a terrace that doubles the apartment's size in spring and summer. The proportions are perfect, with a center hall shaped like a cube.    \\"The changes I made were subtle, but they brought about a radical change in feeling. The most significant step was to replaster and paint the walls from a soft gray-white to a pure white in a flat, matte finish. I installed clear glass in the skylights instead of opaque, and suddenly everything popped. I particularly love the crispness of the dark woods against the pristine walls.   \\"I also added splashes of texture and color, like the rug in the foyer, which is made up of many pieces of brightly colored sisal. The pillows on the sofa are now a creamy yellow on one side, a green stripe on the other. The whole place feels larger, and the art stands out without any special lighting.

I have the same amount of furniture; the pieces are just less bulky. And even though it's still a casual look, it actually feels more sophisticated because of the pieces I chose -- a French tapestry chair and an English storage chest, for example.

Putting aside all questions about the arbitrariness of such a system, it fails to take into account the underlying causes of the morass into which we are further heading.   By its very nature, the fee-for-service system does not lend itself to regulations. The decision to do a diagnostic or therapeutic procedure often is based not on black and white criteria, but rather a ''gray'' zone. The subjective (professional) judgment is often the key factor, as recent studies of great regional variations in medical practice show.  The ability of a third party to judge decisions varies universally with the ''distance'' from the actual situation: the patient at the time of the illness. A perusal of a hospital record requires giving a great deal of leeway for physician discretion.  The two dominant trends behind the increase in medical costs are (1) advancing technology with an increasing number of ever more highly reimbursed procedures, and (2) a fee-for- service system where the purchasers have carte blanche and the providers determine how many services will be provided. The system has had virtual immunity from ''market forces,'' which is why it is the fastest-growing segment of the economy; anybody can tap into it - witness the growth of the for-profit health-care sector.

The insufferable nearness of death, of unthinkable pain, creates a dramatic tension which sets the nerves quivering and which often gives to a superficial plot a sense of power and depth which is not really inherent in it. Set beside the cream pufferies of the average film plot which carefully avoids all the fundamentals of life, war themes seem to have roots that reach deep into the bedrock of human nature.\\"Morgenrot.\\"And a great deal of this tragic glamour is spread over \\"Morgenrot\\" (\\"Dawn\\"), which has just had its première at the Ufa Palast. The background of the somber years of the war lends it an almost classic severity. And for the first time we are given a dramatic picture of a submarine from the viewpoint of its crew. We see it torpedoing a British destroyer and then sinking to the bottom of the ocean, while the British fleet tries to locate it and destroy it with mines. Later a British decoy boat which looks like a peaceful sailing vessel draws it into an exchange of broadsides, which ends with the decoy catching fire.But the allied boat has signaled a British cruiser and this rams the submarine, which sinks, hopelessly damaged. There are ten men left alive in the gradually filling hull and only eight divers' suits. So two of the crew, by sacrificing their own lives, make it possible for the rest to rescue themselves. Before this, the commander of the submarine and his first officer are shown as two of the principals in a superficial but tastefully delineated love story. The first officer is in love with the daughter of the Mayor in his home town and believes she cares for him","excerpt":"but it is the commander to whom she is really attached. When the first officer finds this out, it is easier for him to give up his life to save his comrades.But, aside from its propagandistic tendencies, it is a film of exceptional qualities. It would be difficult to praise too highly the work of its director, Gustav Ucicky, a Czech, who is, paradoxically enough, the Ufa's specialist for nationalistic films.In vivid contrast to the murky tones of \\"Dawn\\" are the light pastel shades of an equally important component of the film month—Annabella, the French actress, who has taken Berlin and wrapped it around her slender little finger. Within a week two films in which she plays the leading rôle have made their bow on the Berlin Rialto. First came René Clair's \\"July 14th\\" at the Gloria, and this was immediately followed by \\"Marie\\" at the Mozart. At the moment she can have anything she wants from the film Reich.I'm free to admit that I fell utterly under the enchantment of her grace and youthfulness, her gladness and simplicity. This comely young lady can give the feeling of a completely unspoiled naïveté, a freshness—the other screen actresses who can communicate that you can count on the fingers of a mitten.A Lovely Maid.So in \\"Marie\\" she has little chance to be her better self. She wanders through the sad little story spreading sweetness and light when she should have been stimulating our tear ducts. Another type of actress would have fitted infinitely more snugly into this slight but delicate legend from the Hungarian by Ilona Fürlöp. And you can't help being sorry that it did not have a better reception. For it's well off the beaten track—this fable of the servant girl who succumbs to the spell of a Spring night and is then discharged because she is expecting a child. She can find work only in a disreputable café, and there she brings her daughter into the world.But the authorities take the baby from her and she sinks to drunkenness and death in the gutter. In Heaven her task is still the scrubbing of floors, and years later she looks down to see her daughter just about to do the very thing which ruined her life. In desperation she empties her pail of water onto the earth and a downpour of rain falls on the young person. That final touch is truly Hungarian in its fantasy, and it seems to come direct from Ferenc Molnar's workshop.But, just to keep the balance even, we were lucky enough to get a full-length portrait of Annabella in René Clair's \\"July 14th.\\" The French director seldom allowed her to slip into the pensive, and then it was no deep, heart-searing grief that stirred her. This is Annabella as she should be. You already have had reports about this picture, so I will only record the undiluted approbation of the Berliners. I personally found the most remarkable thing about it was the complete technical mastery to which René Clair has arrived. \\"Sous les Toits,\\" \\"Le Million\\" and even \\"A Nous la Liberté,\\" for all their fragrance, had many arid, amateurish stretches. But \\"July 14th\\" is completely mastered from every angle; its humor always comes off just when the director intended it to, and there is no fault to be found with camera work, sound recording or cutting. From now on M. Clair is out of the experimental field.However commendatory the production of experimental films is, and however much they sometimes do to stimulate the producers of more conventional screen ware, it's very seldom that anything as satisfying as \\"Sous les Toits\\" and \\"Maedchen in Uniform\\" comes out of their ranks. Even Carl Froehlich, who supervised \\"Maedchen,\\" hit away off the mark in his latest cooperative picture, \\"Mieter Schulze gegen Alle\\" (\\"Tenant Schulze Sues Every One\\"). Despite a few amusing scenes this picture of the dwellers in a Berlin apartment house is superficial, lacking in characterization and screen ideas. And an equal disappointment was the first film of that very smooth-surfaced actor and stage director Gustaf Gründgens. His adaptation of Gogol's \\"The Inspector General\\" he called \\"A Town Stands on Its Head,\\" but it wasn't even a fraction as exciting as that.

Mr. Ivens's camera argues gently and persuasively, with the irrefutable argument of pictorially recorded fact, that the Spanish people are fighting, not for broad principles of Muscovite Marxism, but for the right to the productivity of a land denied them through years of absentee landlordship.By comparison with the picture's commentary, written and presented by Ernest Hemingway, the camera would seem to be mightier than the pen. Hemingway's narrative is, of course, superb. It is terse, powerful, and at times informative","excerpt":"but it is vengeful, bitter and unreasoning. In its contemplative way, the film argues its point much more effectively. Its technique is that of the film document, but Hemingway's narrative makes it a definitely propagandist effort.Mr. Ivens had planned originally a film of the lives of a pastoral people under fire, moving his camera back and forth between the front line and the near-by fields to show that, even under the menacing shadows of bombers overhead and despite the rumble of artillery not so many kilometers away, the task of reclaiming this newly won land, irrigating it, cultivating it and making it produce, was going placidly on.In the zeal of the sponsors, Contemporary Historians, Inc., to present the picture rather as an outcry against Spain's invaders than as a sympathetic study of the Spanish people, this plan of Mr. Ivens's has been thrown off balance. The accent is on the war, and for most of the picture's hour the camera is on the battle line, or studying the lives of people in a besieged city. The irrigation problems of the little village of Fuenteduena, on the Madrid-Valencia road, become, unfortunately, a secondary matter.But Mr. Ivens's importance in the cinema is as a realist, and it is the realism of \\"The Spanish Earth\\" that makes it so compelling. In the fields of Fuenteduena he apparently had time to strive for composition and photographic values. But in the more hurried work, following soldiers into battle, watching bombs fall in Madrid streets, catching the faces of frightened, hopeless people, he achieves composition, cinema effect and dramatic impact as well.His camera discovers a boy quietly writing a letter home during a violent attack on a Rebel position in University City. In the same gloomy basement the camera glances around, now down the sights of a siege gun to record a hit on the skeleton that was once the university's clinic, now into a broken mirror, finding the ruined objective reflected there.There is no emphasis on horror, rather an avoidance of it. It is on a people and their reactions, the street scenes, the children aping their men, that the camera dwells. A man carries a coffin through the street; on the other side a soldier carries a box of cigars. In the ruins of the palace of the Duke of Alba a scarred marble Venus leans dejectedly against a heap of debris; while an efficient clerk at a desk catalogues the art treasures salvaged after the bombardment. There is a warning cry, and a crowded Madrid street looks skyward. The bomb falls, and the people fall away, like the first big ripple after a stone is tossed in a puddle. Two small boys dash out to pick up fragments—souvenirs. The next scene finds them dead.\\"So the next shell finds them,\\" comments Hemingway. \\"The German artillery has increased their allowance per battery today.\\"The ubiquity of Ivens's camera gives Hemingway plenty of material for his biting comment. \\"This is a true face of men going into action. It is a little different from any other face that you will ever see. . . . Men cannot act before the camera in the presence of death.\\" . . .\\"The people hate them, for without their tenacity, the Spanish revolt would have ended six weeks after it began. . . . They signed to work in Ethiopia, the prisoners said. There were more Italians killed in the battle of Brihuega than in all the Ethiopian war.\\"\\"They say the old good-byes. He says he'll come back; she says she'll wait. He says, 'Take care of the kid'; and she says 'I will,' and knows she can't. But they both know that when they move you out in trucks, it is to battle. Death comes each morning to these people of the town, sent by the Rebels two miles away. The smell of death is acrid high-explosive smoke, and broken ground. Why do they stay here? They stay because it is their home.\\"The scoring by Marc Blitzstein is an arrangement of Spanish folk-music. The editing and introduction of sound effects were done at the Preview Theatre here by Mr. Ivens, Miss Helen von Dongen and a staff.

Letters to The Times; Future of Kenya"},{"year":"1929","title":"Whether the ending is as dramatic as is to be anticipated from the testimony and the fading-out into stories of the various witnesses matters not, for the court room scenes during most of the picturization of Frances Noves Hart's novel. \\"The Bellamy Trial,\\" which was launched last night at the Embassy Theatre, are intelligently and ingeniously filmed. The happenings are related in an impressive fashion, and the narrative, though told with due respect for the solemnity of the occasion, is often relieved with flashes of humor that so often accompany such proceedings.Toward the close of this picture there are spoken chapters, and while some of the dialogue is open to adverse criticism, chiefly because of the limitations of the new device, it nevertheless holds the attention. It is curious during the stillness of a murder trial, however, to hear the synchronized music, which, while it is intended to cover the hushed passages, rather causes one to reflect as to the whereabouts of the unseen orchestra.This picture was directed by Monta Bell and in all probability the spoken interludes were inserted after the silent production had been finished. The main point, however, is not whether the bulldozing prosecuting attorney is permitted too much latitude, or if the vocal effects are adequate, but whether the picture is entertaining. It is, most decidedly","excerpt":"but it is, nevertheless, a pity that the producers should have evinced so much eagerness for sound.The character studies in the course of the court room scenes are particularly cleverly drawn. The composition of the cast is of rare excellence. The people appear to belong to everyday life and not to Hollywood. There is the raw-boned, tenacious prosecuting attorney who sneers and thunders at the witnesses. There are subtle shafts of satire, on such scenes as they might happen in small-town court rooms. The attorney for the defendants is dignified and alert, quick to take exception to a number of his learned opponent's questions.A thoroughly human touch is that of having a pretty girl watching this her first murder trial. She is a journalistic school graduate and is seated next to a very wise young male reporter. During the audible periods these two are heard whispering to each other. The girl declares the prosecutor to be a \\"beast,\\" and the worldly wise young man writer smiles in a knowing way.The manner in which this pictorial story is appoached comes as a surprise, for after having seen on the screen a number of actual newsreel incidents one finds one's attention intrigued by scenes at the Bellamy trial, which come without the formality of a title, a list of characters or even the name of the director. More than one person in the audience imagined that the trial must really have happened, so true to life are the scenes around the court house.The mystery is one concerning the murder in a cottage of Mimi Bellamy, a young wife whose life was by no means beyond reproach. Sue Ives, played by Leatrice Joy, and Stephen Bellamy (Kenneth Thomson) are on trial for the murder.The prosecuting attorney, impersonated by Charles B. Middleton, fortifies himself with peanuts before the court opens, and during his harranguing of the witnesses he is wont to munch these. After questions have been propounded by this legal light Mr. Bell switches to the girl and the worldly wise young man. The girl is played with restraint and feeling by Betty Bronson and the young man by Edward Nugent. Mr. Nugent is capital and there is nothing out of place in the comedy elicited by Mr. Bell during these glimpses.It is also with no little relief that one beholds an attractive young woman on trial for murder who is not thinking of her latest hat or the gown she is wearing. Miss Joy appears to have her mind on the trial and she does very well in the spoken episodes.The atmosphere of the court room is adroitly contrived, even to a model of the room where the murder was committed and a dummy to represent the body of the slain woman.Mr. Bell has worked with imigination and almost all of his scenes are blessed with a twist or a touch that makes them different from similar scenes in other motion pictures. THE SCREEN"},{"year":"1927","title":"While Michael Curtiz, an expert in odd camera angles and compelling dissolves, has introduced some interesting protographic ideas in his latest production. \\"Good Time Charley,\\" the story of this film teems with cheap sentiment and extravagant comedy. The incidents are handled in an extremely haphazard fashion, so that, in the circumstances, almost anything might happen. There is a fund of material in this subject, but little of it is effective. It is like using a bludgeon to bring tears and explosives to create laughter.\\"Good Time Charley\\" is a story of an old tragedian who, like Job, is sorely tried. His wife is killed by a mercenary producing manager. He eventually loses his sight and his daughter becomes the unfortunate wife of the son of the man who is virtually her mother's murderer.This picture, with less detail and some true conception of story-telling, might have been an approach to \\"Debureau\\"","excerpt":"but it isn't. It is one of those films where the poor old man with a half-wit pal finds that the whole world is treading upon him. \\"Good Time Charley's\\" real name is Charles Keene. He is the type of actor dubbed a ham.In the early episodes this production looks promising, but after Keene's wife dies, the narrative is told in a childish fashion. Apparently, Rosita Keene, beloved by Charles, her father, also adores the old man. Nevertheless she succeeds in keeping out of his way when she is most needed and he is able to deceive her into the belief that he is a whale of a success on the stage. Poor, old Charles is saving up his money, or that of Bill Collins, his faithful pal, because he has been told that an operation costing $1.000 will give him back his sight. Just when he has about that sum. Rosita appears and tells her father that she is sorely in need of funds to go abroad. So Charles gives his daughter the currency that was stored in his abode.Subsequently the old actor learns that John Hartwell was responsible for Elaine Keene's death. So you have a sequence wherein Charles goes to Hartwell's office. He is not able to see the man he wants to shoot, and he is not even given credit for being able to hear Hartwell's movements. Excitement or some acute stage of hatred eventually causes the blurred form of Hartwell to appear before the veteran actor in a mirror. Charles believes that he is pointing his pistol at Hartwell and he pulls the trigger only to hear a crash of glass.This scene is well acted, but poorly directed. Warner Oland gives a splendid interpretation of Charles Keene, both before and after he is attacked by blindness. Clyde Cook has some amusing tricks, but most of them are terribly out of place in this type of yarn. Helene Costello does fairly well as Rosita and Montague Love is competent as John Hartwell.The Movietone news reel is exceptionally interesting. In one stretch the Prince of Wales is heard and seen addressing a gathering. His voice is not only clear, but it would easily be recognized as that of the Prince. Another episode deals with the recent Yale-Princeton football game and in this reproduction one gains a vivid impression of the excitement in the Yale Bowl.

While Japan and Germany have alredy rigged their government-subsidized broadcasting systems for stereo television, most American broadcasters and cable companies are digging in their heels, the better to stand pat on the status quo.

François Truffaut, in reviewing a movie by Claude Berri, once wrote, \\"Tout les enfants de Toni s'y reconnaitront\\" (\\"All Toni's children will recognize themselves in it\\").The movie, which is, naturally enough, in black and white, is about Basque, Southern French and immigrant miners in the Midi, and it has a curious, muted, infinitely poetic way of treating human passion. Although it was made in 1934, it is particulary moving now, adjusting moods down from a glare and a shout to a still, fine, quiet tone.

It wears its X's rather as Hester did her scarlet letter, proudly","excerpt":"but it shows a really interesting seaside confrontation of generations and ideologies.The film, which opened yesterday at the 72d Street Playhouse, begins with some shots of a worn, middle-aged couple asleep in a nice house, some waves and a Danish beach marked \\"Privat\\" and \\"Forbudt.\\" (It is one of those foreign movies in which a combination of extremely good subtitles and foreign-English homonyms makes the script perhaps more entertaining to follow than it was in the original.) A fine family—mother, father, daughter, maid — inhabit the house, in a row of similar houses, along similar beaches. The fathers in all the houses come out for horrible invigorating morning swims at about the same hour each morning.One summer day, as she is lying on the beach studying for her exams, the daugher (Sisse Reingaard)is picked up by a young man passing by in a motorboat. They begin an affair; and as the summer progresses, he maneges to convince her by degrees that one purpose in life is physical pleasure, and the other is filming. He films their affair and whatever other sexual interludes he can find; he projects the films for her and, later on, for her mother (This is where the X's mostly are.)He crashes a party given for the girl by her family, and makes her a present of a book of pornography, which her father ultimately burns in the fireplace. In retaliation, after a long mock-Messianic speech, the young man burns the Bible. (This is somehow the most genuinely shocking moment in the film.) The father, struggling to regain the offensive in some way, invites the young man to five with his daughter in the house. The young man accepts, and finally, very nearly seduces the mother (Astrid Villaume). In the end, the father is provoked to lock up the girl and throw the young man out. But the film really ends, as it must, in an impasse.What is interesting about \\"Venom,\\" aside from some incidental photographic effects (like the filming of a fine gluey, undercooked dessert in a tense dinner-table scene) is that it presents its case absolutely straight. The young hedonist (Soeren Stromberg) is neither rugged nor poetic looking; he moves and talks with completely charmless insolence. The jowly father (Poul Reichhardt) is no model of squaredom either; before the young man's arrival, he has been shown lusting after his own daughter, approaching the maid and propositioning his secretary.The young man's argument is the weakest and least winning that can be made for youth. He does not speak of love or sentiment (in fact, in a fine scene of some young people gathered on the beach, he delivers another mock-Messianic speech to a girl whom he suspects of being a romantic, then parodies the laying-on of hands and runs his camera); and he does not pretend to have been disillusioned by any moral failing of his elders.He is that product of affluence, the completely useless full-time nihilist, and he simply challenges society to continue to afford him. (The film's soundtrack, brief, even denies him the support of the best argument for his generation: the distinction of its music. There is hardly any rock in it at all.)The father's situation in this conflict is quite clear: he cannot win until he finds something the young man wants, and within himself, the power to withhold it. The young man has the daughter (although not that unambiguously either; and one of the subthemes of the movie is the failure of men to protect their women from threats to the social framework within which they can be loved). The father has money.There are intimations that the young man is accessible in one sense: he has ambition. He would like, through his films, to be famous, to be rich in the new currency—publicity—which measures wealth in terms of the number of people who have access to one's name. The father can, and does, deny him money to distribute his films.But in the end, the older man, the representative of order, has only two weapons: love of his daughter and the moral nerve to commit violence. When he attacks the young man, the young man is helpless; but the need for violence is, in itself, a defeat; and that is the stand-off between them. Youth is inert, and the older generation is compromised.There is some very fine comic acting by Judy Gringer as the maid (creator of the ill-fated dessert), and some nice, understated acting on the part of Grethe Morgensen as the secretary. It would have been really interesting to see the film (written and directed by Knud Leif Thomsen) uncensored because then it would have turned, in part, into the film the young man was making. But that, presumably, will be some years yet. Screen: Nihilism on a Danish Beach:' Venom' Here on Wave of Censor's X's"},{"year":"1990","title":"Iraq's Saddam Hussein is doing his best to make nuclear weapons. If he survives the Persian Gulf crisis in power, he will certainly be more determined than ever to press his effort. Even if he doesn't, his successors may continue the attempt, as successive Governments in Pakistan have done.   When superpower nuclear stalemate is credited with maintaining the long peace in Europe and bringing containment of the Soviets to victorious fruition, it would be wise to consider again the fundamental issues in question. There are no prospects for ridding the world of all nuclear weapons, and profound controversy over whether it would even be desirable. I think not, but in any case it isn't possible in the foreseeable future.   Before the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty was signed in 1968, it was predicted there would be a score or more nuclear states by now. The last two may not have actual weapons in stock, but could build them quickly. In response to intense United States pressure, South Korea abandoned its project. But North Korea has not. Argentina and Brazil have given up, at least for now. But many still challenge the principle of the taboo.   Saddam Hussein has, only slightly obliquely, renewed the argument about discrimination that accepts some nuclear powers and prohibits all others. His country, he claims, and by implication any in the third world, has an equal right to all high technology available to advanced industrial countries. He considers it imperialistic arrogance to deny \\"equalizing\\" weapons to latecomers.   This needs to be addressed, along with whether the demonstrated deterrent value of nuclear arms might work to prevent conflict among other countries. No nuclear weapons have so far been used in the world since the two that ended the war with Japan in 1945, but there have been well over 100 wars around the globe in the meantime.   In Mr. Hussein's case, there is an answer to the effect of deterrence. He has launched two major invasions and shown that his eagerness in acquiring weapons is to use them, not to prevent war. There are no grounds to think greater Iraqi capacity would bring more responsibility.   But what about \\"rights\\"? Is there and should there be a democracy among nations as expressed in the United Nations thesis of \\"sovereign equality\\" for all?   Some third-world spokesmen are also giving the idea of global democracy a new twist, arguing in terms of population. They contend that more than four billion of the world's people have ultimate decision against fewer than one billion.   It is a silly and pernicious argument. There is no global vote and the four billion are at odds with each other","excerpt":"but it shows how the notion of democracy can be deformed. It isn't just about numbers.   At base, the issue is power. It is unequally distributed and it will remain that way as long as the state system prevails. Some are big and some are small. Some have wealth or equality, and some do not. Some are acquisitive and aggressive and some are satisfied.   So it comes to whether the world community can sort out its myriad problems peacefully, or whether some countries have a justified responsibility for imposing a certain order. \\"Equalizer\\" came into the parlance from the American wild West, the gun that was decisive in a lawless environment. A world with unrestricted rights to the mass-destruction \\"equalizers\\" would be one of tyranny and unrelenting terror, because we are still very far from a law-abiding world.   This is an age of peculiar transitions, not only in technology and society but also in thought. In the aftermath of the cold war, there is a new shift in the perennial balance between idealism and realpolitik in international affairs.   Senator Daniel P. Moynihan of New York has just published a book, \\"On the Law of Nations,\\" showing how far the principles of international law were distorted and undermined during the long East-West confrontation. He is right that it has been a grievous setback, a loss for everybody in a time when the actions of practically any country are coming to affect the lives of practically all. The gulf crisis is a new test of the community's will and ability to respect laws that all profess in the abstract.   But it is also a reminder that law is not self-enforcing. Cynical realpolitik, based on self-interest without standards, was carried much too far. But it cannot be replaced with utter idealism. The \\"rights\\" of nations are limited, and the limits must be imposed by those who can. They may not be more virtuous, but they must strive for it. That is the reason to continue insisting on nonproliferation.

This is understandable and, in a sense, admirable","excerpt":"but it upsets me just the same to see the musical cart hitched before the cinema horse and then be constrained to admit it was probably for the best.Abel Gance, who wrote, directed and produced the film, reasoned naturally that the thing to do was give it the accompaniment of Beethoven's music, played in this case by the Orchestra de la Société des Concerts du Conservatoire de Paris under the direction of Louis Masson. What he did not appreciate—or, if he did, cared less—was that Beethoven's music does not accompany; it may sometimes be accompanied. Here it is accompanied by a narrative with fitful moments of poignance, by a cast of rather depressing solemnity, by photography which infrequently matches with its imagery the imagery conjured by a Beethoven sonata or symphony.Thus, one is not likely to be more stirred by the Moonlight Sonata through the film's pretense that Beethoven improvised it while a chit of a blonde presumptuously assumed to be the \\"Immortal Beloved\\" of that love letter found among his effects, was telling him of her plans to marry another. Nor is his Appassionata made appreciably more beautiful because a devoted pupil, hiding behind his deafness, whispers to him of her love as he unmindfully busies himself at his composition.Mr. Gance's cameras do, however, assist the score in one heartbreakingly tragic, gloriously exultant sequence. It is that when Beethoven goes deaf and stumbles through a village which has suddenly become a nightmare. A street fiddler is scraping away, the blacksmith is ringing sparks from his anvil, women are chattering at the river bank, birds are singing, a light breeze is laughing through the trees. But it is only mocking pantomime when he draws near, soundless and hateful. Then, back in his mill, he hears the thunder and, shaking a defiant fist at the skies, screams \\"I will match you!\\" and sitting at his organ pours out the throbbing music of his Sixth Symphony—the Pastoral.If \\"Beethoven\\" always had the poetry of that sequence, it might have enriched its score, rather than be so deeply in its debt. Harry Baur's lowering portrait of the composer is almost as uni-dimensional as it is impervious to time. (Beethoven is as wrinkled at 31 as he is at 57.) Jany Holt is merely the Parisian ingenue as the \\"immortal\\" Juliette, while Annie Ducaux as the faithful Therese comes closer to illuminating the romantic-tragedy theme Mr. Gance has written. But always and always there is the score—fragments of the Sixth, the Third, the Ninth, a full-throated Miserere, admirably played—to justify the film and to serve bettter than its cameras in telling us that Beethoven lived.

He says, for instance, that I wouldn't be deterred from my support for racial integration even ''if no positive effects could be shown'' when, in fact, I say nothing of the sort and, indeed, devote a lengthy section of the book to demonstrating the consistently successful outcomes of a number of good interdistrict integration programs, presenting data he does not dispute and relying also on my own experience as a former teacher in one of these programs in suburban Boston.     But it is Glazer's tone, more than his factual inaccuracy, that is most injurious. He correctly notes, for example, that New York's whitest and most wealthy suburbs spend approximately twice as much per pupil as is spent on the black and Hispanic kids I write about in the South Bronx, and he says, as if he is perplexed by this, that I express ''outrage'' at these numbers. For his part, Glazer makes it clear that he is happily immune to outrage on such matters. Much to the reverse, he writes, ''I have often been amused by these per-student expenditure figures,'' and then wanders off into one of his familiar ''thought experiments,'' as if he were no longer talking about real and living children but about some abstract entity that brings him cerebral enjoyment. It must be nice to live in a world in which you can be pleasantly amused about injustices from which you do not suffer. The 6- and 8- year-olds whom I describe do not have that luxury.     Glazer insists that white indifference or racism are not the major obstacles to integrated education. ''Rather, other values, which are not simply shields for racism, stand in the way,'' he says, one of which, he adds, is ''freedom from state imposition.'' Is it not strange that no such exculpation was provided by Mr. Glazer or by any other reputable Northern intellectuals to white segregationists in Mississippi when they raised exactly the same clarion call of ''freedom from state imposition'' (or, in that case, ''federal imposition'') to defend their own apartheid system 50 years ago? Why was it so transparently ''racism'' in the South? And why is it now conveniently discovered to be ''other values'' when it comes to Northern states such as New York?     New York has the infamy today of being the most segregated and unequal state for black and Hispanic students in the nation. The New York Times may rightly be embarrassed by the segregation -- educational and residential -- it has calmly tolerated in its own backyard for far too many years","excerpt":"but it was a cynical injustice to drag out a neoconservative war horse, gifted at genteel equivocation, to sweeten this story for consumption by your readers. The shame of the nation is not simply that conditions of near-absolute apartheid now prevail in New York City's schools and those of a growing number of its suburbs, but that those who have the power to define the borders of permissible debate refuse to name and to confront this unacceptable reality. Glazer's long, inaccurate and inconclusive essay (it's not really a review, because it scarcely touches on the narrative that makes up nine-tenths of my book) serves its purpose, I suppose. It helps to lower the temperature of the debate and to appease the conscience of those people in New York and other Northern cities who pretend to honor Dr. Martin Luther King while ripping apart the dream for which he died.      The great equivocators will not win in the long run. There is a surge of rising indignation among tens of thousands of young people in this nation, including those many idealistic and determined teachers who come into inner-city schools and don't pretend that educational apartheid is simply a piece of distant history but know it is alive and well right now, because they see it every day before their eyes. They will rise up one day before too long to resurrect the spirit of risk-taking action that their parents' generation has abandoned. When they do, they will shake the very foundations of an unjust social order that condemns the children of the black and brown to a subordinate existence. No nation can get away with crimes against its own children forever.    Jonathan Kozol     Byfield, Mass.    Nathan Glazer replies:      I was not aware that I had been ''criticized repeatedly and severely, both in print and in many public settings'' by Jonathan Kozol when I was reviewing his book, and only learned of this criticism from his letter. I am not referred to in ''The Shame of the Nation'' nor, I believe, in the one earlier book by Kozol I have read. I assume the editors of the Book Review were also not aware of his criticism, and that if they had been they might not have asked me to write the review. In any case I hold no animus against Kozol. We both agree on the desirability, justice and fairness of racial and group integration and of equal public financial support for students' education. The issues between us are how and whether we can move further toward these objectives under our political system and its distinctive version of democracy.

It's a documentary, photographed in black-and-white and, I suspect, it's designed principally for television","excerpt":"but it's one of the more moving, more cheering theatrical experiences available in New York this weekend.It can be seen at noon tomorrow and Sunday, this weekend and next, at the Elgin Theater, on a double bill with \\"On the Line,\\" a more elaborate—in color and longer by five minutes—documentary that, like \\"Union Maids,\\" deals with cooperative social action, which is sometimes but not always trade-unionism.\\"Union Maids\\" is very much about trade-unionism but it's even more about three extraordinary women, Kate Hyndman, Stella Nowicki and Sylvia Woods who, in the course of three separate interviews, which are intercut with each other and with period newsreel footage, recall their lives as women laborers and union organizers in Chicago in the late 20's and 30's.It was a sometimes brutal, bitter, mingy time for all labor and especially for women who didn't believe their places were necessarily in the home. Yet it was also a time of terrific hope, when one could believe in social and political progress and measure it by the concessions won through group action.Kate, who appears to be the oldest of the three, has the face of an elderly schoolmistress whose seeming severity is constantly denied by her comic self-appraisals and by the warmth and the passion with which she recalls her life as a labor militant and feminist. That didn't always go down too well with the labor militants who were male.Stella grew up on a farm in Michigan and, as a young woman, moved to Chicago to work in the stockyards. Sylvia, a black woman who was born and bred in New Orleans, also moved to Chicago at an early age. There, she was active in organizing the laundry workers who, as she remembers with biting humor, were mostly women who worked seven days a week and had to provide written explanations to their bosses when they were absent.Largely because of Sylvia this requirement was eventually dropped. Her ploy: to persuade every woman to give as the reason for her absenteeism, \\"just tired.\\"Julia Reichert, James Klein and Miles Mogulescu, who jointly directed and produced \\"Union Maids,\\" never get in the way of their subjects and never put words in their mouths. They don't have to Sylvia, Stella and Kate are three naturals, characters whose hearts and minds leap off the screen with a kind of grace and nobility I haven't seen in a documentary since Jerry Bruck's \\"I.F. Stone's Weekly.\\"\\"On the Line,\\" directed and produced by Barbara Margolis, has no comparable focal points and, indeed, I'm not quite sure if it has any focal point at all. It looks rather like a documentary whose material failed to provide the film maker with the kind of drama and narrative shape that Barbara Koppel found in her \\"Harlan County, U.S.A.\\" Its material includes interviews with workers at the Ford Motor Company in Mahwah, N.J., with rent-striking residents at Co-op City in the Bronx, an engineer at an RCA plant who feels the company no longer values him and with a Medicaid worker.Their common complaint is that contemporary America is running amok with rising prices, unemployment, and a generally heedless attitude on the part of the people who might be able to control the economy.There's nothing especially wrong with the vision the film presents, but the vision is too diffuse to have much impact on the screen. The film maker wants it to say more than she does, to which end, I suppose, Miss Margolis uses an off-screen narrator (Rip Torn), which gives \\"On the Line\\" the feeling of an industrial film. The best, most effective, documentaries tend to speak for themselves, not through off-screen mouthpieces.

Technicolor British films about working-class life in London. It is not very good","excerpt":"but January has been, in general, a poor month for movies, and it might be a good idea to look at the bright side—which, since the quality of the color makes England look like April in Disneyland, is very bright indeed.Carol White, who plays Joy, the young mother (and Poor Cow of the title), is very pretty and natural in a part that amounts to Mrs. Alfie. People who liked \\"Alfie\\" will probably like \\"Poor Cow.\\" Joy is married to a burglar, played by John Bindon (a former seaman whose first film role this is). When he goes to jail, she falls in love with a gentle, sensitive friend of his, played very well by Terence Stamp. When he also goes to jail, she becomes a bar girl and photographer's model for middle-aged amateurs. She has a lot of affairs and divorces her husband; but she is really waiting for the return from jail of the man she loves.The film's similarity to \\"Alfie\\" lies in its idea of the working-class young, freed by a period of prosperity from any hard need to work, leading empty lives absolutely permeated with Mod, until their attractiveness ends and they are left, without any real resources, to themselves. The difference is that Joy can keep her baby. And one of the movie's really excellent scenes occcurs when the child is briefly lost, in a section of London where demolition and reconstruction are going on. As Joy searches for him (and Carol White plays this scene beautifully), there is a moment's sense of things lost track of, of life—for an instant's lapse of attention—turning unalterably bleak.For the rest, the film's complete ungenuineness rests, like \\"Alfie's,\\" really in the assumption that no matter how deeply you sound its characters. Mod is what you find: color, fabric, irresponsibility. Joy and Alfie are romanticized into a Vinyl lack of individuality.There are some fine comic scenes with Joy's aunt, played by Queenie Watts (who also appeared in Joan Littlewood's good movie, \\"Sparrows Can't Sing\\"), and some rather nice musical accompaniment by Donovan.One odd thing: despite Joy's many lovers, the camera turns quite skittishly away from love scenes. It seems, in this context, a mistake. An argument can certainly be made for sex in movies that try to approach seriously the problems of the young; and this one, which begins so frankly with maternity, seems to have become quite nervous about things physical right after the credits came on.

The scene effects in sunny Italy, in colorful Paris, in drab Port Said and the lazy South Sea isle are admirable, the atmosphere being interesting and quite convincing.It is the author's theme and the way in which the narrative is told that inspire one, rather than Richard Barthelmess's portrayal of the leading rôle. The picture would benefit by a generous cutting of many of the inactive or slow moving close-ups. Rhythm is agreeable, provided there is some change in the player's expression, something to sustain the interest","excerpt":"but lacking this a series of turning and twisting heads is apt to be tedious, and some times almost ridiculous. A little more than a flash in a number of cases would have been sufficient to impress one with the character's mood. Some of the close-ups fail to agree with the poses of the players in the long-shots, and Eric Fane (Mr. Barthelmess) has two distinct varieties of handwriting.Mr. Barthelmess's acting causes one to think that he is playing the rôle without giving his undivided attention to the mood of the character. After struggling ashore, Eric Fane drops unconscious, but he recovers with wonderful alacrity in the arms of Teita. It would have been more convincing if this recovery had been gradual. In his moments of deep thought Mr. Barthelmess is hardly natural. Regarding natural acting, Somerset Maugham, in his introduction to the posthumous autobiography of Sir Charles Hawtrey, wrote: His [Hawtrey's] natural acting deceived them [the auditors] into thinking that there was little more in his acting than charm and ease. They [the auditors] said he was wonderfully life-like and thought it was due to a happy chance. But the naturalness of the realistic actor is as artificial as the plausibility of the realistic play. The natural actor is as far from the naked truth of fact as the ranting barnstormer.\\" Mr. Barthelmess is an earnest and handsome young man, but he fails despite all his eagerness to appear natural.This story opens with Mr. and Mrs. Howard Fane—Eric's parent—who are about to listen to a symphony composed by their son. There are two musical critics in another box, and one of them relates the story of Eric's struggles to become a composer. The orchestra, which is directed by Carl Edouarde, the conductor of the Mark Strand musicians, fades out in the second chapter into a busy jazz band, in a Paris café, which is playing one of Fane's compositions. He is then at the point when he is writing music for money. He scorns a check for 500,000 francs to return to America and work in his father's office. Princess Rhea, a mercenary beauty, is opposed to Fane's ambition, being a stanch believer in gold. Repeating the words of Fane's father, she finally tells the young man that she won't waste herself on an empty-headed fool chasing phantoms.Fane is then seen in a dive in Port Said, which experience is reflected, as are the others, in the symphony to which the mother and father are listening.A sailor whose brain is fired with wine threatens San Francisco Sal and Fane shoots him. Quick as a flash the resourceful Sal tells Fane to put on the supposed dead man's cap and coat, and so with the mariner's papers he embarks for the South Seas aboard the ship on which Erbert Jones was to sail.The last chapter to the South Seas deals with love and agony and an answered prayer. Bessie Love is seen in the rôle of Teita, in which part she is effective, although it would have been more telling had she made her complexion a littleness pale.In the end one of the music critics congratulates Fane's mother and father on the musical genius of their son. It is a distinctly novel idea to have the scenes in which the parents are listening to the son's symphony inserted at different points. It is also an excellent stroke to have the young man still in the South Sea island while the New York orchestra is playing the symphony of his life.Carlotta Monterey is sinuously effective as Princess Rhea in the Italian and French episodes. Helen Ware's portrayal of San Francisco Sal in Port Said is distinctly fine. The other members of the cast are quite efficient, but there seems to have been no thought concerning Father Time's marks on the countenance of young Fane or his parents.A short film which awakens no end of sympathy by its simple interest and charm is \\"The House of Mercy,\\" in which the activities of the St. Bernard does in the Alps are depicted.

Still popular with a certain kind of domestic tourist, it nonetheless remains, determinedly, a curiously old-fashioned backwater replete with 19th-century houses and quaint tearooms.    Yet, for the discerning traveler, the Isle of Wight has much to offer, which is why it was a smart idea to open a stylish top-end hotel with its own segment of coastline. Priory Bay, on the east side of the island, is, quite simply, a country house hotel on the beach. It offers the elegance and luxury associated with country house hotels in Britain, but without the stuffiness.

B. Priestley's novel, \\"The Good Companions,\\" are now appearing on the Mayfair screen in a picture which was made under the aegis of the Gaumont-British and the Fox Film Corporation. Although the film gives a rather fleeting conception of the book, it has the desired affable quality and is therefore quite beguiling. It is, indeed, a better production than was to be expected, for, while there are omissions and a certain hastening of parts of the narrative, the cheery personalities are present and in good form.This picture has the distinction of being the first film to be viewed by the King and Queen of England in public. It was directed by Victor Saville, who seldom reveals signs of a keen imagination, but in this particular instance the shortcoming has stood him in good stead, for he has permitted Mr. Priestley's imagination to reign throughout the scenes. Considering the length and substance of the book, the screen script has been mapped out most shrewdly, so that the impression remains that one has seen much more of the good companions than one really has. It attacks the various episodes in a sensible fashion and the coincidental meeting of those who choose to leave their homes and encounter each other is never strained.Oakroyd, the Yorkshireman who leaves his abode after losing his job, is admirably acted by Edmund Gwenn. He gives Oakroyd's dialect the proper inflection without ever overdoing it. Mr. Gwenn's performance is of great help to the picture. Val Gielgud, known as John Gielgud on the cast list over here, happens to be a member of the Terry family on his mother's side and his portrayal of Inigo Jollifant is a joy to behold. Jollifant is the schoolmaster who quits his position and strikes out for adventure in other sections of England.Jessie Matthews, who has been seen in other British pictures over here, is charming as the stellar player of the itinerant theatrical troupe, who choose the name of The Good Companions. Then there is Mary Glynne, who does very well by the rôle of Miss Trant. This sterling character chooses to explore Britain and accidentally comes across the traveling players, whom she rescues by putting money up to finance their performances in various towns.The gallant little band strike a heat spell, and soon Miss Trant is at the end of her resources. The Good Companions, however, decide to put in what money they have saved in the meantime to keep the show going for another week. Then comes a welcome rain, and all goes well with our genial people. They have an exciting time during a performance when hoodlums, employed by a rival producer, cause a riot in the theatre","excerpt":"but later that evening they continue the show and the song sung by Susie Dean (Miss Matthews), and composed by Jollifant, is a huge success.The romantic interest furnished by Miss Matthews and Mr. Gielgud is as nicely performed as one would wish. Miss Matthews sings pleasingly and dances gracefully, while Mr. Gielgud's portrayal is extraordinarily real.It is one of those stories which is all the more worth while for having been made in England, for, aside from the naturalness of the players, there are the scenes of country houses and hedged roads, which add to the general effect of the picture.

A few hours after this despicable crime, I presented a demonstration lesson for area teachers on the Palmer raids of the 1920's, named for President Wilson's attorney general, in which some 6,000 people suspected of being Communists were arrested. Student readings included excerpts from one of the proposed sedition bills that flooded Congress in 1919, contemporary periodicals and political cartoons that helped galvanize public opinion.   In the lesson I warned students to be careful in drawing analogies to current events. That evening as I heard interviews with experts on terrorist activities and the countless recommendations from talk radio, I could not help drawing analogies.   I applaud \\"Precautions After Oklahoma City\\" (editorial, April 21) and Anthony Lewis's column of the same date, \\"Faith in Reason.\\" I fear, however, a public demand to enact the omnibus counterterrorism bill will lead our elected representatives to a response without careful consideration of its ramifications.

Ghosts Of Carolina"},{"year":"1930","title":"Out of Fereno Molnar's play \\"Liliom,\\" which was presented here about nine years ago, Frank Borzage has produced a most compelling talking picture, one of the surprises of which is the way Charles Farrell's portrayal of the shiftless, conceited bully, derisively called Liliom, stands up against such competent players as Lee Tracy and Rose Hobart. In the light vocalized works in which he has figured hitherto Mr. Farrell's voice was always an uncertain quantity, but here he reveals confidence in his utterances, and while now and again his pronunciation of some words is not according to dramatic technique, his speech on the whole is an unexpected improvement.His characterization may be more the result of Mr. Borzage's astute guidance than due to his own understanding or spontaneity, but there is no denying that he has carried out instructions intelligently. The picture is helped greatly by the fine acting of Miss Hobart and Mr. Tracy. It is a courageous adaptation, for in lieu of spoiling the spirit of the Molnar play by capitulating in some fashion to a pleasing ending the producers adhere to the original ideas, taking full advantage of those fantastic episodes dealing with Liliom's journeyings (after he commits suicide) to the regions of Paradise and Purgatory.The admirable simplicity with which the events are unfurled in the mundane stages of the narrative create a genuine suspense and the closing glimpses of a train that conveys Liliom to the Celestial zone and down to Hades are accomplished with keen imagination and camera wizardry.The picture is, moreover, endowed with wonderfully interesting settings, including flashes of a dining car on a Hungarian train and views of a carnival.Liliom fancies he is irresistible to the girls and women he meets. He is a conscienceless specimen of humanity, who works as a barker in a carnival, the owner of which, Mme. Muskrat, is herself infatuated with the improvident young scoundrel. Julic, a servant girl, meets Liliom and falls in love with him. Even when she is warned by the police of his intentions, Julie, played by Miss Hobart, persists in accepting Liliom's attentions. He treats her badly, is lazy and always wears a sweater instead of a shirt, collar and coat. But one day something happens that makes him more human. It is when Julie tells him that she is going to have a baby. Wild with mingled feelings of conceit and joy, he hastens to tell everybody he knows and even those he doesn't know.An individual known as the Buzzard is eager to steal the contents of a paymaster's satchel. The Buzzard paints a picture of the comforts to be derived from money, referring to a journey to America","excerpt":"but Liliom is not enthusiastic about the idea. However, as days go on he is less opposed to the robbery. Then the Buzzard gives him a long knife, saying that a blow on the head might not be enough. Reluctantly Liliom consents to aid in the crime, but when they attempt the hold-up the two men find that the paymaster has his pistol ready and Liliom, rather than spend a term in prison, stabs himself to death before the police can apprehend him.He dies with Julie standing over him and then the spectator perceives a train sweep into the room and the spirit of Liliom, clad and looking as he died in life, rises and boards the train, which soars through the clouds with men in winged hats officiating as guard and conductor. Liliom faces the Chief Magistrate, who explains that he is the Chief Executive of the Celestial regions. Hearing from Liliom of his great wish to see Julie's child, the Chief Magistrate says that he will give Liliom a chance to go down to earth again after he has spent ten years' in Purgatory. A train with fire sizzling from the car wheels and the locomotive takes Liliom away for his period of punishment, and, after that is ended, Liliom returns to earth to gaze upon his youngster. And all that happens is not according to his expectations, but he is deeply impressed with the fact that Julie is still against wedding the carpenter, the good man who wanted her for a wife long before Liliom committed suicide.Miss Hobart gives a beautifully impressive portrait of Julie. H. B. Warner is kindly but firm as the Chief Magistrate. Estelle Taylor does well as Mme.

Indeed, for me, the principal allure of the Franche-Comte was that Julien Sorel, Stendhal's unforgettable character in ''The Red and the Black,'' came from there. Then, one day, I was riding the Paris Metro and saw a poster of waves of snowy fields bordered by pine forests. The poster said that the Franche-Comte was the paradise of cross-country skiing in France, and I decided to go.   Cross-country skiing is growing so rapidly in popularity in France - a country dedicated to the downhill variety - that even the fashionable Alpine resorts of Savoie are tending a few miles of trails these days for what is called ski de fond, meaning literally skiing at the bottom.

In fact, while watching young Baume, Sorgues and Macroy of the boarding school of St.-Agile, we tended to confuse them with Tom Sawyer, Huck Finn and Joe Harper, a kindred trio, who used to hold the same secret conclaves, plot the same truances and runaways and get involved eventually in much the same dark melodramas. Baume & Co. are foreigners, of course, so Tom and Huck probably wouldn't have got along with them at all","excerpt":"but Mark Twain knew the breed, and would have liked them. They are his kind of youngsters.St.-Agile's wasn't what you'd call a first-rate school, not even with Eric von Stroheim as its language instructor and Michel Simon as its teacher of drawing. Something strange was going on after dark, which was the time Baume, Sorgues and Macroy used to tiptoe down from the dormitory to the natural-science room to salute Martin the skeleton, and hold whispered meetings of their Skull and Crossbones Society—a very secret order established to consider ways and means for running away to America. Sorgues was the first to see the phenomenon: a man appearing out of the nowhere, glaring at him and vanishing again. And Sorgues was the first to disappear.Macroy was the next to go, then something happened to M. Simon's grotesque M. Lemel, and finally only Baume remained of the membership of Skull and Crossbones; only Baume, who didn't quite trust Mr. von Stroheim's Herr Walter, and decided to keep his midnight vigil alone in the natural-science room, with Martin grinning whitely beside him. It is a situation Twain would have relished and slowly developed for the frightening appearance of Injun Joe. If there are no Injun Joes in France, there are people just as frightening, and \\"Boys' School\\" introduces one of them.The picture, then, is amusing juvenile fiction, with more than the usual concessions to the grown-ups. M. Simon's characterization of Lemel, the solitary-drinker, is a jaunty, fascinatingly fantastic bit of make-believe. Mr. von Stroheim handles a sympathetic role with his usual undertone of the sinister. Serge Grave, Marcel Mouloudji, Jean Claudio as the secret three and Claude Roy, Pierre Labry, Aime Clariond among the other members of the student body and faculty have gone well beyond the bare requirements of part and plot, giving the picture a richness of characterization and an atmospheric interest that make it well worth seeing.

Illustrated. 523 pp. Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press. $75.   THE life of Henri Matisse doesn't offer much in the way of drama, and Matisse's painting and sculpture, though radiant with feeling, are just a tad impersonal. The Olympian clarity of his art depends on a certain denial of the autobiographical impulse. Matisse is one of those artists - more in the line of Raphael than of Michelangelo - who are reluctant to leave shreds of undigested feeling hanging around. In the midst of his gigantic achievement, it may seem foolish to regret the absence of a more personal note","excerpt":"but Matisse can sometimes project the off-putting, holier-than-thou aura of one of those great writers who have burned - or have meant to burn - all their personal papers. Matisse would probably be glad to know that more than 30 years after his death the relationship between his art and his life looks as elusive as ever. The basic paradoxes remain: he is still the timid slow starter who went farther than almost any other artist of his age; he is still the conventional-mannered bourgeois - people called him ''Professor,'' ''Doctor'' - who smashed every convention of bourgeois art.

Griffith's latest work, \\"The Idol Dancer,\\" with Clarine Seymour, Richard Barthelmess and Creighton Hale in the leading rôles, is at the Strand this week. Apparently it seeks to set forth a story of savage, semisavage and civilized human beings thrown together on an island of the South Seas and transformed into better beings by the action on their common humanity of eternal truths, true in the tropics as well as in New England.As the story progresses the religion of a white missionary and his nephew triumphs over the hostile spirits of a derelict beachcomber and an untamed girl of mixed and romantic ancestry. But the beachcomber has the remnants of a conscience and the heathen girl, although she dances â la Doraldina, has a sense for finer things.In the end the beachcomber throws his bottle of gin into the ocean and the girl casts her idol away. Also she consents to wear clothes, and, it may be imagined, will even go shopping on Fifth Avenue within a few months. All of which may indicate that, to the mind of one at least, \\"The Idol Dancer\\" is not convincing.As movies go, it is moderately good, and Mr. Griffith may be commended for another effort to keep out of the rut worn deep by others","excerpt":"but Mr. Griffith certainly meant his picture to be something more than just a movie, and isn't it possible that he is in danger of getting into a rut of his own? In áttempting to show that the people of New England and the New Hebrides are fundamentally the same he is in danger of showing simply that New England people and points of view may be imposed on a background of the New Hebrides—in the movies.Miss Seymour won her first important laurels as Cutie Beautiful of Broadway in Mr. Griffith's \\"The Girl Who Stayed at Home,\\" and in \\"The Idol Dancer,\\" she is not a \\"mysterious dancing girl of barbaric beauty,\\" as one announcement describes her, but just Cutie Beautiful in a grass costume doing the hula-hula. Mr. Barthelmess, as the beachcomber, more nearly approaches the genuine, but he, too, for the most part, seems to be merely acting a part. And so do the others.It may be of interest to note that Mr. Griffith and his party were on their way to the Bahamas to make \\"The Idol Dancer\\" when they were nearly lost at sea.On the Strand program is one of Max Fleischer's enjoyable \\"Out of the Inkwell\\" cartoons, and a scenic entitled \\"Mountains and Soul Kinks.\\"Dorothy Gish does much to put life and fun into the old story of the innocent country girl at the mercy of city villains in \\"Mary Ellen Comes to Town,\\" at the Rialto this week. \\"The story itself follows well-worn lines, but Miss Gish's antics make it refreshing. She does not burlesque it, and missed an opportunity in not doing so, but at least she does not take it seriously, and accordingly has not done so badly as she might have. She is assisted principally by Ralph Graves, Charles Gerard and Rhea Haines. The picture was directed by Elmer Clifton.Also at the Rialto is a Chaplin revival, \\"The Champion,\\" and a novel, if frankly advertising, work in pen and ink entitled \\"The Striking Tire,\\" which should make automobilists enjoy a lecture on how to treat their tires.Wallace Reid, supported by a good company including Theodore Roberts, Tully Marshall, Ann Little, Guy Oliver and others, is at the Rivoli in \\"Excuse My Dust,\\" another automobile story, a equel to \\"The Roaring Road,\\" but not its equal.\\"The Song of the Paddle,\\" a Bruce scenic of exciting rapid-shooting and impressive views, is also at the Rivoli.\\"The Virgin of Stamboul,\\" with Priscilla Dean, is at the Broadway, and the Capitol is offering \\"Young Mrs. Winthrop,\\" with Ethel Clayton, and the first of the Booth Tarkington screen comedies, \\"Edgar and the Teacher's Pet.\\" THE SCREEN"},{"year":"1923","title":"\\"Trailing African Wild Animals,\\" produced by Mr. and Mrs. Martin Johnson, is the feature this week at the Capitol, and on its first public presentation yesterday the picture was received with constant outbursts of applause. Mr. Johnson delivered a running explanatory talk, adding to the information already supplied in the subtitles, and emphasizing at the outset that the dangers from snakes and attacks of wild animals were all \\"bunk.\\" He said that they had had one mule killed by tsetse fly, that they had seen only half a dozen snakes, and that the most dangerous time they had in the two years in that section of Africa, seventy-five miles south of the Abyssinian border, was when a huge elephant charged to within a few feet of the camera, being stopped by a well aimed bullet. S. L. Rothafel, manager of the Capitol, presented this interesting production without music, preferring to have it accompanied by Mr. Johnson's remarks.Mr. Johnson explained that many of the scenes were taken by long-distance lenses, by the use of which he obtained excellent results.Among the hundreds of \\"shots\\" in this production the sequence that is most striking is where three huge African elephants, with great flapping ears, are chased by Mrs. Johnson, who is just five feet one inch in height. This modern Diana fan after the three beasts until she was quite a distance from the camera. In a title the question is asked:\\"What is she going to do if she catches up with them?\\"The great pachyderms appear as frightened as three poodles—scared of the little woman with a gun. However, in another series of scenes the elephants appear to have held a conclave and decided upon a charge. Mr. Johnson took the gun and Mrs. Johnson turned the camera. The big elephant, who decided to be brave finally fell from a well-aimed bullet.This film is a remarkable piece of work, and the pictures of giraffes, zebras and other animals taken with six-inch and twelve-inch lenses, fill the screen like a close-up. In fact one can almost count the stripes on the zebras, some of whose heads are bent at the small water holes, while others are listening.Another thrilling set of scenes shows a wounded leopard, his spotted body and head distinctly visible through the jungle growth. In the next picture he has been slain, his skin being carried along by one of the black boys. Lions at some ???stance are seen loping over the uneven ground. Mr. Johnson followed them with the camera thus obtaining a thrilling set of pictures. Most of the time Mrs. Johnson went forth with the gun while her husband stuck to the camera, trusting to the good aim of his little wife, who slew one of the lions.In all Mr. Johnson counted forty-four kinds of wild animals. He used his \\"blinds\\" until he thought that the scent drove the beasts away, and then went to other \\"blinds,\\" returning to those where he had been when he thought the animals had become accustomed to them.In the course of the picture many different types of homed animals are shown at the water holes.It was interesting to observe that most of those that had tails wagged them contentedly, especially when drinking. The rhinoceros in his bath is a splen???d picture, and there are also several scenes showing the elephants cooling off in the water.The photographs of the Johnson picture are even more impressive than some of the scenes in the H. A. Snow production. So far as interest goes Mr. Snow obtained a lot of comedy with his \\"flivver\\" and the wart-hog","excerpt":"but Mr. Johnson has his wife in his production. Mr. Johnson's photographs of the lions are decidedly better than those in the Snow picture, especially where there is pictured the wounded beast, shot down by Mrs. Johnson. The editing and titling of the Snow picture is, however, unusually well done. Both films are remarkable productions. Incidentally Mr. Johnson's film has the distinction of being endorsed by the American Museum of Natural History as a scientific record.Mrs. Johnson addressed the audience when the picture was finished, saying that she longed to get back to the wilds of Africa, as she was afraid of the dangers of New York, especially the taxicabs.\\"The Girl of the Golden West,\\" David Belasco's stirring play, was presented yesterday in picturized form at the Strand. It might be interesting to hear what Mr. Belasco would have to say about this photoplay. It would certainly exasperate the theatrical producer if he witnessed what the film experts have done with the production. They seem to have turned it successfully into a sort of ten, twenty and thirty melodrama, in spite of the fact that they have stuck to the story as far as was possible. The chief trouble seems to be in the selection of the cast.Edwin Carewe, the director, chose Sylvia Breamer, to play the part of the Girl. Now that the production has been made it is obvious that Miss Breamer is not the type suited to fill the rôle of a girl who ruled with an iron hand the bar and the gambling den bequeathed her by her father. Miss Breamer is gentle, wondering-eyed, undemonstrative and sweet. She does not possess the sharpness or spontaneity of action demanded in the title rôle of this production. Rosemary Theby, who has the part of Nina Micheltorena, the dancing girl, would have been better suited to the part of the Girl. This picture also suffers from too much direction and too little characterization.Russell Simpson is good as Jack Rance, although his make-up is only tolerable. However he does carry along the story and show an interest in the sequence. J. Warren Kerrigan has the part of the bandit, Ramerrez. In those golden days of '49 there may have been Beau Brummell bandits, but Mr. Kerrigan outdoes the usual conception of a handsome, beguiling bandit. His face is too smooth, his eyebrows too straight and neat, and his hair too wavy, for any one Who runs a band of highwaymen. When garbed as the Mexican he has slashes in the lower extremities of his trousers through which protrudes fine lace. When he is wounded by the Sheriff and kept in bed by the Girl, his chin is wonderfully free from any sign of a beard. Mr. Kerrigan is a most unusual Mexican.When Jack Rance comes to get the bandit, the snow falls from his shoulders, leaving not the least suspicion of moisture; it looks as if he had been partly covered with salt before going before the camera. He does do his best in the scene in which the drops of blood fall on his hand and handkerchief, and also when he succumbs to his passion for gambling and plays three cold hands to see whether he will take his prisoner or let the Girl keep him.When Nina, filled with hate, appears before the Girl, Miss Breamer seems to merely touch her hand. Nevertheless Nina is whirled around as if by some electrical contrivance. This happens two or three times in this set of scenes. It is not acting, but merely the girl doing what she is told to do by the director, and Miss Breamer not living up to the zeal necessary in those scenes.It looks very much as if economy had been preached on this production.Give Four Little Plays at Benefit.The Irvine Players yesterday afternoon presented four one-act plays at the Punch and Judy Theatre for the benefit of the Greenwich House Fresh Air Fund. Among the players were Ruth Cumming, who wrote two of the playlets produced; Josephine Uterhart, Margery Clark, George Kendall, Glenn Mahannah, Elizabeth Jarecki, Pierre Dene, Helene Mount, Elizabeth Fitzgerald, Hildegarde Halliday, Agnes Craven, John Parrish, Ann Bliven, Antonio Petrucelli, Willard Joray and Philo Higley. THE SCREEN"},{"year":"1984","title":"Allan Kozinn writes frequently about music and musicians.         Gidon Kremer has an uncanny talent for having things both ways: He insists that he is not concerned with fame, and he argues vehemently against what he sees as the anti-musical commercialization of the concert business. Yet, much as he avoids behaving as a young career-minded musician is supposed to, his concert schedule is full, his discography contains a healthy 50 LPs, and at age 37, he is unquestionably a concert world superstar. Unlike many in that class, though, he tends to recoil from the promotional hype of the career mechanism. Six years ago, for instance, when he was still a mystery to many concertgoers here, he was proclaimed by the usually more reticent Herbert von Karajan ''the greatest violinist in the world,'' an assessment echoed and embellished upon by many reviewers since then.    Mr. Karajan's remarks gave the violinist's Western career a boost","excerpt":"but Mr. Kremer's reaction was to distance himself from the praise: ''I feel as if my management is selling me like a table,'' he complains. ''You know, here's the world's greatest violinist, and this is the slogan that goes with it. I don't fit that. I wish I were less famous, but could play music the way I feel is right.''
