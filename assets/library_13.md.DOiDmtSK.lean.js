GOING OUT GUIDE"},{"year":"1998","title":"The rich girls get your attention, as rich girls do. Lucy, Kate and Alexis, once 7-year-old classmates at the Nightingale-Bamford School in Manhattan, have gone their separate ways: to boarding school in New Jersey, to a suburban public school and to Chapin. But here they are together again at age 14, talking to the director and the cinematographer about subjects like divorce, money, religion, careers and drugs.    They are among the 16 teen-age subjects of ''14 Up in America,'' a consistently fascinating documentary that has its premiere Sunday night at 8 on Showtime. Michael Apted, this show's co-executive producer, started it all when he interviewed an assortment of British 7-year-olds about their lives and turned the talks into a 1964 film called ''7 Up.'' He returned to the same children every seven years and made a new film each time (''42 Up'' is coming soon).

The promised waiting time at this fancy new garage: 2.5 minutes PUBLISHING  Those Business Week Papers Let's see. First Procter & Gamble sued Bankers Trust, saying it had been led down a too-risky investment path. A mass of papers quickly piled up -- lawyers tend to be good at that -- and a judge decided some of them weren't quite ready for public consumption. Then Business Week got hold of the sealed papers and smelled a scoop, a judge said no, and all sorts of First Amendment hell broke loose. Last week some smoke cleared, as the judge unsealed the documents, which seemed to bolster P.&G.'s case by disclosing losses at other companies from derivatives sold by Bankers Trust. But the free-speech issue was left smoldering, for the judge also insisted he had the right to stop publication. Now it's in the lap of the appeals courts.  CHARITY  Throwing Big Money at Cancer  It's all too familiar these days: a takeover, a merger, a little board-room back-scratching, and some executive walks away with a sum that would boggle the mind even if it lost a couple of zeroes. But last week came a stunning variation: the mind-numbing sum was going not to an executive but to science. Jon Huntsman, who made about $1 billion in chemicals, lost both parents to cancer and battled it twice himself. That was enough to prod him to say he'd give $100 million to a cancer research center at the University of Utah. That may be walking-around money to Ted Turner, but it's the largest individual gift ever to medical research. \\"It's been 26 years since a man walked on the moon,\\" Mr. Huntsman said, and we're still battling cancer. He wants to win this one. AUTOS  Speaking Out at Chrysler  The seat belts are off at Chrysler. Last week the chairman, Robert Eaton, lashed out at those he said wanted to \\"trash\\" the company -- mainly Kirk Kerkorian and Jerome York. He said Mr. Kerkorian, who now owns nearly 15 percent of Chrysler, \\"has no real knowledge\\" about what's happening and is merely out for \\"personal gain.\\" He said Mr. Kerkorian and Mr. York -- the former Chrysler executive who's now in Mr. Kerkorian's camp -- are merely harming other shareholders by trying to gain control.    REAL ESTATE  Japanese for 'Low Rent'  Japanese real estate prices are so high they're almost an international joke (so long as someone else is paying them). So when you hear that they've plummeted -- by two-thirds or more -- in recent years, does that mean they're out of the stratosphere? Not exactly. You'll still spend $6,000 or so (every month!) to rent a modest suburban house, perhaps $4,000 for a one-bedroom Tokyo apartment","excerpt":"this is Japanese for \\"plummet.\\" And it may not even last. Last week the I.M.F. forecast a recovery for the battered Japanese economy in 1996, though it did lower its estimate for the nation's growth this year. Rent 'em while you can. CAREERS  The Mailroom Gambit  It is, so it's said, the American way: if you're near the top of your field, you make a good living. So you'd think that Jay Bonin, who's in the top 200 or so Americans in his chosen field, would be riding high. If he'd been a lawyer, he might have been one of the hundreds of that profession at the Simpson defense table; if he played baseball, he'd be out there spitting with the richest of them. But Mr. Bonin's great talent is chess. Yes, there's $1 million in prize money in the world championship match that was speeding toward a conclusion last week atop the World Trade Center, but in chess, if you're not at that pinnacle, you'd better have a day job. Mr. Bonin, brilliant at chess, makes a few thousand a year at it; by day, he's a mailroom clerk. INNOVATIONS  Making Cats Easier to Love  There are, those tireless statisticians tell us, 63 million cats in this country. There'd be a lot fewer if it weren't for one Edward Lowe. Cats, you see, smell. Built for the desert, they use water with enviable efficiency, but the downside is that their urine . . . well, you know. To fight the odor, people tried sawdust, sand, wood shavings, but they weren't much help. Then one day in 1947 -- a watershed day in feline history -- Mr. Lowe had a neighbor try a dried, granulated clay used to sop up grease spills in factories. And, yes, Kitty Litter was born -- along with what is now a $600 million annual industry. And Mr. Lowe? In 1990 he sold his business for $200 million. And last week he died at age 75. OPPORTUNITIES  Gulps of Premium Juice  Who has the most impact on this marvelous capitalist machine we inhabit? Well, one week it might be Bill Gates, the next week Newt Gingrich, and the next, Steven Spielberg. Last week, of course, it was 12 faceless jurors in a Los Angeles courtroom. They spoke, and this mighty economy -- which prides itself on packing every second chock full -- ground to a halt for long, long minutes. You could have heard a stock drop, if any had been trading; you could have heard the phone ring, if anyone had called. The jurors spoke, and whole conglomerates were born -- reported $1 million sales of photos of the reunion of the defendant (what was his name?) and his children, tales of $50 million pay-per-view blowout interviews, other interview deals, book deals, and then probably books about the book deals. And, yes, talk of a television drama series based on the lives of two DNA experts. And it's only just begun.  HEALTH CARE  Medicare Plan Under Fire  Medicare may well need patching up, but the Republicans' notions about how to do it took a lot of flak last week. First came the American Medical Association, which has kept silent for much of the recent debate but now voiced concern that limits on payments would scare too many doctors away. \\"It would be a major blow,\\" said an A.M.A. spokesman. Then the A.A.R.P. joined the fray, saying Congress was cutting \\"too much, too fast\\" from projected spending. Newt Gingrich has been trying to get the elderly on his side, but he doesn't seem to have succeeded. And in a final attack, the head of the American College of Physicians said bluntly, \\"We are not on board.\\" Diary"},{"year":"2004","title":"Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that job creation revived in January after abrupt year-end slowdown, with employers adding 112,000 jobs for the month","excerpt":"this is job market's best performance since economy started pulling out of recession in 2001, but growth in employment is well under 175,000 jobs expected by forecasters, and short of 150,000 new jobs that economists consider necessary to absorb new entrants into labor force; unemployment rate declines slightly in January, to 5.6 percent from 5.7 percent in December; charts (M) Job Growth Picks Up But Misses Forecast"},{"year":"1928","title":"MacLeish, A, Streets in the Moon MOTORS AND MOTOR MEN","excerpt":"THIS IS JORDAN'S NEW TOMBOY"},{"year":"1994","title":"MORTEN GUNNAR LARSEN'S parents weren't exactly scandalized when he suggested, while still a student at the Norwegian Music Academy in Oslo, that he might prefer playing the music of Jelly Roll Morton and Scott Joplin to that of Grieg and Sibelius.

We have an old family recipe for anise cookies that is basically the same as the one in the first editions of ''The Joy of Cooking'' (it was removed from the newest version). These cookies are supposed to puff up while baking and get a hard white top. We have made these cookies for decades at holiday time, and sometimes they get the white top and sometimes they don't. What's the trick to getting this automatic meringue?    A. The trick is to beat the eggs enough, says Shirley Corriher, a food scientist in Atlanta and author of ''Cookwise'' (William Morrow, 1997). The recipe in ''The Joy of Cooking''  instructs the cook to beat the eggs in an electric mixer for a full five minutes before adding the flour. But after several failed batches of cookies (some beaten for as much as 10 minutes), I found that this is not  enough. In ''The Martha Stewart Cookbook'' (Clarkson Potter, 1995), a similar recipe calls for a full 30 minutes of beating! Desperate for some success, I set the timer and tried it,  using a standing mixer. This worked, the cookies inflating as if on cue into perfect round pillows.    There is another problem with this recipe, however. It calls for the batter to be left out at room temperature to dry for 18 hours (10 hours in ''The Martha Stewart Cookbook''). This runs counter to current food safety guidelines, which recommend that eggs not be left out of the refrigerator for more than two hours. When I tried making the cookies  without the drying time, they came out as hard, pale coins instead of  light, puffed clouds, whether I beat them for 30 minutes or not. So please  use discretion if you want to make these cookies.    Preparing Hazelnuts    Q. I received five pounds of hazelnuts in the shell. Is there an easy way to remove the tough shells other than cracking each one with a nutcracker? How do I store them?    A. Cracking the nuts individually with a nutcracker really is the best way to open them, advises the Hazelnut Marketing Board, since nutcrackers remove the shell without too much damage to the nut. This is especially important with hazelnuts, which after cracking are often roasted or parboiled to remove the papery skins that surround the nut meat.    To simultaneously roast and skin the shelled nuts, bake them in a 350-degree oven for about 12 minutes until golden (or in the microwave for 3 to 4 minutes), then wrap the hot nuts in a rough terry cloth kitchen towel. Let steam for five minutes, then use the towel to rub off the skins. Patches of skin may still cling to some of the nuts","excerpt":"this is normal, and those nuts can be used.    If you prefer your nuts perfectly skinless, (for instance, if you need them for a garnish), you can boil the cracked nuts for five minutes in a pot of water spiked with a teaspoon of baking soda. When the nuts cool, the skins will slip right off. To recrisp the nuts, which get soggy after boiling, bake them at 325 degrees for five minutes, or longer for a roasted flavor; and for a golden brown color, bake about 15 minutes.    Unshelled nuts can keep for several years when stored at a cool room temperature (between 55 and 65 degrees). Once they are shelled, store them in the refrigerator for up to a year, or in the freezer for up to two years.    Hazelnuts are wonderful to eat out of hand as a snack, mixed into cookie doughs and cake batters, made into chocolate candies and spreads or chopped and used as a crunchy garnish for all kinds of sweet and savory dishes.

The concert is not actually a recital, but the 50th-anniversary celebration of the Moscow Chamber Orchestra, which under its music director, Constantine Orbelian, will also play orchestral arrangements of Prokofiev's ''Visions Fugitives,'' Shostakovich's Chamber Symphony in C minor and Haydn's Symphony No. 49.

The lions and giraffes and hippopotamuses and even the native African tribes have been snatched from in front of his grinding camera by the safari teams from Hollywood. There isn't much left for the veteran but to follow and do it again.This is, at least, the indication of Armand Denis' latest African film, a color picture called \\"Below the Sahara,\\" which came to the Plaza yesterday. Virtually everything in it, from the lassoing of wild game at the start to the capture of a baby gorilla at the finish, has been seen before. The herds of wild elephants in the water, the slithering crocodiles, the towering giraffes, the dancing tribesmen—these are now as familiar as Deborah Kerr. This is not to say that they aren't graphic","excerpt":"this is simply to say that they aren't new.In making this latest documentary of the fauna of Africa, Mr. Denis was accompanied by a new traveling companion and wife. Michaela, an obvious novice and occasionally coy blonde, replaces his former associate and wife, Leila Roosevelt, who was with him in the making of \\"Dark Rapture\\" and other films. The best to be said for Michaela, as a frequent participant in the show, is that she is photogenic. As a naturalist, she appears all thumbs.And this may account for the casual and rather tame characteristics of the film, as much as the fact that the contents have most all been seen before. The trip through the big-game country, down along the South African coast (where gannets and penguins and sea-lions and other tractable creatures are observed), then up through the equatorial Congo to the home of a gorilla-hunting tribe seems a sight-seeing tour for Michaela more than an audacious quest for the remote. Indeed; the leisurely visits of the Denises to a couple of animal farms, maintained by plump professional hunters, rather set the tone of the film.A trace of Walt Disney True-Life-ism is also apparent in the style of cutting and musical scoring that are practiced here and there. Particularly one sequence in which pelicans are made to appear to be engaged in a ballet, to Viennese music, is most mindful of Disney's \\"Water Birds.\\" This is, indeed, in contrast to the style of Mr. Denis' previous films. It is notable that the picture was assembled by Jay Bonafield and Douglas Travers for RKO-Pathé.To be sure, this may all be entertaining for those who fancy the colored travelogue. But it does lack the savagery and terror of Africa that it claims.

For this generation conspicuously lacks that eloquent air of bereavement which made so many of the exploits of the Lost Generation symbolic actions. Furthermore, the repeated inventory of shattered ideals, and the laments about the mud in moral currents, which so obsessed the Lost Generation does not concern young people today. They take it frighteningly for granted. They were brought up in these ruins and no longer notice them. They drink to \\"come down\\" or \\"get high,\\" not to illustrate anything. Their excursions into drugs or primiscuity come out of curiosity, not disillusionment. \\n\\n     Only the most bitter among them would call their reality a nightmare and protest that they have indeed lost something of the future. But ever since they  were old enough to imagine one, that has been in jeopardy anyway. The absence of personal and social values is to them, not a revelation shaking the ground beneath them, but a problem demanding a day-to-day solution. How to live seems to them much more crucial than why. And it is precisely at this point that the copywriter and the hot-rod driver meet, and their identical beatness becomes significant, for, unlike the Lost Generation, which was occupied with the loss of faith, the Beat Generation is becoming more and more occupied with the need for it. As such, it is a disturbing illustration of Voltaire's reliable old joke: \\"If there were no God, it would be necessary to invent Him.\\" Not content to bemoan His absence, they are busily and haphazardly inventing totems for Him  on all sides. . . . 1950's: Nov. 16, 1952","excerpt":"This Is the Beat Generation"},{"year":"1931","title":"Dornier DO-S DORNIER HAS NEW FLYING BOAT","excerpt":"THIS IS THE BIG LITTLE BROTHER OF THE GIANT DO-X"},{"year":"1931","title":"No-jury art show CHICAGO'S NO-JURY SHOW","excerpt":"This Is the Biggest Since 1926 and Artistically the Most Sound--Nudes Predominate"},{"year":"2012","title":"Physicists are crunching new data in the search for the Higgs boson","excerpt":"this is the boson’s last stand.

Giants Hope for Upset of 49ers"},{"year":"1992","title":"THE contest for the future of South Africa seems, even on good days, like a duel of schizophrenics. Both the white Government and the African National Congress are torn by conflicting impulses of civility and confrontation. Last week, on a very bad day at a razor-wire checkpoint near the town of Bisho, each side put forward its belligerent half. The outcome was grimly predictable, and sufficiently chilling that now, mercifully, the conciliatory halves may have their turn.   Within the African National Congress, the divide is between the romantic militancy born of the liberation movement that the congress was during its 30 years of banishment, and the prudent pragmatism of the governing party that the congress hopes to become. These are not simply rival factions but rival instincts that coexist to some degree in many congress leaders. The 'Leipzig Option'    Last week the Bastille-stormers were personified by Ronnie Kasrils, a thickset, kinetic white Communist who fought in the congress's armed underground in the days when ordinary political avenues were foreclosed. The occasion was the sort of \\"Leipzig option\\" mobilization that Mr. Kasrils had long promoted, only to be overruled by the pragmatists. But as frustration mounted in the black townships, the congress's mood had swung toward militancy. Top leaders of the congress endorsed a march aimed at occupying Bisho, the campus-sized capital of the ostensibly independent black homeland called Ciskei, and toppling its military dictator.   As the main column of marchers marked time at the border, Mr. Kasrils was assigned to lead a breakaway group in a flanking maneuver. The group sprinted toward the city center through a gap left -- temptingly, and no doubt deliberately -- in the fence, and straight into an ambush by several hundred machine guns of the Ciskei army.   The white Government of President F. W. de Klerk has its own split personality. There is the Rubicon-crossing, apartheid-disavowing, make-nice Government that craves the world's respect, and that promises majority rule. And there is the Red-baiting, divide-and-rule, make-war Government that shudders at the prospect of rule by the black majority","excerpt":"this is the Government that tolerates (if it does not actually orchestrate) the police torture, vigilante murder and homeland despotism that keep that majority from coalescing.   On Monday, while the make-nice Mr. de Klerk was occupied at a conference on the fine points of federalism in the forthcoming nonracial South Africa, his make-war surrogate at the Bisho border was Brigadier Oupa J. Gqozo, master of Ciskei. Mr. de Klerk supplies the brigadier with guns and comforts and advisers; the brigadier, in turn, does all he can to rattle the African National Congress in a region that has traditionally been its stronghold. When Mr. Kasril's young following charged through that inviting gap in the fence, Brigadier Gqozo's soldiers opened fire with abandon.   In simpler times, the consequences of such a massacre would have been clear-cut: worldwide opprobrium heaped upon Mr. de Klerk, calls from South African white liberals for sanctions against the regime, perhaps a surge of fresh martyrs to the barricades.   But these are more ambiguous times. Although, in fact, little has changed on the ground -- the black majority is still impoverished, separate and disenfranchised -- perceptions have changed profoundly. By disowning the ideology of racial oppression, Mr. de Klerk has persuaded much of the world to judge him in ordinary political terms rather than moral absolutes. By entering the political realm, the African National Congress has conceded that it will no longer be judged solely on the justice of its grand cause; it will be judged on its fitness to govern.   Mr. de Klerk nowadays scores points with many whites -- not just his own party, but moderates and liberals who acknowledge the legitimacy of the A.N.C.'s claims to power -- when he hammers at the continuing influence of Communists in the congress leadership and chides the organization for descending from purity of principle into political expediency.   A case in point is the question of homeland dictators.  Brigadier Gqozo, the target of last week's fatal march, is the unelected ruler of a purportedly independent Xhosa tribal homeland, carved out of South Africa as an apartheid dumping ground for unwanted blacks. He lives on subsidies from the South African Government and is accused by his political rivals of suppressing political freedoms.   Exactly the same can be said of Maj. Gen. Bantu Holomisa, leader of the neighboring homeland of Transkei. But General Holomisa, a more adroit politician, has thrown his allegiance to the African National Congress and allows it to operate freely on his territory. The congress is in no hurry to force him out; on the contrary, he is sometimes touted as a future head of the South African Army under an A.N.C. government. The attitude toward General Holomisa is roughly: He may be a despot but he's our despot.   Mr. de Klerk huffs that this is hypocrisy. More accurately, it is realpolitik, and there is plenty of it here to obscure the clear-cut moral distinctions of the past as South Africa makes its way to the new order.   By the current standards, neither side emerged a winner from last week's encounter. The Government, which tried mightily to shift the blame to Mr. Kasrils and, failing that, to the brigadier, was almost universally condemned as ruthless and cynical. But the congress did not get off lightly either. Many normally sympathetic white liberals saw the charge on Bisho as a reversion to the tactics of revolution. The Electoral Tactic    \\"The A.N.C. doesn't need to storm the Bastille in Ciskei,\\" wrote Allister Sparks, a journalist with strong pro-congress sympathies, in The Star. \\"It needs only to wait for an election and Gqozo will go the way of all corrupt political flesh.\\"   Indeed, said Phillip van Niekerk of The Weekly Mail, if the congress leaders were to start thinking like politicians rather than revolutionaries, they might prefer to keep the unpopular brigadier around, to help galvanize their voters.   The congress responds that Government-backed surrogates like Mr. Gqozo impede their ability to compete fairly in future elections. This is surely true. But as Mr. Sparks points out, the A.N.C. cannot get on an electoral footing while it is playing liberation movement, and as an organization out of power it can probably never hope to out-electioneer Mr. de Klerk, whose advantages include not only the police and the Gqozos but the state broadcasting network.   Mr. Sparks argues that it is in the congress's interest to set aside dreams of Leipzig and press for elections as quickly as possible.   \\"The playing field is far from level, but it will only grow more so with delay,\\" Mr. Sparks said in a conversation last week. \\"They've got to get a handle on power before anything can happen. Once the elections are out of the way, and the surrogates are gone or cut down to size, then they can get down to negotiating a new constitution, knowing clearly who speaks for whom.\\"   Neither side admits to being even marginally in the wrong at Bisho. Mr. de Klerk, at a press conference Wednesday, never even suggested that firing thousands of rounds without warning into a crowd that is fleeing in panic might constitute excessive force.   But by the end of the week, Mr. de Klerk, conceding a point the congress had pressed for months, said that something must be done about the violence before the transition can resume. The A.N.C. said that if Mr. de Klerk means it, the congress is prepared to resume negotiations broken off in June -- first on violence, but ultimately on the formation of an interim government.   Both sides, it seemed, had been sobered by their glimpse of where their bellicose halves could lead them.

It was a music that emphasized the soloist rather than the ensemble, a music intended to be played by small groups. The conventional wisdom at the time was that big bands were a thing of the past.   Mr. Henderson, one of the outstanding tenor saxophonists of his generation, quickly emerged as a leading light in this small-group milieu. But he was also drawn to the big-band format, which to him represented a challenge rather than an anachronism. By 1967 he had begun working on ways to translate some of his musical ideas to the format, and that year he and the trumpeter Kenny Dorham formed their own big band.   The band stayed together for about five years (Dorham left after a year and died in 1972), but hardly anyone besides its own members ever heard it. It performed in public a few times and came close to recording an album, but it was primarily a rehearsal band, an ensemble whose main purpose was simply to get together and work on music for the sheer joy of getting together and working on music.   \\"After a while I started to get more busy with my quartet, quintet or sextet, whatever the gig called for at the time, and I put the big-band activity on the shelf,\\" Mr. Henderson said in a recent interview. \\"I have some tapes of those rehearsals, and maybe every five or six years I listen to a few minutes of them and sort of wallow in nostalgia for a while, saying, 'What a great band that was.' \\" Original Arrangements    Listeners will have a rare opportunity to judge for themselves tomorrow night at 8 at Alice Tully Hall when Mr. Henderson and a 17-piece ensemble, including many former members of his rehearsal band, resurrect his original arrangements. He will be joined by Freddie Hubbard, a fellow master of the small-group idiom and one of the most influential trumpeters in jazz, who will perform new arrangements of some of his best-known compositions. And on Monday Mr. Henderson, with Mr. Hubbard as his special guest, will take the big band into the studio to record an album for the Verve label.   \\"This situation is a chance to complete the thought, so to speak,\\" Mr. Henderson said. \\"It's the first chance I've had to really get back to that band in a good 20 years. I didn't want to get the charts and rewrite them to fit today's concept","excerpt":"this is the way the music was then, and it didn't really get the proper exposure at the time.\\"   Mr. Hubbard admitted that unlike Mr. Henderson, he \\"never used to be interested in writing for a big band.\\" But he has taken the plunge, writing an arrangement of his composition \\"Thermo.\\" (Other arrangers, notably Slide Hampton, have contributed to his segment of the program.) He said he saw tomorrow night's concert as a chance to \\"let people hear what Joe's tunes and my tunes sound like with the different harmonies enlarged.\\"   \\"I am excited myself about hearing my compositions done like this,\\" he added.   The 53-year-old trumpeter also described the concert as a way for \\"some of the legendary jazz artists who are still alive and kicking\\" to \\"give a message to these young kids about how this music was and how it should be,\\" a not-so-subtle reference to the new generation of jazz musicians who derive much of their inspiration from the music he, Mr. Henderson and others have been making for 30 years.   \\"It makes me feel funny to hear them playing ideas that I was playing in the 60's,\\" Mr. Hubbard said. \\"At the time, we were creating it; it was an experimental thing. The way they're playing it and phrasing it now, it's very clean, but it doesn't have the same spirit.\\"   \\"It would be good for some of them to come to the concert,\\" he added, \\"and hear what it's supposed to sound like.\\" Creators, Not Clones    Mr. Henderson, who is 54, is considerably more soft-spoken than his colleague, but he expressed similar sentiments. \\"It's always nice to have somebody accept your music and try to create styles of arranging, composing and playing based on yours,\\" he said. \\"What could be a greater compliment? But when my contemporaries and I arrived on the scene, we did a lot in terms of expanding the art form and coming out with something that was uniquely our own on the various instruments that we played.   \\"A lot of the youngsters seem to be kind of satisfied with just being clones of people like Freddie and myself, Herbie Hancock and Ron Carter. I certainly hope they grow beyond that. They have to keep going on and seek their own voices. I'm not so sure that they won't do this, but right now it seems they're kind of satisfied to do what we did 20 years ago. I want them to want to seek their own individual styles, their own fingerprints. They have a responsibility to the art form to expand it.\\"   Mr. Henderson himself appears eager to keep growing. \\"Having the chance to hear this music again has done so much for me,\\" he said. \\"It's got me inspired again to do more writing. I want to explore some of the ideas that have grown in my head over the past 20 years that require a big-band format. I'm kind of back at letter A again.\\"   Tickets for tomorrow night's concert are $25 and $30. They are available at the Alice Tully Hall box office or through Centercharge, (212) 721-6500.

Silicosis asks.    Sili, as he is known, is a slim young man with serious eyes set deeply into a delicate face. He's the newest member of a hacker collective known as L0pht (pronounced ''loft''). He becomes visibly uncomfortable when asked to talk about himself. He gives his age as ''mid-20's'' and then clams up. But when the conversation moves to hacking, Sili turns voluble: ''I think it's a thrill to look at a program and figure out how to make that program do something that it was never designed to do in the first place. There's the challenge.''     We sit down at a computer monitor while Sili explains his latest discovery. By mimicking messages that typically flow between computers on a network, he can reach out to almost anyone running Windows 95, 98 or 2000 in a large corporate environment, or anyone using a cable modem, and forcibly disconnect them from the Web. In a demonstration of this, he types a one-line command on his computer and hits the return key with a flourish. Sure enough, the computer across the room, which seconds before had been connected to M.I.T.'s server, is now off line. The same technique, Sili explains, can be used to take information flowing between the Web and your neighbor's computer and reroute it into your own. A clever hacker could capture a neighbor's banking transactions, passwords or credit-card information.    Sili published his research on L0pht's Web site in mid-August. The report was covered in the computer publication Infoworld and the on-line magazine ZDNet. At the time, a Microsoft spokesman, instead of denouncing L0pht, expressed the hope to reporters that the group would ''design a more secure version of the protocol'' -- a hackerproof set of operating instructions for the computer.    This request strikes Sili as especially outrageous. ''Why doesn't Ralph Nader just redesign the Corvair?'' he asks.     Nader is something of a role model at L0pht, a confederation of eight young hackers who position themselves, incredibly enough, as a consumer-advocacy group. But L0pht's tactics are a bit unorthodox: breaking into software systems and then posting instructions on how to do so on the Web, where they can be picked up by software designers and malicious hackers alike. Intrigued, I paid a visit to their workshop.    L0pht's ''laboratory'' is the second floor of a ramshackle warehouse in suburban Boston. Predictably, the door to the lab has a sign for the pizza man -- ''Domino's Knock Loudly.''    The eight men who make up L0pht allow themselves to be identified only by their screen names: Dr. Mudge, Space Rogue, Dildog, Brian Oblivion, Kingpin, Silicosis, Weld Pond and John Tan. They look to be in their 20's or 30's, but their six-room suite is an adolescent geek's fantasy clubhouse. One wall is papered with antiquated circuit boards while another has a signed picture from Julie, Penthouse Pet. Junk food in the cupboard is taken seriously. There are three different kinds of Cheez-Its: hot and spicy, plain and white cheddar.    The warehouse brims with more than 200 computers ranging from state-of-the-art Sun and Digital workstations to nostalgia pieces like Commodore 64's and Apple IIe's. Black cables, yellow cables and jumbles of thin rainbow-colored wires drip from the ceiling, all jacked in to steel racks of oscilloscopes, radio transmitters, D.S.L. modems, I.S.D.N. modems, half-opened C.P.U.'s and a 50-foot roof antenna. The warehouse also contains several small-scale dummy computer networks.    L0pht's ''research'' consists of trying to break into these internal systems. Upon discovering a security flaw in commercial-network software, the L0phties publish an advisory on their Web site. The advisory is a double-edged sword: a detailed description of the flaw -- enough information for other hackers to duplicate the ''exploit'' -- and a solution that tells network administrators how to close the loophole.    L0pht's unorthodox methods have garnered praise from very unlikely quarters. Sixteen months ago, L0pht appeared before the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the United States Senate. Senator Fred Thompson introduced L0pht not as a ''gang'' nor even a ''group,'' but, translating for Washington pols, as a ''hacker think tank.''    L0pht wowed the committee by reeling off an alarming list of security holes in public and private systems. After the presentation, Senator Lieberman gushed, ''It is probably not what you came to hear, but actually, I think you are performing an act of very good citizenship and I appreciate it.'' Lieberman went on to compare L0pht, in a single sentence, to both Rachel Carson and Paul Revere. ''You are performing a valuable service to your country,'' Thompson added, ''and we appreciate that and want you to continue.''    The National Security Council is equally bullish on L0pht. I met the N.S.C.'s director of information protection, Jeffrey Hunker, at Defcon, an annual three-day ''conference'' attracting more than 2,000 computer hackers from around the country. Hunker had come to talk about President Clinton's initiatives on computer security (and to spy on hackers, if you believe the whispers). He surprised me by raving about the group's technical sophistication. ''L0pht has carved out an interest-ing niche for itself,'' he added, ''and for similar-minded people -- white-hatted hackers. Their objective is basically to help improve the state of the art in security and to be a gadfly, so to speak -- to identify products that have vulnerabilities and make certain those vulnerabilities get fixed.''    When I told L0pht about Hunker's comments, they rolled their eyes, saying, ''You're not going to publish that, are you?''    For one thing, they had no wish to be identified as favorites of the N.S.C., since that might jeopardize their standing among so-called black-hat, or malicious, hackers. ''We are all extremely ethical and moral,'' one member allowed, ''but we're not white-hat hackers. We have our own moral and ethical standards'' -- the term is gray-hat.    It's not hard to spot the reasons for the moral ambiguity. In their off hours, Mudge and Dildog are members of Cult of the Dead Cow, a black-hat hacker group that recently released Back Orifice 2000 (bo2k), a computer program that enables a hacker to control another computer from afar. (The name is a crude play on Microsoft's Back Office Server, a program that allows a legitimate administrator to, among other things, control another computer on a network.) But unlike Back Office, bo2k is ''invisible,'' meaning that a hacker can spy on another user, even change files, without the user's knowledge. Dildog, one of bo2k's authors, euphemistically describes it as ''a shy program.'' Jason Garms, the former head of Microsoft's security-response team, is a bit more direct, labeling b02k ''a malicious program, with malicious intent.''    Perhaps because of their ties to the black-hat community, L0pht members refuse to be identified, although they will let themselves be photographed. As Space Rogue explains (and any hacker knows), pictures are next to useless if you're trying to dig up private data on someone.    When L0pht testified before the Senate, members would not accept checks for hotel and travel expenses. As with members of the Witness Protection Program who have come before the Senate, they were reimbursed with cash. Senator John Glenn even signed pictures -- with the group's screen names: ''To Dr. Mudge. . . . To Space Rogue. . . . To Weld Pond.''    ''Open up the raincoat to expose all the little parts,'' is how Mudge, smiling, describes L0pht's ethos. Mudge will not disclose his age, but mid-30's seems a good guess. He claims a college degree in music with further course work in computer science. Mudge says that early experimenting with computers led to informal warnings from certain ''three-letter agencies.'' He wears his hair below his shoulders, sports a goatee and favors faded jeans and a T-shirt. In his Senate testimony he claimed to have given training seminars at NASA and the National Security Agency.    Mudge frankly admits that he'll answer anyone's technical questions about hacking. ''If a black hat approaches us and says, Hey, this is the project or problem I'm looking at . . . we'll talk to them, no problem. And if a government agency approaches us and says, How do you do this, or, How does this work, we'll talk to them.''    Of course, this laissez-faire attitude has its costs. Mudge says: ''Full disclosure is something we had to grapple with for a long time. The flip side is that critics say, 'You're giving people tools that can actually do bad things.' That is absolutely true. It's got a lot of nasty side effects.''    For instance: last December, a hacker magazine called Phrack disclosed a flaw in a network program called Cold Fusion. (Network programs help manage computers that are linked together). In April of this year, Weld Pond -- an older, thoughtful L0pht programmer -- discovered a second, more serious way to exploit the flaw.    Weld immediately published an advisory on L0pht.com prescribing a fix. Weld's report also contained enough detail to explain the flaw to so-called ''script kiddies'' -- young, malicious hackers with limited technical expertise who are among the most avid readers of L0pht's advisories. In the span of three weeks, according to PC Week, hackers inserted bogus text and images on at least 100 Cold Fusion systems, including those of NASA, the Army and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.    So why didn't L0pht contact Allaire, the small Cambridge, Mass., software firm that makes Cold Fusion, before releasing an advisory? The reason, say Weld and the other L0phties, is that vendors usually sweep tips from hackers under the rug. Vendors, claims L0pht, don't want customers to think software has flaws. ''We were trained by the vendors to go public,'' says Mudge, ''to give them a black eye.''    With an attitude like this, it's tempting to blame Weld Pond, especially since L0pht's advisory led to more security breaches than would have occurred had nothing ever been reported. It's not enough to claim, as Weld does, that ''We try to stay somewhat neutral -- we're not on the vendor's side, we're not on the hacker's side. When we release the tools, they can be used for good or bad. It's up to the individuals to have morals.''    Mudge is currently writing a paper on a longtime hobbyhorse of his: the vulnerability of electrical power grids to hacker attacks. While the computers that control these power grids are not directly connected to the Internet, Mudge thinks a hacker could still turn out the nation's lights because utility companies have left the keys to their computers under the proverbial doormat.    Mudge tells me that careless utility employees often put internal documents on public servers -- perhaps to access them from home or while on the road. Sometimes, Mudge claims, the documents explain how to access the central computers. Central computers ''might have no attachment to the Internet,'' he says, ''other than the fact that somebody put up a document on the Internet describing how to get to it and how to use it.'' Mudge pauses. ''Well, that's just as good.''    Mudge has written a program to scan utility companies' Web sites for words like ''confidential'' or ''password.'' ''I'm not breaking any laws by doing this, I'm just grabbing public stuff,'' he is quick to point out. ''They don't realize that they're putting it up there for the world to see.''    He shows me a file downloaded from a large utility company that contains a presentation on company security. Next he opens a file full of phone numbers from another utility company. ''It sounds almost science-fictionist,'' he cautions, ''but with these numbers here I'd be able to turn off their entire grid.'' The phone numbers, he explains, connect to modems linked to the central switches that determine where electricity flows. ''If I don't publish this information,'' Mudge claims, ''someone else will come along and do the same thing, with less ethical goals. Now you can see a situation where people are dying because of these corporations' stupidity. At that point, who's to blame?''    Given the stakes, Mudge intends to relax his commitment to so-called full disclosure. ''It's uncool,'' he says, for utility companies to ''learn about a problem by reading it in the newspaper.'' That's why he plans to alert companies in advance, so they can close vulnerabilities before the news is made public on L0pht's Web site.    Like Nader, the L0pht members can get a bit preachy on the subject of ethics. ''Any of us could leave L0pht right now and take six-figure jobs,'' Mudge says. ''The fact that we don't and we're on the ramen-noodle, mac-and-cheese diet, that speaks for our ethics right there. It's not a job for us","excerpt":"this is what drives us through life.''    While Mudge's self-righteousness may be justified up to a point, there are also more prosaic reasons for working at L0pht. Freedom to do whatever you want, for instance. Silicosis and Brian Oblivion are installing a motor-driven satellite dish on the warehouse roof. They hope to capture ground-to-space communications from the Space Shuttle and high-resolution images of the earth broadcast from satellites. The justification? It's cool. Silicosis adds, ''It impresses my girlfriend.''    Space Rogue -- a sort of young Archie Bunker figure, to the extent that an Archie Bunker figure can be young -- sticks closer to earth when asked how he ended up at L0pht. ''I did one semester in college, said the hell with this and got out. Controlled learning environments have never been my strong point.'' L0pht gave him a place to pursue projects at his own pace.    Mostly, Space Rogue seems to like L0pht for the camaraderie. ''I moved to Boston in 1990,'' he says, ''and I almost immediately met all these people on line on local bulletin boards. L0pht started shortly thereafter in fall '91. So I'd already known these people awhile, even face to face. The on-line world at the time was very small.''    Mudge recalls that the group took off when members moved their computers from their living rooms to a small loft space in Boston. (All but one of the founders, Brian Oblivion, have since left.) L0pht soon added members and moved to a larger suburban warehouse four years ago. It has also started a consulting business on the side called L0pht Heavy Industries.    L0pht is not without critics, of course. ''While L0pht puts on the Robin Hood mantle of fighting the big computer companies,'' a senior programmer at Microsoft tells me, ''their only victims are the little people that are customers'' -- the people who purchase products like Windows 2000.    Microsoft has been on the business end of several L0pht advisories, most notably when Mudge and Weld demonstrated how to decrypt passwords from computers running Microsoft's NT operating system. Jason Garms, the former head of Microsoft's security-response team, admits that hackers have a role in creating secure software. But he's wary of the Darwinian notion that hackers will, by actively looking for flaws, expose inferior products. He likens it to improving public safety by painting a target on everyone's head.    I mentioned Garms's criticism to the L0pht members, who were equally dismissive. If gray-hat hackers stopped searching for vulnerabilities, L0pht believes, a black-hat hacker would find them sooner or later. It's better to get rid of flaws than hope no one finds them. The N.S.C.'s Hunker shares this belief -- the hackers are already out there'' -- which is why he applauds L0pht for keeping vendors honest.    The senior Microsoft programmer also warns that Mudge and his colleagues, for all their highfalutin apologia, are motivated mostly by naked ego: ''I am certain,'' he says, ''that the primary motivation of these people is simple self-gratification and justification.''    I asked the L0pht members whether ego played a part in their ethical reasoning. Weld Pond replied that, by assuming pseudonyms, they more or less deny themselves the benefits of celebrity. ''When I walk down the street,'' he says, ''no one knows I'm Weld Pond.''    But at Defcon, the annual hacker convention, it was quite clear that everyone knew Weld, Mudge, Space Rogue and Dildog. L0pht members have become, as Mudge notes wryly, ''rock stars of the computer underground.'' That they help malicious hackers as well as the Feds and big business hasn't hurt their popularity among the outlaws.    On the other hand, L0pht's poorly hidden hunger for the spotlight shouldn't obscure the truly fascinating work they've done. Socially important research is perfectly compatible with, and perhaps inseparable from, love of celebrity, as James Watson has made admirably clear. Say what you will, there is no denying that L0pht's advisories have improved computer security even as they have harmed corporations and government agencies.    No one doubts that information security is going to become an increasingly critical topic as the ordinary economy moves into the digital age. In their grander moments, L0pht's members hope to become digital Ralph Naders, making sure that the software behind the transition is as safe as manufacturers say.    The idea of eight computer hackers in a dingy warehouse insuring the safety of the information age may sound a little farfetched. But sometimes hackers eventually direct their curiosity toward laudable ends. Take, for example, the two young hackers who engineered a small blue box in the early 1970's that allowed free long-distance calls when placed near a telephone receiver. The two enterprising techies went door to door in the Berkeley dorms, selling the devices. Their names? Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, future founders of Apple Computer.

Actors I Hate    The Rebel: This is almost exclusively a white male actor, most often the product of an upper-middle-class suburb; due primarily to the marketability of his hair style, he will rapidly acquire a chunk of Malibu beachfront and a $3 million barn in New Hampshire, a fully renovated retreat that allows him, on talk shows, to claim he's a farmer. This actor insists on playing only moody outcasts, sensitive, creative yet monosyllabic dudes from the Kerouac side of the tracks. His notion of rebellious behavior is limited to his choice of motorcycle and bandana; he would never play anyone truly unpopular or persecuted, merely someone glamorously misunderstood. He will play any character named Bo or Maverick, but you will never catch him playing, say, someone with AIDS, or any sort of teacher. He will take on a genuinely challenging role only if his career is in trouble, and it's all he can get; after that, it's right back to charismatic drifters, alienated race-car drivers and rookie cops with attitude problems.

You'll find folks bellying up to the counter, sipping grog and confronting their own middle ages. The brewery (120 Wilkinson Street, 315-476-4250; www.middleagesbrewing.com) holds free beer-tasting sessions every day but Sunday. Regulars also fill up their half-gallon brown jugs, called growlers, at the tap (prices run $7 to $12). Taste, but don't guzzle.

They are memorizing their lines for the weekend open-mike night at the Onajava Coffee & Soul Cafe. This night, as a 16-year-old rapper takes the stage, his mom cries, ''That's my baby!'' from her table. The stream of poetry, soul, rap, gospel and jazz starts after 10 p.m. Free admission, two-drink minimum for open-mike nights. The $3.95 cappuccino comes in a cup tall as your forearm.

In a town of great homey diners, why eat at a suburban supermarket? Simple. At ''Weggy's'' you can snag a five-pound bag of Hinerwadel's Salt Potatoes ($2.99), the blue-collar delicacy that is to Syracuse what chicken wings are to Buffalo. They look like doughnut holes, but don't be deceived: humanity has never devised a finer delivery system for butter and salt.    11:30 a.m.  8 -- A Delicate Moment    Designed by I. M.

Admission is free, but a $5 donation is delicately suggested. The museum devotes a whole room to the native son Gustav Stickley (1858-1942) and his Mission oak furniture.    2:30 p.m.  9 -- Deep Green    Across suburbia, green water can mean a fried squirrel in the pool filter. But in the expansive Green Lakes State Park, a 20-minute drive from Syracuse (7900 Green Lakes Road, Fayetteville; 315-637-6111; $7 a car from Memorial Day to Labor Day), two clear green lakes get their brilliant color from limestone bedrock. They plunge to depths of 198 feet -- early settlers thought them bottomless. Impress folks by announcing that these lakes are meromictic, which means the upper and lower levels don't mix. Hike 20 miles of trails, swim or picnic.    6 p.m.  10 -- A Full Plate and Glass    You know those hoity-toity bistros, where you can spend $100 and still want to top off at Taco Bell on the ride home? They got chased out of Syracuse. Pascale Wine Bar and Restaurant (204 West Fayette Street, 315-471-3040), with live jazz and walls of eclectic art, serves pooh-bahs and proletarians. The Game Sampler ($28) features antelope medallions, roasted squab, rabbit sausage and wild huckleberry sauce.    10 p.m.  11 -- Late Shift    Years ago, when Shifty's (1401 Burnet Avenue, 315-474-0048; www.shiftysbar.com) changed hands, the deal stipulated that it remain a neighborhood bar offering live music. There, the bands play for friends, fans and the former hippies who shoot pool in the back. One night last year, the comedian and Syracusan Tom Kenny -- the voice of SpongeBob -- returned to front a blues band. At one point, he slithered across the entire place on his hands and knees, singing ''Do the Crawl.'' Drink the ''Shifty 50'' tour of beers, but not in one night, of course.    Sunday    10 a.m.  12 -- Land of the Flea    Never say junk. Say ''merchandise with a past.'' Four pavilions of distinctive treasures await you at the Central New York Regional Flea Market (2100 Park Street, 315-422-8647): odd lots, factory mistakes and future antiques. Really, didn't you always want a watercolor portrait of Vin Diesel? Two for $10? Make an offer!    3 p.m.  13 -- The Central New York Sound    When the guitars begin, bodies thrash, fists pump and shouts of ''HardCORE! HardCORE!'' fill the Westcott Community Center (826 Euclid Avenue). Headlining this day was Path of Resistance, the remnants of Earth Crisis, a 90's straightedge band that made Syracuse a center for animal rights, vegan lifestyles and music too intense for boomer eardrums. The straightedge scene may have faded, but hardcore shows regularly pop up in community centers or even vacant houses. Track them at www.315hardcore.com or on the wall at Halo Tattoos and Bodypiercing (171 Marshall Street). Just don't stand too close when the music starts, or you'll spend your 37th hour in Syracuse in an emergency ward.    THE BASICS    Rust Belt Renewal       Round-trip flights between New York City and Syracuse start about $155. Amtrak takes about five and a half hours to make the trip, usually for $78 one way.

Wrangler does not ship its Cowboy Cut jeans to the Northeast, where the company says no market for the style exists, but in Texas the jeans are as common as gun racks. Nearly every detail of these jeans, originally designed 50 years ago by a Philadelphia tailor known as Rodeo Ben, is based on the very specific demands of real-life cowboys. Rodeo Ben sewed 12 prototypes before one finally satisfied all of Wrangler's requirements, which is why the number 13 is stamped on the inside label.

And since the rear pockets are positioned a bit higher, the wearer also won't be, in the words of one cowboy, \\"a-settin' on your wallet.\\" Finally, the inseams on Wranglers are rolled and soft, unlikely to chafe a wearer who is on horseback all day.\\nTHE REAL REASON: Wrangler uses the biggest, toughest zipper in the industry, a No. 5, so that the pants can function like a reinforced corset, meeting the demand for the tightest possible fit. The higher- positioned rear pockets accentuate the positive, and to ease the eye-popping sensation somewhat for the wearer, the hole for the top fly button can be safely cut to the very edge of the seam, giving a crucial half-inch of breathing space. This bit of cheating is well hidden, of course, beneath the belt buckle.\\nWHY WOMEN PREFER TO WEAR MEN'S WRANGLERS: Not only are the jeans cut so that they hold the hips in and curve the rear out, but most wearers also appreciate that tiny bit of roominess in the crotch.\\nHOW THEY SHOULD BE WORN: Cowboys buy them in threes: one pair a size larger for practice riding, one pair the correct size for rodeo competition and one pair a size too small to wear out at night. Whatever the size, the jeans must be way too long so that they drape heavily around the wearer's boots. A cowboy doesn't want to look lame in high-water pants while he's busy defying death, and neither should you.\\nLYNN SNOWDEN THING;\\nUrbane Cowboys Need Not Apply"},{"year":"1978","title":"If free agents symbolize the finance of baseball, rookies symbolize its romance.

At the center of this novel, set in a Hecht-and-MacArthur universe of curmudgeonly editors, swell dames and shimmering watering holes, two glossy magazines wage a circulation war in the pre-Depression twilight.   And Bear In Mind"},{"year":"1995","title":"The truth has taken it on the chin from a well-oiled, well-financed propaganda machine bent on perverting justice as it subverts the facts of the trial of a convicted cop killer, Mumia Abu-Jamal. The effort has been aided by lawyers who will say anything, no matter how false, to attract publicity, and by attention-seeking celebrities and spin doctors who attract it all too easily.\\n\\nThis we know from the trial record: In the early hours of Dec. 9, 1981, Danny Faulkner, a 26-year-old police officer in uniform, stopped a car driven by Mr. Abu-Jamal's brother, William Cook, in downtown Philadelphia. Mr. Cook began to struggle with Mr. Faulkner when the officer tried to handcuff him. Mr. Abu-Jamal, driving a cab in the area, arrived and, running up behind the officer, put a bullet in his back.\\n\\nBefore collapsing, Office Faulkner shot Mr. Abu-Jamal in the chest. Mr. Abu-Jamal went up to the supine officer and shot him between his eyes, killing him. Then he sat down on the curb, dropping his gun as the police arrived. The gun, registered in his own name, was loaded with .38-caliber high-velocity bullets.\\n\\nVirtually all of the small group of true believers who have turned the case into a crusade have never read the trial record","excerpt":"this makes it easy to justify siding with a convicted killer. No one, certainly not I, would quarrel with sincere opponents of the death penalty. Where the shrill chorus and I part company is when it tries to turn a murderer into a martyr.\\n\\nWhy haven't the media pressed the defense to explain how and why he was shot? How is it that his gun contained five spent cartridge cases of the very caliber and brand of bullet that killed Officer Faulkner? Why did Mr. Abu-Jamal refuse to allow his brother, an eyewitness, to testify at the trial? Why didn't Mr. Abu-Jamal ever deny shooting Officer Faulkner? The answers are obvious. He murdered him.\\n\\nBut truth would interfere with the orchestrated image that the killer, a self-styled prison journalist, is really a victim. Consider some of the falsehoods.\\n\\n* The Fleeing Stranger Theory.  The Abu-Jamal coterie claims that several witnesses saw the \\"real\\" shooter escape. The reality is that after years of empty assertions, the defense only recently presented testimony from these \\"witnesses.\\" Not one confirms the version put out by Mr. Abu-Jamal's publicists. Essential parts of their stories contradict one another and don't square with the physical vestiges of the crime. The only witnesses whose testimony agrees with the known facts came forward immediately after the crime. They saw Mr. Abu-Jamal kill the policeman.\\n\\n* The .44-Caliber Bullet Theory. Abu-Jamal supporters contend he couldn't be guilty because Officer Faulkner was killed with a .44-caliber bullet, not the .38-caliber bullet from Mr. Abu-Jamal's gun. This assertion is based on a handwritten note on a medical examiner's pre-autopsy worksheet. But the examiner who made the notation testified that he was no weapons expert and could not precisely measure the bullet. The real expert who examined the bullet determined conclusively that it was a .38 caliber. That bullet still exists. It has been made available to the defense, whose expert refuses to look at it but concedes that all the documentation supports the prosecution's evidence that the bullet is a .38. If the Abu-Jamal legal team could have disproved the expert assessment and shown that the .38 was a .44, it would have done so.\\n\\n* The Incompetent Counsel and Unfair Jury Theory. Mr. Abu-Jamal's supporters say he was forced to accept a novice lawyer, was given no money for preparations and was subjected to the whims of a racist jury. In fact, he was represented by an experienced former prosecutor who was not foisted on him but took the case at the request of one of Mr. Abu-Jamal's friends. The record shows that the court paid the lawyer, that the defense received additional public and private funds and that the lawyer hired an investigator who worked on the case for months before and during the trial. The jury was composed of blacks and whites chosen with Mr. Abu-Jamal's personal participation. They voted unanimously to convict him of first-degree murder and imposed the death sentence because he executed an officer in cold blood.\\n\\n* The Conspiracy Theory. The Abu-Jamal sympathizers theorize that any facts that disprove his claims must be lies cooked up by a conspiratorial band. They claim he was a famous journalist whom the police framed to silence his unpopular political views. In fact, at the time of the murder he was a high school dropout who had been fired from his radio job and was moonlighting as a cab driver. The notion that the police knew who he was -- that they conspired to let the \\"real\\" killer escape so that they could blame Mr. Abu-Jamal -- is ludicrous.\\n\\nThis crime was committed at a well-lighted intersection in full view of numerous people. When the police arrived at the scene almost immediately after the murder, the evidence of guilt, both physical and eyewitness, was there along with the perpetrator. There was no reason or opportunity to fabricate the pieces of evidence, all of which corroborated one another.\\n\\nThere is no question of guilt. Yes, this is a troubling case, but not because the \\"system\\" convicted an innocent man. It is troubling because it shows how easily the truth can be lost.

I tried several adhesives, but none held up for long. Some places will not stick down at all. Any suggestions?     A. There are a couple of things you did wrong. First, you should never use a wallpaper lining under a vinyl wallcovering, for the vinyl will pull the paper lining away from the wall. Second, you should not paint or prime a wallpaper or lining","excerpt":"this makes it very difficult to remove later.

Assuming it is leaves, is there any product I can pour in to get rid of them without harming the lawn, or must I rebuild the well?     A. I know of nothing you can pour in the well that will solve your problem. The only cure is to either uncover the well and clean it out, or to dig a new well and connect your gutters to it. To prevent this happening again, I suggest you cover the gutters with mesh guards so as to keep out leaves.

However, many homeowners repaint for purely esthetic reasons - because the old paint is dull and dingy-looking, or simply because the old finish looks dirty. This is in spite of the fact that the old paint film is still basically sound and could last for another couple of years while still providing adequate protection for the wood.

O. Scott, Brent Staples and David Brooks. The second death, of Frank Conroy, on April 6, was recorded more quietly. But Conroy, too, was a major presence in American literature -- less through his own writing, though his memoir ''Stop-Time'' is a classic of the genre, than through the contribution he made as the longtime director of the Writers' Workshop at the University of Iowa. When a former teacher there, the novelist James Salter, asked the Book Review if he might write an appreciation of Conroy, we encouraged him to go ahead. Salter's essay, ''The Writing Teacher,'' which appears on Page 31, evokes the spirit of Conroy (''tall, unflappable and urbane'') and also of the program he ran, rigorously and lovingly, for 18 years. It helped keep Iowa City, a small Midwestern river town, at the center of the literary universe -- a place where Nobel laureates came to read, and writers like John Cheever, Philip Roth, Kurt Vonnegut and Joy Williams evaluated student work and continued the conversation at local bars. How did Conroy prevent this most venerable of writing programs from becoming a processing plant? To begin with, he kept a close watch on who got in. He ''read every submission and made final decisions himself,'' Salter notes. ''It was the way great cities of Europe were built, not by committee but by royal decree.''

Also evident is his obsession with Uma Thurman: by far the most emotionally charged relationship in the movie is the one between the director and his star, who functions as his muse, idol, alter ego and fetish object. Her character, the Bride, is a former assassin whose former lover (that would be Bill) tried to kill her on her wedding day.

I showed the article to Mr. Renner, and he confirmed my supposition that only three mikes were used to record the orchestra. He, too, was puzzled by Mr. Rockwell's comment regarding multimiking.

For $135 a night we were installed in a comfortable and elegantly decorated junior suite, with two bathrooms and French doors to separate the main sleeping area from the sitting room and its convertible sofa bed. With an 11 percent tax, the total bill for two nights came to $299.70, leaving us with a meager $200 for other expenses; for couples on a weekend getaway the Regis and several other hotels in the area have double rooms for $89 a night plus tax. In the end, that $100 difference between a double room and a junior suite was sufficient to put us over our limit.

Griffith had a Hollywood-shaking idea -- get together some people who know movies and let them run the show. United Artists was born. Since those glory days, though, corporations and committees and accountants have taken over -- and their movies, alas, often look the part. But last week a grand cycle came round again as three men who indisputably know movies now -- Steven Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen -- joined forces to create a studio. The rest of Hollywood may soon look as if a \\"Jurassic Park\\" dinosaur had tromped through. Mr. Spielberg will stop making films for Universal, Mr. Katzenberg will probably raid the animation talent at Disney, his former home, Mr. Geffen will bring his production unit. And all that talent will flow to the new studio. A Novel Cash-Flow Problem  Every company should have such problems. Chrysler -- yes, the one that almost went under -- has been making so much money it's running out of mattresses to stuff it in. With buyers clamoring for its cars and Cherokees, its earnings reports are getting boring -- another quarter, another record. And again last week: $11.66 billion in revenues, $651 million in profits, both records. So, what to do with it? The company even has all it needs in its pension funds -- the first time since 1957. It could raise the dividend, it could buy back some stock. But it also hasn't forgotten how wet the rainy days can be.  The Car-Buying Minuet  What is it about new cars? When you buy anything else, you shop around, you find the best price, you pay it. Simple. (Or you don't shop around, you pay too much, you kick yourself.) With cars, though, a bizarre world has evolved -- meaningless price tags, complex formulas for figuring what the price should be and the dealer's profit. (But do you know the deli's profit on that bagel and coffee?) And then \\"no haggle\\" pricing, to make it all nice and simple. But nothing, of course, is simple -- last week it turned out that the Justice Department is investigating the whole idea of no-haggle pricing. What are they looking for? Price-fixing possibly. Or maybe, like the rest of us, they're just trying to figure out what's going on.  Lutece Super-Value Meals?  The bistros come and go, the temples of Tuesday's cuisine vanish by Wednesday. And then there's Lutece, as indestructible as the Brooklyn Bridge. But the bridge shook a bit last week: Andre Soltner sold Lutece. So is it any cause for alarm that the buyer, Ark Restaurants, owns less-illustrious establishments like Albuquerque Eats and B. Smith's? No, insists Ark's president","excerpt":"this pillar of French cuisine will remain intact. But -- a \\"but\\" always seems to sneak in about now -- \\"there may be room for enhancement,\\" he said, like a \\"Lutece Brasserie somewhere.\\" Stay off the Brooklyn Bridge. Toys Don't Kill? Think Again  Kids love toy guns; parents hate them. So guess who usually wins out: Toy guns were a $246 million business in this country last year. But parents' vague unease has turned to tangible fear lately, as one New York boy, then another, was shot by a police officer who mistook a toy gun for the real thing. Toys 'R' Us heard those shots loud and clear, and last week it said it would stop selling \\"realistic\\" toy guns; others, like Kay-Bee Toys, quickly followed suit. Toys 'R' Us had banished toy guns before, but later started selling guns in bright colors -- to mark them as fake. But kids started painting them to look real, so the issue exploded again.  Microsoft, On Top Again  Microsoft clearly intends to be master of everything it touches, and if it can't build what it needs, it won't hesitate to buy it. Its own personal-finance software has managed only 4 percent of the market. But Bill Gates probably can't even see numbers that small, so last week, he had Microsoft issue $1.5 billion in stock -- in the largest software acquisition ever -- to buy Intuit, whose Quicken software owns the market. So if more people take to writing checks and paying bills electronically, Microsoft could just tiptoe in with a tiny transaction fee, then gather those golden crumbs into quite a rich cake indeed. ECONOMY Making Economics a Game  There's a concept in economics called \\"perfect competition\\" -- the idea that businesses and nations exist in a vast state of nature, and the fittest will prevail by brute, faceless mathematical force. Some economists, though, think it's a bit murkier -- that something called \\"game theory\\" must be factored in. That theory takes into account the bluff and swagger, the backing and filling, of real-life competition -- a world, in short, in which rivals play a lot of \\"games,\\" possibly devious ones. Last week this economic school got a powerful blessing when the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science was awarded to three game-theory pioneers.  Lilco as Politics? Don't Be Silly  There's been talk of a state takeover of the Long Island Lighting Company for years, especially during the Shoreham mess. But it's naturally just a coincidence that Governor Cuomo proposed a takeover just last week -- a few weeks before his charmed political life could skid to a halt. Certainly it's not politics -- though the takeover would, by the by, lower rates for Lilco customers, among the nation's highest, by about 10 percent. George Pataki -- possibly munching some sour grapes as he witnessed, in living color, the joys of incumbency -- called it \\"the height of political opportunism.\\" But Mr. Cuomo insisted it was \\"for the public.\\" Follow the Bouncing Subsidy  One way to get cheap magazine subscriptions is to accept a cut-rate offer, not renew, then take another introductory offer. Companies could probably play that game, too, hopping from New York to Connecticut and back, following the tax break du jour. Last week, angry that Swiss Bank had been lured to Stamford, Mayor Giuliani started talking tough, saying that a 1991 tristate peace treaty had been broken and he'd start trying to entice companies away from Connecticut. New York, in fact, has just offered Viacom $15 million in tax breaks to stick around. Of course, as a Connecticut official pointed out, the whole region gets hurt by this tax-draining game.  No Inflation for Retirees  Don't mention inflation to people getting Social Security; there's none of it in their paychecks. When the consumer price numbers came in on Friday, the yearly increase added up to just 2.8 percent -- and that instantly became the magic number for 1995 Social Security increases. But for all that talk about lurking inflation, that's the third-smallest increase since the payments were pegged to price rises two decades ago. And the consumer-price data came on top of a surprising decline in producer prices reported the day before -- so, yet again, that feared price pressure isn't showing up on any radar. INTERNATIONAL A Weak Link: The Ruble  Russia's on a tightrope. It has to get its economy moving, but if it tries to do so by overdoing subsidies to business, the resulting inflation will be as destructive as anything else. Last week it took quite a jolt on that tightrope, as currency markets suddenly had big doubts and sent the ruble plummeting by 25 percent against the dollar -- its biggest single drop ever. Russia had made big strides in taming inflation, but this could well send it back to the drawing board. Boris Yeltsin started talking about conspiracies, and heads rolled -- Mr. Yeltsin fired the acting Finance Minister. But it was really just the market, and speculators, at work. The central bank managed to get the ruble to bounce back the next day, but that by no means meant the crisis was over. That was clear on Friday when the head of the central bank resigned. What Now for Mexican Labor?  So now that Nafta has been around a while, what's in store for workers at American-owned plants in Mexico? An answer may be taking shape. With Mexican factory workers lucky to get $16 a day -- about what Americans get an hour -- American unions have been trying to address that disparity. But there have been charges that companies like Honeywell and General Electric have fired union sympathizers, so the unions turned to Labor Secretary Robert Reich to ride to the rescue. But last week Mr. Reich refused to pursue the complaints. And union organizers and companies alike were watching it all very closely.

I didn't want to drive it in the rain so I had it shipped over on the back of a flatbed truck. I said what's the bill. I had my checkbook ready. He said no bill. But he did pull out four Mariners caps. He said we'll call it even if you just sign these. I have no problem doing that.\\"   If Johnson, in his start against the Indians at Jacobs Field in Cleveland Friday night, can turn around the American League Championship Series the way he did the divisional series against the Yankees exactly one week earlier, he may have a problem fending off all of his new-found friends who want to do him favors.   The series is tied at one game each, but the Indians' 5-2 victory at the Kingdome Wednesday night gave them a split of the two games here and sent them home for the middle three games, meaning they have gained an edge, at least theoretically, over the Mariners.    Johnson, however, can snatch back that edge, and he can do it with real 97-mile-an-hour fastballs and wicked sliders, rendering theory as meaningless as left-handed batters' efforts to hit Johnson's pitches.   \\"I faced him three or four years ago in spring training, and I tore a ligament in my hand,\\" said Jim Thome, the Indians' left-handed-hitting third baseman, who like the Yankees' left-handed hitting third baseman is not expected to be in the lineup against Johnson. \\"I check swung and tore a ligament and I haven't faced him since. When he was throwing, it looked like he was landing on top of me.\\"   Seldom does one player dominate the thinking about post-season series the way Johnson has the past 10 days. Because he had to pitch the Mariners' American League West playoff game against California, he could not open the series against the Yankees the next night, and his absence changed the whole complexion of that series.   But after the Yankees won the first two games, he beat them in the third game, then came back in the fifth game and pitched the final three innings in relief. Because he relieved, he was not able to open the league series against the Indians, again changing the outlook.   Had he been available for the first game, he could conceivably have made three starts, pitching the fourth game and the seventh, if necessary. Now the best he can do is come back and start the sixth or seventh, if the Mariners get the series back to Seattle.   The Mariners don't rely wholly on Johnson, but he is so dominating a pitcher and has won so many big games for them that it is only natural to focus on his presence and the expectation that comes with a Johnson start.   \\"It doesn't bother me,\\" he said, discussing the importance his teammates and Mariners fans place on his games. \\"It's a responsibility I took on when I became the pitcher I was. It's the same responsibility that a Greg Maddux or Dave Stewart or an Orel Hershiser or a Roger Clemens have. Those guys are leaders on their pitching staffs and that's the responsibility you have as a pitcher.\\"   Coincidentally, Maddux, the National League's premier pitcher, will pitch for Atlanta against Cincinnati Friday night in the third game of the National League series. Maddux couldn't start the opening game of that series because he pitched the fourth and final game against Colorado in the divisional series.   \\"The nicest comment I've gotten from another pitcher was from Greg Maddux, who said I've turned into more of a pitcher,\\" Johnson said. \\"I take a lot of pride in getting batters out now by thinking as a pitcher and not as a guy who just goes out and throws 97 miles an hour and tries to overpower everybody.\\"   Some people are never satisfied, but Johnson has improved as he has tried to become more a pitcher and less a thrower. This season, for example, as he was quick to point out, is the first time his earned run average was under 3.00 (it was a league-low 2.48).   His strikeouts-to-walks ratio also has improved. Only three seasons ago, he had 241 strikeouts and 144 walks","excerpt":"this season he struck out 294 and walked 65. Three seasons ago, he had a 12-14 record; this season it was 18-2.   \\"There was a point where my dad passed away and I was considering not even playing baseball anymore,\\" Johnson said. \\"People ask me how and why am I coming into my own now. I truly believe that I've made myself everything I wanted to be with the help of my dad. Situations I got myself into this year and the last two years I've been able to get out of because I've allowed myself to dig down a little bit deeper.\\"   There will be another pitcher in Friday night's game, Charles Nagy, who had a 16-6 record during the season. While Johnson was turning around the Mariners series against the Yankees last Friday night, Nagy was wrapping up the Indians' series against the Red Sox.   Asked how he felt about pitching against Johnson, Nagy said: \\"Randy Johnson is Randy Johnson. You can't say anything more about the guy. The Mariners want him on the mound as many times as possible.\\"   If the Indians somehow can knock him from the mound Friday night, they may not have to worry about seeing him on it anymore in this series.

After all, the channel is chockablock with cute kittens and freaky crocodiles, tail-chasing dogs and backyard bugs. And yet the impression one comes away with is not exactly that of a loving representation of our animal brethren. Animal Planet shows exhibit such a strange mixture of anthropomorphism and indignity you start to get the impression that its viewers, on some level, probably without even knowing it, dislike animals. As with Lennie and his puppy in ''Of Mice and Men,'' the fawning adulation here is tempered by less honorable urges.     All over the schedule, animals act like people. On ''The Planet's Funniest Animals'' -- each episode of which lasts, in my estimation, approximately 43 years -- parrots water ski, poodles ride in baby swings and cats give massages. (There's also a startling amount of film of cats apparently sucking people's eyes, but that's another issue, and one I intend to avoid.) Dogs seem to be especially ripe for being turned into people. For example, on ''K9 Karma,'' they do yoga. So unstoppable is the dogs-as-people juggernaut that I half-expected, when I turned on ''Miami Animal Police,'' to see pooches collaring cocaine dealers and wearing pastel blazers with pushed-up sleeves.

And some of the programming for this season is appealing: Joshua Rifkin conducts Bach's B-minor Mass, Gerard Schwarz leads Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, and performers include Hans Vonk, Vladimir Feltsman, Martha Argerich, Hermann Prey and Shura Cherkassky.   But since 1992, the festival has been operating under a shadow of Mozart-weariness. That summer, a year after its triumphant 25th anniversary, Mostly Mozart seemed a desultory affair, sweeping up crumbs left by Lincoln Center's 19-month commemoration of the bicentennial of the composer's death.

Forget San Francisco in 1967 and all those pretty flowers in your hair","excerpt":"this time the oratory fuses peace, love and psychedelic drugs with the tools of today's counterculture: \\"techno-trance\\" music (the latest soundtrack for outdoor rave parties) and the anarchic cyberpunk mentality, which characterizes much of the communication on the Internet.\\nTHE PHILOSOPHY \\"Pronoia,\\" according to the Zippies' guiding spirit, Fraser Clark, 51, is the sneaking suspicion that others are conspiring behind your back to help you. The quintessential Zippy knows no age but knows how to rave -- that is, how to dance till dawn. Zippies aspire to combine the experience and ecological wisdom of the hippie with the youthful energy and idealism of the raver. Why? To tap into an innate tribal being, a state of mind the Zippies call \\"techno-shamanism.\\" But Mr. Clark notes, \\"We're not love gurus.\\"\\nPLACE OF BIRTH The crossover between Britain's acid-house scene in the late 1980's and groups of nomadic hippies known as New Age travelers rekindled the Woodstock ideals of collective karma and frolicking in the countryside. With the opening last October of Megatripolis, a London club started by Mr. Clark -- complete with laser shows, virtual reality booths and psychedelic trance music -- the Zippies came into full being. At its opening the club turned away 3,000 people, and Mr. Clark became lord of the new techno-shamanarchy. \\"I'm just a guy,\\" he says, adding, \\"Jesus was just a guy, too, of course.\\"\\nZIPPYDOM IN THE UNITED STATES Such \\"cyberdelic\\" celebrities as Timothy Leary, the Grateful Dead lyricist John Perry Barlow and the author Ken Kesey have already expressed support for the Clark gospel. Having held rave parties in New York and San Francisco and at this year's Rainbow gathering in Wyoming, the Zippies have scheduled a weeklong \\"megarave\\" at the World Unity Festival, a musical and spiritual gathering near the Grand Canyon, beginning Aug. 22.\\nTHE NAME These Zippies bear no relation to the political faction of hippies who called themselves Zippies (Zeitgeist International Party) after breaking with Abbie Hoffman's Yippies (Youth International Party) in 1972. Nor, for that matter, with the cult cartoon character Zippy the Pinhead.\\nTHE HYPE Put it down to pre-millennial fever or just the time of year, but the Zippies believe that the summer of '94 will inspire a countercultural renaissance. It is the 25th anniversary of three events that captured the consciousness of the 60's: Woodstock, the Stonewall uprising and the arrival of the first man on the moon, all of which have prompted nostalgia and expectancy. \\"It's the 60's again,\\" Mr. Clark said. \\"It's a fractal of some kind, and each time it's more massive and eventually it breaks out of the old pattern. This has got to be the one, because we don't have time for the next fractal in another 25 years.\\"\\nMARK JOLLY THING;\\nFor Peace and Love, Try Raving Till Dawn"},{"year":"1946","title":"DETROIT, July 23 (AP)--Hal Newhouser, Detroit's stellar lefthand pitching ace, moved within one notch of his third straight season as a twenty-game winner by defeating the Senators, 6 to 1, today for his nineteenth victory of the season against three losses.

To many critics ''The White Hotel'' seemed an unusual and major work, attempting to treat the largest subjects of our time - World War II, its relation to modern consciousness as described by Freud, and the implications of Freud for the writer of fiction -through the story of a young woman patient of Freud. ''Ararat'' shares these preoccupations - in particular the Freudian conjunction of sexuality and death","excerpt":"this time they are approached through the story of Cleopatra and her lovers and in the reminiscences of a mysterious figure, encountered on a dreamlike sea voyage, who obsessively recounts his part in all of the terrible massacres of modern history. Like the earlier work, ''Ararat'' provides an abundant display of the author's astonishing virtuosity in poetry, in prose, in translating - a writer combining an impassioned European soul with the formal instincts of a spider weaving an immensely complex, elegant and sophisticated web.

MARMALADE,'' a comedy about adult behavior, produced by the Roundabout Theater Company. The twist is that said behavior is played out through the actions of two 4-year-olds, including a little girl with an imaginary friend named, yep, Mr. Marmalade. Playing that role is MICHAEL C.

By Frank McLynn. (Scarborough House, $23.95.) Henry M. Stanley, best remembered for saying \\"Dr. Livingstone, I presume?,\\" was such an eccentric character -- brave, paranoid, oversensitive and articulate -- that he is worth knowing better. The biographer Frank McLynn, in his highly readable \\"Stanley: The Making of an African Explorer,\\" presents a driven, determined man who was secretly tortured by insecurities, guilt and conflicting desires. A latent homosexual given to beating his delicate acolytes, Stanley was terrified of women, regarding them either as high-born ladies to be worshiped or as whores. Stanley always seemed to prefer adventure in the company of men to pursuing his ill-fated relationships with women. His childhood may explain his later problems: he was illegitimate (he changed his name from John Rowlands as a teen-ager) and passed from relative to relative until, as a 7-year old, he was consigned to a workhouse in Wales. But in his brief friendship with David Livingstone, who had rejected Europeand society -- and women -- to find the source of the Nile, Stanley found a kindred spirit. It is typical of Stanley's convoluted hypocrisy that he could not confess to his friend the real reason for having tracked him down in Africa: The New York Herald paid for Stanley's entire expedition in exchange for the exclusive story. Instead, he told Livingstone that the newspaper had paid for the trip as a charitable act, in order to get supplies to the stranded missionary. He set off for Africa a second time, after Livingstone's death","excerpt":"this trip took him across the entire African continent. Only by submerging himself in a life of constant danger was he able to escape his inner turmoil. But with this psychic relief came cruelty. Many men died on behalf of Stanley's determination to keep moving; some he simply abandoned when they were too sick to move. Stanley was a remarkably bold liar and bluffer; he even lied in his own diary.

CENTURY'S SON, by Robert Boswell. (Knopf, $24.) The world rolls on in recrimination and mourning in this novel of four generations, the first represented by a Russian dissident full of falsehoods, the second an unhappy couple, the third comprising an adolescent suicide and a 15-year-old mother.    A CHILD'S BOOK OF TRUE CRIME, by Chloe Hooper. (Scribner, $24.) An ambitious first novel by an Australian, in which an adulterous affair between a schoolteacher and a student's father runs parallel to an affair that ended in murder 20 years earlier. There is cause to be ill at ease, since the wronged wife in affair A has just published a book about affair B.    CHERRY: A Life of Apsley Cherry-Garrard, by Sara Wheeler. (Random House, $26.95.)

And while the meeting was going on, the price of oil fell to $25.35 a barrel, the lowest since Aug. 3, the day after the invasion began. Though it rose yesterday, to $26.42, that is still nearly $15 below the Oct. 10 peak of $41.15.    Does the market know something the rest of us do not -- that there will be no war? No one can be sure. Administration spokesmen stress the importance of destroying the power of President Saddam Hussein of Iraq to dominate the oil market and destabilize the American and world economies. As President Bush put the case two weeks after the invasion: \\"Our jobs, our way of life, our own freedom and the freedom of friendly countries around the world would all suffer if control of the world's great oil reserves fell into the hands of Saddam Hussein.\\"    Oil evidently remains a powerful cause of war, as it has been throughout modern history. \\"The fierce and sometimes violent quest for oil -- and for the riches and power it conveys -- will surely continue so long as oil holds a central place,\\" says Daniel Yergin in his new book, \\"The Prize.\\"    And Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen, Distinguished Professor of Economics Emeritus at Vanderbilt University, who was raised in Romania, writes: \\"I happened to live through three wars, all in my backyard.\\" The basic cause of \\"every one of those wars,\\" he says, \\"stemmed from the fact that at those times Romania had immense oil reserves which none of the belligerent powers wanted to letfall into the hands of its adversary.\\"    The aggressions of Iraq against Iran, then Kuwait and its threat to Saudi Arabia, and the blocking action of other nations are just the latest episodes in what Professor Georgescu-Roegen calls \\"the indissoluble binding of grand politics with mineral resources.\\"    But another problem has emerged to complicate the politics and economics of oil -- the threat to the environment and human life. This week's meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in Vienna focused, for the first time, on plans under way in Western Europe for curbing the use of oil to help reduce pollution by 1992. Calling the issue \\"a serious challenge,\\" a Saudi official said OPEC would direct its economists to study the environmental concerns of Western Europe and the effect they might have on the consumption of crude oil and refined products.   OPEC is naive to think the environmental \\"challenge\\" will come only from Western Europe. Eastern Europe, after decades of Communism, is even more polluted. Indeed, the threat of pollution from hydrocarbons is global, affecting rich and poor countries alike -- not excepting OPEC members.   Solutions to both poisonous mixtures -- oil andthe environment, and oil, money and power -- will depend on two key factors: new technology to reduce dependence on oil, and conservation. And there is no quick fix for either one.    Professor Georgescu-Roegen says that during the entire life of the human species, there have been only two viable technologies. The first he calls Prometheus I, based on the mastery of fire, the legendary gift of the Greek god Prometheus. Its fuel was wood.   But as consumption accelerated and the forests began to disappear in the latter part of the 17th century, there was a \\"crisis of wood,\\" in his words. This crisis was solved by two mortals, Thomas Savery and Thomas Newcomen, who invented the heat engine","excerpt":"this was Prometheus II, based chiefly on coal, then oil.   \\"The problem now,\\" says Professor Georgescu-Roegen, \\"is whether and when a Prometheus III will come to get us out of the present muddle.\\" No one knows for sure. Meanwhile, the best strategy is to gain as much lead time as possible, and the way to do that is through conservation -- \\"a conservation compatible with an acceptable survival of all humanity, without ignoring the needed development of those nations that are now in economic and social distress.\\"    Conservation, whether used to lessen dependency on oil from a highly troubled and explosive region or to combat the threat to the environment, cannot be the job of one nation or a few but must be the job of virtually all nations working together.    Yet a nation seeking to protect its own economy and security can still benefit greatly from conservation on its own. A dramatic example is Japan, completely dependent on imported oil, which after the oil shocks of the 1970's drastically cut its use of energy while maintaining the highest rate of economic growth in the world. Japan's per capita energy consumption is now just two-fifths that of the United States.    A combination of high energy taxes on consumers and strong financial incentives to industry to develop and use energy-efficient equipment made the difference.

Osaki, now impoverished and nearly 70, invites the historian to her hovel, where the younger woman begins behaving like Little Miss Muffet, cringing prettily at the worms in the bath water.The historian just barely manages to stifle her revulsion until the old lady decides to tell her story, which turns out not to have been worth waiting for. Sample pearl: \\"Don't fall in love, no matter what. When you're in love, you're blind.\\"Osaki's tale, told in flashback, repeatedly illustrates what loathsome brutes men are, and the historian, in a series of senseless cuts to the present, keeps on nodding sympathetically. Along the way, there is also some mention of Japanese imperialism, and of the homeland's hypocrisy in shunning the karayuki-san when they tried to return from the colonies. But most of the film, which is artlessly shot and acted in an exaggerated, melodramatic style, concentrates on proving that there really is a fate worse than death.Yoko Takahashi and Kinuyo Tanaka, two lovely actresses who play Osaki as a young girl and an old woman, have some impressive moments, on those few occasions when Kei Kumai's direction allows for any subtlety. As the historian, Komaki Kurihara wears an impenetrably pasty smile and does more harm than good. Osaki's story might have retained some of its integrity had it not been set in flashback","excerpt":"this way, too many present-day ironies are allowed to interrupt it, trivialize it and blunt its power.

So it seems appropriate that the two should meet in the Spiegeltent. Among the many offerings in the maiden New York season of this small, 1920's vintage circus tent -- complete with velvet curtains, mirrors and a haze of (fake) smoke -- is a six-part series presented by the Brooklyn new-music cooperative Darmstadt, named for a classic German center of contemporary music. Darmstadt's musical and experimental tastes are often crudely classified as ''downtown'' (the group has a monthly series at Galapagos Art Space in Williamsburg, Brooklyn), but the group it is presenting at Spiegeltent this week defies such labels. That group, the International Contemporary Ensemble, above, made its Lincoln Center debut last week in the Mostly Mozart Festival (''uptown'')","excerpt":"this week at Spiegeltent (''downtown'') it casts its die across a broad spectrum of music that qualifies as contemporary, from the landmark works of John Cage to the complex intellectual edifices of Iannis Xenakis, the strong gestures of the Dutch composer Louis Andriessen to the cutting-edge experiments of Du Yun, one of the ensemble's founders, to whom the terms ''young composer'' and ''pianist'' hardly do justice. Awarded, celebrated, and even recorded on two CD's due out this season on Bridge Records and Naxos, the International Contemporary Ensemble is part of a trend of multidisciplinary ensembles with genre-defying approaches that appeal to smart, adventurous young audiences. In September the ensemble shows its true colors with a weeklong festival in Chicago consisting of concerts by the ensemble and the other bands and groups to which its 30-odd versatile members belong, performing various kinds of music.

We're in the gulf because the world must not and cannot reward aggression. And we're there because our vital interests are at stake. And we're in the gulf because of the brutality of Saddam Hussein.    We're dealing with a dangerous dictator all too willing to use force, who has weapons of mass destruction and is seeking new ones and who desires to control one of the world's key resources -- all at a time in history when the rules of the post-cold-war world are being written.   Objectives of U.S.     Our objectives remain what they were since the outset. We seek Iraq's immediate and unconditional withdrawal from Kuwait. We seek the restoration of Kuwait's legitimate Government. We seek the release of all hostages and the free functioning of all embassies. And we seek the stability and security of this critical region of the world.    We are not alone in these goals and objectives. The United Nations, invigorated with a new sense of purpose, is in full agreement. The United Nations Security Council has endorsed 12 resolutions to condemn Iraq's unprovoked invasion and occupation of Kuwait, implement tough economic sanctions to stop all trade in and out of Iraq and authorize the use of force to compel Saddam to comply.    Saddam Hussein has tried every way he knows how to make this a fight between Iraq and the United States, and clearly he has failed.    Forces of 26 other nations are standing shoulder-to-shoulder with our troops in the gulf. The fact is that it is not the United States against Iraq. It is Iraq against the world. And there's never been a clearer demonstration of a world united against appeasement and aggression.    Yesterday's United Nations Security Council resolution was historic. Once again the Security Council has enhanced the legitimate peacekeeping function of the United Nations. Until yesterday, Saddam may not have understood what he's up against in terms of world opinion. And I'm hopeful that now he will realize that he must leave Kuwait immediately.    I'm continually asked how effective are the U.N. sanctions -- those put into effect on Aug. 6. And I don't know the answer to that question. Clearly the sanctions are having some effect. But I can't tell you that the sanctions alone will get the job done. And thus I welcome yesterday's United Nations action.    The fledgling democracies in Eastern Europe are being severely damaged by the economic effects of Saddam's actions. The developing countries of Africa and in our hemisphere are being victimized by this dictator's rape of his neighbor Kuwait.   Fragile Economies in Trouble     Those who feel that there is no downside to waiting months and months must consider the devastating damage being done every day to the fragile economies of those countries that can afford it the least.    As chairman Alan Greenspan  [ of the Federal Reserve Board ]  testified just the other day, the increase in oil prices resulting directly from Saddam's invasion is hurting our country too. And our economy, as I said the other day, is at best in a serious slowdown, and if uncertainty remains in the energy markets, the slowdown will get worse.    I've spelled out once again our reasons for sending troops to the gulf. Let me tell you the things that concern me most:   First, I put the immorality of the invasion of Kuwait itself. No nation should rape, pillage and brutalize its neighbor. No nation should be able to wipe a member state of the United Nations and the Arab League off the face of the earth.    And I'm deeply concerned about all the hostages, innocent people held against their will in direct contravention of international law. And then there's this cynical and brutal policy of forcing people to beg for their release, parceling out human lives to families and traveling emissaries like so much chattel.    And I'm deeply concerned about our own Embassy in Kuwait. The flag is still flying there. A handful of beleaguered Americans remain inside the Embassy unable to come and go. This treatment of our Embassy violates every civilized principle of diplomacy. And it demeans our people. It demeans our country. And I am determined that this Embassy, as called for under Security Council Resolution 674, be fully replenished and our people free to come home. What kind of precedent will these actions set for the future if Saddam's violation of international law goes unchallenged?    I'm also deeply concerned about the future of Kuwait itself. The tales of rape and assassination, of cold-blooded murder and rampant looting, are almost beyond belief. The whole civilized world must unite and say this kind of treatmet of people must end and those who violated the Kuwaiti people must be brought to justice.  Potential Nuclear Threat     I'm deeply concerned about Saddam's efforts to acquire nuclear weapons. Imagine his ability to blackmail his neighbors should he possess a nuclear device. We've seen him use chemical weapons on his own people. We've seen him take his own country -- one that should be wealthy and prosperous -- and turn it into a poor country, all because of insatiable appetite for military equipment and conquest.    I've been asked why I ordered more troops to the gulf. I remain hopeful that we can achieve a peaceful solution to this crisis, but if force is required, we and the other 26 countries who have troops in the area will have enough power to get the job done.   In our country, I know that there are fears about another Vietnam. Let me assure you: should military action be required, this will not be another Vietnam","excerpt":"this will not be a protracted, drawn-out war. The forces arrayed are different, the opposition is different, the resupply of Saddam's military would be very different, the countries united against him in the United Nations are different, the topography of Kuwait is different and the motivation of our all-volunteer force is superb.    I want peace. I want peace, not war. But if there must be war, we will not permit our troops to have their hands tied behind their backs, and I pledge to you there will not be any murky ending. If one American soldier has to go into battle, that soldier will have enough force behind him to win, and then get out as soon as possible, as soon as the U.N. objectives have been achieved.   I will never, ever agree to a halfway effort. Let me repeat: we have no argument with the people of Iraq. Indeed, we've only friendship for the people there. And further, I repeat that we have no desire to keep one single American soldier in the gulf a single day longer than is necessary to achieve the objectives set out above.    No one wants to see a peaceful solution to this crisis more than I do, and at the same time, no one is more determined than I am to see Saddam's aggression reversed.  'Time Is Running Out'     And lastly, people now caution patience. The United States and the entire world have been patient. I will continue to be patient. But yesterday's U.N. resolution, the 13th by the Security Council, properly says to Saddam Hussein: time is running out. You must leave Kuwait, and we've given you time to do just exactly that.   Many people have talked directly to Saddam Hussein, and to his Foreign Minister, Tariq Aziz. All have been frustrated by Iraq's ironclad insistence that it will not leave Kuwait. However, to go the extra mile for peace, I will issue an invitation to Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz to come to Washington, at a mutually convenient time during the latter part of the week of Dec. 10, to meet with me. And I'll invite ambassadors of several of our coalition partners in the gulf to join me at that meeting.   In addition, I'm asking Secretary Jim Baker to go to Baghdad to see Saddam Hussein, and I will suggest to Iraq's President that he receive the Secretary of State at a mutually convenient time between Dec. 15 and Jan. 15 of next year. Within the mandate -- within the mandate of the United Nations resolutions -- I will be prepared, and so will Secretary Baker, to discuss all aspects of the gulf crisis.   However, to be very clear about these efforts to exhaust all means for achieving a political and diplomatic solution, I am not suggesting discussions that will result in anything less than Iraq's complete withdrawal from Kuwait, restoration of Kuwait's legitimate Government and freedom for all hostages.    Thank you very much, and I will be glad to respond to a few questions.                    QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS       A Deadline for War?     Q. Mr. President, now that you have the clear-cut U.N. resolution on use of force, doesn't that force you into a position -- if these talks between the Secretary of State break down, doesn't this force you into the position of having to use force on Jan. 15 if Saddam Hussein hasn't left, and if not, won't we be seen as the one that blinked first?    A. No, the date was not a date at which point force had to be used.    Q. If I could just follow up with another question. Are you going to ask Congress for approval of this resolution? Would you like to see Congress pass the same kind of resolution as the U.N.?   A. I'd love to see Congress pass a resolution enthusiastically endorsing what the United Nations has done, yes. We're in consultation on that and I have no plans to call a special session. I'm not opposed to it, but we're involved in consultations right now. I've talked to several members of Congress, I've talked to leaders in the House, I've talked to several on the Republican side and Democratic side in the Senate. And I want to be sure that these consultations are complete.   Some feel a lame-duck session is not good, that the new members should have a right to have a say. Others feel that we ought to move right now. The Congress, as you know, in their adjournment resolution, had a provision in there that they could come back and take this up. They are a coequal branch of government, they can do that if they want to. But I -- we will continue our consultations. . . .   Price of Victory    Q. Mr. President, you say you're confident that American troops will prevail against Saddam if called upon.    A. Oh, absolutely.   Q. At what price? I mean --   A. Well, I can't give you that. I can't give you that, any figures, of course. But I can say that the movement of this additional force safeguards the lives of every American and every one of our allies in the gulf.    Q. Mr. President, in recent days, senior members of the Administration have emphatically rejected the idea of any special emissaries or diplomatic envoys to or from Iraq to discuss this, on your part. What changed your mind, sir?   A. The United Nations resolution, I think, has a good chance of making Saddam Hussein understand what it is he's up against. I have not felt that he got the message. I hope this will do it. But I am convinced that these two direct meetings that I've discussed here will guarantee to all the people of the world -- certainly to the American people -- that Saddam Hussein not misunderstand, not misinterpret.  .  .  .     Q. You indicate that this date is not actually a deadline for the use of force, merely a date after which force would be permissible. How do you avoid the impression, should that day come and go without military action, that the U.S.-led coalition has in fact blinked?   A. Well, we've got to look at events at the time. But I don't think there will ever be a perception that the United States is going to blink in this situation. That's why I had some of the words in this statement that I had. Yes?  Quest for Mideast Stability    Q. Mr. President, you've just spoken about the weapons of mass destruction and nuclear weapons, and also that one of your goals is to try to reach stability in the region. Can you reach stability in the region with Saddam Hussein in power?   A. I think most countries, members of the United Nations, feel that there have to be some safeguards put into effect in terms of guaranteeing the security and stability of the gulf. And so I would think that the status quo ante will not be enough, and I think there will be -- there are sanctions in place now, and I think it would be very proper to discuss what those safeguards should be after there has been a total compliance with the United Nations resolutions.  .  .  .     Q. Mr. President, I want to ask if your comments about the Kuwaiti Embassy -- whether it's fair to conclude, based on those, that you will neither close the Embassy nor permit those Americans to be starved out?    A. I will not say exactly what I will do or exactly what I won't do. There is a very interesting report that we got in this morning saying that some Iraqis showed up at the Kuwaiti Embassy -- our Embassy in Kuwait -- and had delivered fruit, vegetables and a case of Iraqi cigarettes to Embassy Kuwait. And apparently there's going to be another delivery tomorrow, including soda pop. And they asked what medical supplies were required. And it doesn't say that. And the Embassy will apparently provide a list tomorrow. And the electricity is still cut off. So this is kind of an interesting little development. But I -- somebody said to me: Well, hy, what about if there's some provocation? They asked me in the leadership meeting. I said consider me provoked when it comes to the United States Embassy. Consider me provoked when I see Americans without proper food and medical equipment.    Q. May I follow up? Do you take it from that communique that you received there that the Iraqis have the message and want to eliminate that as a potential tripwire?    A. I don't know. It's too early -- it's the best question, right on target, one that we were discussing inside. And I -- let's try to be optimistic and say this is -- this could be a positive sign. But it's so far short of compliance with international law that I can't be rejoicing. But it is a very interesting development. . . .   Criticism in Congress    Q. You've been getting some pretty negative comments up on the Hill at these hearings that have been held this week. Now this morning you said this would not be a long, protracted, Vietnam-type war. However, General Odom, the former head of the N.S.A., testified just this morning at the Senate Armed Services that in fact you have to be there for decades. Now presumably he means even after military combat. We'd have to have people in place there as part of a peacekeeping force. Do you see our commitment there extend that far?    A. No I don't.    Q. May I ask something else? Al Gore, yesterday, takes issue with your comments and the comments of some of your aides, such as Brent Scowcroft, about Saddam being able to churn out a nuclear weapon in a matter of months. Gore, who's had some private briefings, apparently, from some of your people, indicates that your Administration statements are misleading.    A. I disagree with the Senator. And if he wants to gamble on the future about the construction of atomic weapons by Saddam Hussein, I don't. And I know what the intelligence says. Every bit of it. And I can't share it, obviously, because we don't comment on intelligence matters. But I am concerned. . . .   Dependability of Allies    Q. Of those 26 nations that you list in the area, how many of those are equally committed to offensive action other than just defensive action?   A. I can't give you the answer to that, because I don't really know. But I'd expect that there is enthusiasm in all quarters of those countries for the U.N. action that was taken yesterday.    Q. With all respect, shouldn't you know how many would follow your troops into battle?    A. I know that what I said is true about the -- if we have to go into battle, and I'm satisfied I know enough about that. I went over in detail -- as you might well imagine a President should, because I have the responsibility as commander in chief -- what might happen if we have to use force. I repeat, I hope we'll never have to have one single shot fired in anger. Yes?   Q. Iraq has been constantly calling for dialogue. Aren't you concerned that those two missions, Tariq Aziz and James Baker, will lead Saddam Hussein to claim that the U.S. is showing signs of weakness?  .  .  .     A. No, I'm not. I'm concerned some might say this is an ultimatum, in which -- all it is is an effort to make sure that he understands the commitment of the United States, that he understands that anything that is done must be done inside the confines of the United Nations resolutions that have been passed, that there will be no contingency, there can be no face-saving. This is not what this is about. This is to be sure that he understands how strongly the President of the United States feels about implementing to a T, without concession, the United Nations position.    And some have told me that he's not getting the message of how determined we are. And I can't think of any better way to do it, at this juncture, in the wake of the U.N. resolution, than this face-to-face meeting. I'm not sure he'll agree to it. . . .    Q. The Soviet Union did indeed vote on our side as far as the resolution, allowing force if it's necessary. Are we going to offer the Soviet Union any compromise on export credits? As you know, there's some concern that they think there's a de facto grain embargo going on because we won't offer export credits in their very needy time.   A. The matters are totally separate and unrelated, but I am concerned about this. And I've talked about, with Mr. Gorbachev, of a willingness to entertain proposals for food -- particularly if the reports prove to be accurate in terms of the severe winter and the hardship that this will inflict on the Soviet people.   Conference on Mideast    Q. Mr. President, you -- Arab experts suggest that Saddam Hussein has hinted in his remarks that he would like to have some sort of deal, but he wouldn't necessarily hold to his demands. Now you're saying you're willing to meet with him. Are you willing to offer him anything in these meetings in return for a pullout, such as a conference on the Middle East?   A. No. Those two items are totally separate. We've made that very very clear. And what I have said is that this will be -- these discussions will be done within the U.N. mandate. . . .    Q. Mr. President, you mentioned the damage that higher oil prices are doing to the world economy. Should Saudi Arabia and other producers share more of their windfall?    A. I think they're doing a pretty good job in underwriting the costs to various countries and helping third-party countries that are -- that have been hurt by all of this. But I think everybody should go the extra mile to help others. . . .   Q. . . . Should Saudi Arabia have a military draft?    A. That's for the Saudi Arabians to decide. I don't think the United States needs one, incidentally. . . .   Risking American Lives    Q. Mr. President, if you ultimately feel that you have to ask Americans to support the use of force, what that, of course, means is that you have to ask some parents to give up the lives of their children.    A. I know it.    Q. And what I was wondering was, we all know how important your children are to you. Do you feel that this issue is important enough to you that you could conceive of giving up one of their lives for it?    A. You know, Maureen, you've put your -- you put your finger on a very difficult question. People say to me: How many lives? How many lives can you expend? Each one's precious. And I don't want to reminisce, but I've been there. I know what it's like to have fallen comrades and see young kids die in battle. And it's only the President that should be asked to make the decision. Is it worth it? How many lives is it worth? Is it worth it to commit one life -- put one life in harm's way -- to achieve these objectives? And that's why I want to get a peaceful resolution to this question. You ought to read my mail. It is so heart-moving. Supportive and yet: \\"Please bring my kid home. Please bring my husband home.\\" And it's a tough question. But a President has to make the right decision. And these are worldwide principles of moral importance. And I will do my level best to bring those kids home without one single shot fired in anger. And if a shot is fired in anger, I want to guarantee each person that their kid, whose life is in harm's way, will have the maximum support, will have the best chance to come home alive and will be backed up to the hilt. And that's why -- it's because of that question that weighs on my mind I added that language this morning about how this will not be a Vietnam. They can criticize me for moving force, and if we got one kid that's apt to be in harm's way, I want him backed up to the hilt by American firepower and others as well. And that's why I'm working as hard as I am, not only to hold this coalition together but to strengthen it. . . . And if force has to be used, the best way to safeguard lives is to see that you got the best and you're willing to use it. . . .

Profit does not seem to be the point at Romeo Gigli 's new Manhattan store, which opened a week ago. With its Venetian-glass chandeliers, mosaics, Fornasetti screens, outdoor garden and gallery, the store is definitely unusual. But is it a business?   Takashimaya , a Japanese retail company that financed the Gigli boutique in Paris, bought the building, at 21 East 69th Street. The first three floors, where the men's and women's clothing are sold, are a joint venture of Takashimaya and Mr. Gigli. Mr. Gigli (whose name is pronounced ZHEE-lee) leases the fourth floor, which is a gallery, and the fifth, which is used for offices. Plans call for sales of $1.8 million in the first year. The first week, the store took in $20,000, which is off the pace, but boutiques often do better as time goes by.    The least expensive item is a pair of socks, for $35. Some of the coats, almost ecclesiastical in their embroidered finery, cost more than $30,000.   \\"In our business, image is No. 1,\\" said Ellen Carey, who is, appropriately, the image director of the company in New York. \\"We really want to show the most creative pieces, even if they don't sell.\\"   But more reasonable merchandise is on its way. Mr. Gigli's resort collection, which begins arriving this week, includes cotton-Lycra tops, skirts and pants in the $300 to $550 range. Next year there will be a lower-priced collection called G. Gigli, for both men and women. This more casual sportswear line is being created primarily for the American market.   \\"It will have all of his best shapes,\\" Ms. Carey said, \\"all the pieces that everyone else has been knocking off.\\"   The reason Mr. Gigli is doing a secondary line, apparently, is that everybody else seemed to be doing one. Samples of the Time    A sign of the current state of fashion retailing: the rise in sample sales. Historically, these allowed companies to clear out showroom samples and undelivered or mismatched shipments.   But Seventh Avenue manufacturers are now using showroom sales as a way of offsetting poor retail performance, said Elysa Lazar, the president of The S & B Report, a consumer guide to unadvertised showroom and sample sales.   Ms. Lazar said there had been 50 percent more sample sales this fall than in the same period last year. The November 1989 issue of The S & B Report listed 100 companies holding such sales","excerpt":"this year it has 150.   The depth and variety of merchandise at recent sample sales also suggest hard times. Instead of a few sizes and styles, there is a lot of everything, some below wholesale, compared with straight wholesale last year. Toning It Down    Charivari , the Manhattan-based retailer, is weathering the downward turn by expanding wholesale operations. The company recently introduced a more casual version of its private-label collection Sans Tambours ni Trompettes. (The name is French for \\"without fanfare,\\" the opposite of Charivari, \\"din.\\")   The new line, STNT for short, is mostly men's wear costing $50 to $200. The line has been ordered by such stores as Bloomingdale's, Saks Fifth Avenue and I. Magnin. By the Numbers: Color    Reinforcing the folk wisdom that color is the best antidote to gray economic times, designers have been choosing brighter hues, according to Pantone Inc., whose swatch cards are used by clothing and textile manufacturers.   Black, which was No. 1 in 1989, has slid to 24th in Pantone's sales. That means yellow-green, or chartreuse, so popular in recent seasons, has also faded out of favor.

Jogged by the recent entry into the trans-Atlantic vacation market of People Express, which offers $149 one-way flights to London, many airlines, United States and foreign, are posting cheaper fares for summer, some competitive with People Express. And since all of us will not be able to squeeze into that leased Boeing 747 that People Express is shuttling back and forth across the ocean (not yet anyway, because its flights are almost solidly booked for the summer), it pays to investigate thoroughly the bargain fares available elsewhere.   The good news is that the airlines - in particular the American trans-Atlantic Big Two, Pan American World Airways and Trans World Airlines - have cut some fares sharply from last summer's levels.

Besides the time missed from work or home, the fear associated with breast cancer can also create mental agony.   Dr. T. S. Ravikumar, the co-director of the Yale Comprehensive Breast Care Center in New Haven, said that by coordinating a team of specialists under one roof, he and his staff aim to offer women more expedient attention. Staffed with surgeons, radiologists, pathologists and social workers, the center opened last month and is the first of its kind in the state. In addition to evaluating and treating a spectrum of breast conditions from adolescent breast diseases to advanced breast cancer, the center also offers consulting services for high-risk patients, second opinions, and the review of test results.     Dr. Ravikumar, an oncologist, received his medical degree from Madras Medical College in India. He has served on the faculty of the Harvard Medical School, the Dana Farber Cancer Institute and New England Deaconess Hospital in Boston. Appointed associate professor of surgery at the Yale University Medical School earlier this year, Dr. Ravikumar specializes in breast and gastrointestinal malignancies.    In an interview at Yale, he discussed services offered by the new center as well as current studies in breast cancer. Here are some excerpts from the conversation:      Q. What is the biggest advantage for patients who use the Yale center?     A. The center is consumer-friendly in that the patient will see the physician and surgeon and radiologist all in one day. If a woman needs to have mammograms evaluated or a second opinion, she would stay in one consultation room, and each one of the physicians would go in separately to talk with her. A final interpretation is done by the end of the day when all of the physicians meet to make a consensus opinion.   Depending upon the surgeon's evaluation, if a woman comes in who has a lump, she could opt to have a needle biopsy at the bedside that day, or else the biopsy could be done in the operating room under some sedation. The pathologist would be available to read any slides for women who want to have an opinion immediately    If a needle biopsy is performed, sometimes you can get results immediately by what we call a frozen section. But a frozen section is not used all the time, because it's not 100 percent accurate. We use it as an estimate. We always have to wait for the final diagnosis, which takes a day or two before we make a major decision.     Q. How many women will be diagnosed with breast cancer this year, and of those, how many will be classified as having early breast cancer?     A. Last year, 143,000 women were diagnosed with breast cancer","excerpt":"this year it's almost 150,000. To give you a rough estimate, 60,000 to 65,000 will be stage-one breast cancer, another 60,000 to 65,000 will be stage two, which are all early breast cancers. That leaves 20,000 women, 10,000 of whom will have advanced breast cancer, meaning it's already spread. Another 10,000 will have intraductal cancers, which show up on a mammogram in the form of microcalcifications or shadows in the milk ducts.    The most common forms of breast cancers originate in the duct and spread to the duct linings, then to other parts of the body. Intraductal carcinoma, we think, is pre-invasive cancer and virtually 100 percent curable. We would like to increase our detection of these carcinomas so that we can diagnose the cancer at a very early stage.      Q. What's the cure rate for other early breast cancers?     A. Most of the cancers detected at less than one and a half centimeters are 95 percent curable, while a lump of four centimeters is less than 50 percent curable. So there is a big lead time for a person who is doing breast exams regularly and having mammograms and a person who is doing neither and suddenly feels a big lump one day.     Q. There     A. There is some uniformity of opinion. I think all physicians would agree that women should have one once a year after age 50. All of us would also agree that women should at least have a baseline between age 35 and 40. The controversy lies between the ages of 40 and 50. If a woman between 40 and 50 has had a normal baseline and does not have any high-risk factors of breast cancer, there's no data that suggests that she should have one every year. But various societies recommend differently. There's a loose guideline that says women between those ages should have it every two or three years.     Q. Though mammograms give off a minimal amount of radiation, there's concern that over years the accumulation of radiation could induce cancer. What is your response?     A. That issue has been addressed in a few studies that showed that women who have infrequent mammograms between the ages of 40 to 50 and once a year after 50 have a minuscule chance of getting breast cancer from mammograms.    It's a statistically insignificant increase over the population at large. And even if it is induced by radiation from the mammography it can be detected early and could be treated as an early breast cancer.     Q. Another controversy is the breast biopsy rate. Some medical experts argue that it is way too high. Do you agree?      A. It's true that only 15 to 25 percent of breast biopsies are either precancerous or cancerous, and the vast majority are benign. We do have to improve our discrimination methods. But we also need to determine a percentage rate we'll be comfortable with, and that's very difficult to do. If we say, let's do the biopsy for such and such calcification only, or for a lump mass that has such and such characteristics only, then we may go up on the percentage of positive biopsies. But, by the same token, there may be an occasional cancer missed. So an ideal biopsy rate is hard to nail down.     Q. Besides mammograms, what other measures should women take?      A. There have been studies linking diet to breast cancer, but I don't think that's been conclusively shown. Statistically obese women who have a high-cholesterol diet have a higher risk of getting breast cancer, but overall, diet seems to be a minor factor. Other things a woman can control is the age of her first child and her synthetic hormone intake.   Studies have shown that women over the age of 30 who take birth-control pills in low doses for short periods of time probably don't have any higher risk of developing cancer. But if taken in high doses for more than 5 or 10 years, it may predispose women to developing breast cancer. Hormonal-replacement therapy for post-menapausal women remains a very controversial issue. However, given estrogen and progesterone cyclically, studies have shown that it does not increase the risk of developing breast cancer. Hormonal levels have only a partial influence in the development of the disease.     Q. What are the most common benign breast conditions?     A. Fibrocystic conditions, the response of the breast tissue to hormonal changes, which occurs mainly in premenopausal women, are very common. It does not mean that a patient has a predisposition to breast cancer. However, a small group of women with fibrocystic disease may develop into a high-risk category for breast cancer. Others include fibroadenomas, which are solitary, moveable lumps. They are usually small, but if they grow to a large size, then they may become premalignant or malignant. By and large, all fibroadenomas are benign.     Q. What kinds of psychological support does the center offer?     A. We have a social worker on staff who will not only offer comfort to women who have been diagnosed with cancer but can also let them know of cancer support groups for patients and families. For women who will be getting radiation or chemotherapy, we have a Look Good, Feel Good program, sponsored by the National Cancer Society and various cosmetology associations around the country. Basically, it helps women explore how to care for their skin and hair while going through radiation or chemotherapy. Plastic and reconstructive surgery options for women who decide to have a mastectomy can also be discussed.      Q. What do you feel is the most important research being done?     A. Since there has been a hereditary link to breast cancer, studies are now being done on genetic analysis. It's possible that in the next decade or so, women who have a family history of breast cancer can come in for a genetic screening by way of a blood test or a normal-tissue biopsy, which could tell us if she is predisposed to breast cancer. That seems to be among the most promising research. New Yale Program Treats Breast Cancer"},{"year":"1996","title":"Last year, it was Windows 95 for BILL GATES","excerpt":"this year it's Baby 96.
