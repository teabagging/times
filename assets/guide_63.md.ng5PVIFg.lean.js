The trumpeter Wynton Marsalis's achievements in handling those varied demands have brought him considerable success. Judging from its title, one would expect his book, SWEET SWING BLUES ON THE ROAD (Norton, $29.95), to document how he had managed this mix. At its most engaging, it does just that, offering brief vignettes of the days and nights of a touring band: the humor, the petty annoyances and the satisfaction of making music for (mostly) appreciative audiences. There is also a moving chapterlong homage to respected elder jazzmen. Frank Stewart's elegant photographs offer a nice visual counterpoint to the text. Unfortunately, at some point in his career, Mr. Marsalis took on or had thrust upon him the mantle of Spokesman for the Art of Jazz, a mantle that he now wears quite happily. As a result, too much of the book is taken up with transcripts of classroom sessions in which he restates his views on music and culture and his distaste for rap, rock and MTV. Whether or not one agrees with his assessment of popular culture, he has stated these views forcefully in other, more appropriate venues. Those who agree with Mr. Marsalis will undoubtedly be happy to have their opinions affirmed yet again, but readers looking for a more complete picture of road life will be disappointed.\\nGEORGE ROBINSON IN SHORT: NONFICTION","excerpt":"Travels With Wynton"},{"year":"1997","title":"Profile of of Gooch Ware Travelstead, real estate developer described by both his few remaining friends and his many enemies as 'visionary'","excerpt":"Travelstead, who persuaded First Boston Corp to place him at helm of its worldwide real estate operation in boom years of 1980's and eventually lend him at least $37 million to share in its deals, is known for such projects as the Canary Wharf project in London's docklands; as Travelstead's projects foundered, his relationships with his partners, friends and investors turned from admiration to recriminations and tangled lawsuits on three continents; legal problems facing Travelstead discussed; his photo and photos of some of his projects (L) The Collapse of a Master Builder; 80's 'Visionary' in Legal Battles on 3 Continents"},{"year":"1974","title":"Mr. and Mrs. Walther Bockhorn of Ltibeck&#8208","excerpt":"Travemilnde, West Germany, have announced the engagement of their daughter, Miss Ruth Bockhorn, to Thomas Joseph Reckford of Washington, a staff member of the Commission on the Organization of the Government for the Conduct of Foreign Policy.
