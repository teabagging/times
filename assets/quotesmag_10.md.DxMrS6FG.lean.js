Set in the grim industrial Lancashire town of its title and in the trenches of the Western Front, this drama is yet another reminder that the pride of English manhood died needlessly in a catastrophic binge of jingoistic hubris.

There is a genuine laugh or two in the current film, sandwiched between reels of stale wheezes. The assumption throughout is that the spectacle of two unattractive women of advanced years fighting about matters of a personal nature constitutes a good basis for comedy. It is only fair to report that the laughter which greeted \\"Reducing\\" yesterday was prolonged and loud.Certainly an examination of the story fails to reveal any humorous possibilities. An untutored woman who has come into money through the management of a beauty parlor brings her poor sister and her family from the country to live with her. Both women have daughters, the city girl being affianced to a wealthy young man. The country cousin, dissatisfied with the prospect of settling down with a postoffice clerk, succums to the wealthy young man's wiles.Miss Dressler appears as the dowdy country sister and Miss Moran is the beauty specialist. Most of the heavy-handed humor arises out of the latter's habit of continually reminding the former of the money she has lent her. Toward the close of the film the director drops the rowdy comedy. In these latter scenes, thanks to Miss Dressler, there are several really moving moments, but they are meaningless because of the predominating hilarious mood of the film.In the beauty parlor sequences Miss Dressler is called on to shove Miss Moran into a mud bath, break a valuable plate glass window, switch various electric currents on at the wrong time and unwittingly endanger the lives of several fat women. Anita Page and Sally Eilers are, respectively, the country and city sisters","excerpt":"William Collier Jr. is the wealthy young suitor.

SLAPSTICK AT THE CAPITOL.; Marie Dressler and Polly Moran Draw Loud Laughter In \\"Reducing.\\""},{"year":"1923","title":"Apaches who leer and loot and fight, a King incognito who loves a pure girl miraculously undefiled by contact with the underworld, a noble young thief who dies to raise his beloved to the arms of her Prince—of such is the crowded film at the Cameo this week. It is called \\"Secrets of Paris,\\" and acknowledges the parentage of Eugene Sue's well-known work, \\"Mysteries of Paris,\\" the change of title indicating that what mystery there was in the original has been removed by time or the cinema's detailed literalness. The picture's \\"secrets,\\" however, are, apparently, those of the Paris underworld, which now are violently exposed for the horror and satisfaction of American movie fans and their less fanatic mothers and fathers.But it is not as an exposure of anything that ever existed, nor as an account of anything that ever could happen that the film at the Cameo will impress itself, if at all. It will seem rather a wild and incredible melodrama that makes up in intermitent intensity what it lacks in continuity and persuasiveness. Dorothy Farn???m, who prepared the adaptation, seems to have atempted to put too much of the printed story into the film. Instead of selecting from the novel a definite line of action that could be translated into cohesive moving pictures, she has spread the story in too great detail in some places and barely sketched it in others, with the result that the spectator does not follow a smooth and continuous narrative, but, instead, is alternately confused and excited by a jumping succession of scenes. And when the story does become clear it becomes at the same time so obvious and so palpably impossible that the interest in it stops at its starting point.But the exciting scenes, in themselves, hold the attention. For one thing, they are intensified by a number of stirring, if overdrawn, impersonations. Rose Coghlan, as The Owl, an old hag of the underworld","excerpt":"William Collier Jr., as the young thief who loves the uncontaminated Mayflower; Gladys Hulette, whose love goes above him; Lew Cody, as the Prince to whom she rises; Dolores Cassinelli, as a dancing-girl, and Montagu Love, as the chief of the Apaches—these are all people stereotyped as to character, but so surely and so strongly marked by the manner and appearance they give themselves that they possess a compelling life of their own for their moment on the screen. And the scenes in which they appear, the settings, the violent action of their dancing and drinking and fighting, are a part of their melodramatic existence.So the report is that Kenneth Webb, the director, and his associates have made quite a number of theatrically effective scenes for \\"Secrets of Paris,\\" but have not told a coherent, convincing story with them.Also at the Cameo, in contrast with the violence of the photoplay, is \\"Arcadian Meadows,\\" a scenic by W. A. Van Scoy, which contains some genuinely beautiful camera paintings and also several pictures so obscured by blurred lines and masses that they tax the eyes of the spectator who unconsciously tries to make them out. Soft-focus effects can induce eye-strain as well as visual delight.Borrowing its initial situation from \\"The Great Divide,\\" in which, it will be remembered, the hero gambles for the girl, \\"One Week of Love,\\" the photoplay at the Capitol this week, pursues the course of out-and-out melodrama, to a stagy conclusion which, though thrilling in itself as a spectacle, is patently put on for the sake of its thrill without regard to the logic and aim of the story. This interloping incident is a train wreck. Half of a high trestle has been washed away by a cloudburst and an engine pulling several cars tumbles over the open end of the structure into the raging waters below. Is well done photographically and simply as a scene is a thriller.But the heroine is on the train. She is leaving the hero into whose rough life in Mexico she has dived in a disabled airplane. She has been forced to live in his hut for eight days, during which she has hated him so vehemently that you know her hate will turn into love. When she leaves him, therefore, you are sure that she will come back, and the story would have achieved its highest effectiveness if her return had been quiet and voluntary after renewed contact with her former world. To have her tumbled into the water in a train wreck and then rescued, of course, by the handy hero, is to sacrifice the climax of hte story for the sake of a sensational scene.It's about as well that this was done, however, because the force of the story is pretty generally dissipated along its course by obvious melodrama and childishly simple symbolism. There's really little to the thing except pictorial thrills, the wreck of the airplane early in the picture vieing with the train wreck later for first honors.In the cave-man part of the renegade American who captures the heroine and wins her love by treating her rough. Conway Tearle does the best work of the cast. Hallam Cooley is easy in the rôle of the heroine's more civilized admirer, and Elaine Hammerstein looks well as the girl, but scarcely makes her vivid.Also at the Capitol is another of the Bruce Wilderness Tales, \\"The Natural Born Liar,\\" which the reviewer regrets having had to miss.Other Films.D. W. Griffith's \\"One Exciting Night,\\" which was at the Apollo recently, is at the Strand this week, and \\"When Knighthood Was in Flower,\\" with Marion Davies, which has just ended an engagement at the Criterion, is at the Rivoli. \\"My American Wife,\\" with Gloria Swanson, has moved from the Rivoli to the Rialto.H.

This new offering is entitled \\"The Wanderer,\\" having been adapted from the play of the same name by Maurice V. Samuels, whose effort, presented in February, 1917, was based on Wilhelm Schmidtbonn's drama, \\"Der Verlorene Sohn.\\" It is the story of the prodigal son, amplified in one stretch to the extent of giving one hour on the screen to what is told in eight words in the biblical story. Pictorially it is unquestionably beautiful, and the players acquit themselves with distinction, which is not surprising, considering that parts in this presentation are played by Ernest Torrence, Greta Nissen, the Norwegian actress","excerpt":"William Collier Jr., Ty???one Power, Wallace Beery and Kathlyn Williams.The portion of this picture which is served up rather indelicately deals, of course, with the wanderings of the young man. Jether, who became enamoured of Tisha, the wanton. This is the feature of the film, and much is done with it. An effort is made to point out the error of the ways of Tisha and Jether by having the great city destroyed and most of the inhabitants killed.There are great slaves in this picture whose bodies appear to have been either oiled for the occasion or polished with ???bootblacking. Jether, played by William Collier Jr., is arrayed in all the finery of a Solomon when he goes forth from his father to sow his wild oats. Then we are reminded that loaded dice are not a modern invention, as old Tola (Mr. Torrence) finds them extremely useful in winning the gold from his confrères Jether's caskets of valuables gradually dwindle, as Tisha (Miss Nissen) fawns upon him for a string of pearls and coaxes him continually to give her shoals of shekels. At the rate Jether parts with his wealth, one is surprised that it lasted as long as this stretch of the film.Raoul Walsh, who directed \\"The Thief of Bagdad,\\" is responsible for this unrestrained spectacle. He depicts hands grabbing money and gluttons ???grawing on bones more than once during this narrative, and when the beaten prodigal turns to \\"a citizen of the country\\" for succor, he is sent to feed the swine. Here Mr. Walsh does not content himself by having Jether merely feeding the pigs; but when the youth takes one of the husks for himself, he is lashed in a manner which is not in the least convincing. The whip simply falls on the back of the victim, and one thinks that might tickle but that would not hurt. In such movies there must be the contrast to the gorgeous displays, and, therefore, for that reason, we have the sight of Jether wallowing in a pool of mire and mud, when he might just as easily have walked on the dry fields. Jether falls down after his thrashing and when he stands up, supposed to be in an exhausted condition, he shows his hands covered with mud. Just to give the audience a further conception of his discomfort the producer then depicts a close-up of a hog wallowing in the mire next to the prodigal.There is the scene picturing the hordes of men and women enjoying a repast after the prodigal has been pitched out of the gates. Jether is a stripling, but he must have felt proud that it took three gigantic well-polished Nubians to hurl him out of the city, with a couple more in readiness in the event of successful resistance.This production is intentionally underclad and overfed. It is a circus conception of a Babylonian orgy mixed with excellent stage settings and impressive photography. The players, good as they are, do not look as if they belonged in the story. They wear costumes and gowns that are not suited always to their modern figures. Wallace Beery, as the accepted pirate or seaman of awesome wealth, is clothed in a uniform like that worn by Caesar's guard. His part is a minor one, fortunately, as he looks as if he had one foot in Hollywood and the other in Babylon. Miss Nissen is a gracious and accomplished actress, but she is not especially well suited to playing the part of a siren of past ages.She slurs in her sinuousness and repeats in her gestures and in the exaggerated use of her eyes. Mr. Collier really gives a capital performance, except in one or two of the first scenes, when it seems as if he rather thought the whole idea was comic. Mr. Torrence is effective, but we felt rather surprised when such a suave individual became so impatient with his hoped-for victim that he kicked him toward the fair Tisha. Kathryn Hill is sweet and sympathetic as the good little girl at home.The story as it is told on the screen makes one think of what it would be in modern clothes—just a stubborn son of a millionaire who takes his share of the money and goes to Paris, where, after spending it in wild living, he has to come back steerage or on a cattle steamship.The parable in St. Luke, xv, is told in fewer than 500 words, and after seeing this effusion one wishes that the producers had been less imaginative.

C. Fields, be was wont to say that Philadelphia was the only town of his acquaintance that closed on Sundays. The master, alas, is gone, but his assessment unfortunately lingers. Even love in Philadelphia is brotherly. Nevertheless, for those disposed to see what there is of night life here, there is a Vegas&#8208;style glitter at the nearby Latin Casino (215&#8208;WA 3&#8208;4343) across the Delaware River in Cherry Hill, N.J. The nightly features are the food, the drinks and the likes of Tom Jones and Ray Charles. Considerably hipper is The Spectrum (FU 9&#8208;5000) at Broad and Pattison, right in Philadelphia, a sports hall that books groups like the J. Geils Band for dance concerts. Prices along the nightclub circuit are gradually inching up on those in New York, It is advisable to phone first for covers and minimums. Palumbo's (MA 7.7272) in South Philadelphia, Mayor Frank Rizzo's favorite boite, is big, noisy and serves Sergio Franchi with the spaghetti and scungilli. On the other hand, since Frank Rizzo is the guy who vetoed the purchase for the city of a Jacques Lipchitz statue, dubbing it &#8220;an abortion that looks like some workmen dropped a load of wet plaster,&#8221; those with more worldly sensibilities might prefer a place in which, His Honor would not be caught dead &#8212; Harlow's (WA 2&#8211;9222), named for a former male, whose sex&#8208;change operation made her the switch hit of the city, or if not Harlow's then one of the other trendy clubs nearby. Longhairs and kindred types will feel more at home in the downtown Sansom Village area at places like Artemis (LO 7&#8211;9958), Oops (LO 7&#8211;6800) and Snagletooth (LO 7&#8211;8304), where the sounds are, as they say, heavy. Older heads will like Just Jazz (LO 7&#8211;3189), on downtown Arch Street, where you might hear the MJQ or Jimmy Smith. The Parson's Table (WA 5&#8211;4447) has decent food downstairs, contemporary sound upstairs. Nothing you like?
