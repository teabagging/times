Until now, a good deal of that support has come from dozens of small industrial companies. But now two new commercial office projects, one under construction and the other about to be announced, are expected to further strengthen the tax base while providing more than 1,000 job opportunities for local residents.        The about-to-be-announced project, according to William Walters, community development director in Clifton's Department of Housing and Economic Development, involves a 25-acre vacant site on Route 3 near Valley Road. The site was recently zoned for commercial use in preparation for a 400,000-square-foot office building and a 300-room hotel planned for the parcel. Because the sale of the property is not final, both parties to the negotiations preferred not to discuss details.  The project already in construction is at Brighton Road and Bloomfield Avenue. It is a three-building office complex that will incorporate two new 52,000-square-foot office buildings and an existing 59,000-square- foot structure that will be renovated for office use.

Marianne Faithful is still here, baby, with ''Before the Poison'' (Anti, $17.98) The scruffy East Village anti-folk hero Adam Green is given a British release of his ''Gemstones''; it'll be import-only until next month (Rough Trade, $29.98).

His work settles the age-old fight between sculpture and painting: nearly everything he makes consists of both, tied together visually and sometimes literally.

And with our local Philharmonic under the sure hand of its new Old World maestro, Kurt Masur, the organizations seemed closer in temperament and accomplishment than I would have suspected.   This was partly because in two concerts, Mr. Masur proved that in a relatively brief time, he has helped the New York players produce a robust, almost European sound. There was no sentimentality or strain in the playing. And a stylistic signature seems to have developed in Mr. Masur's conducting as well, heard in singing, well-articulated bass lines that give a strong foundation to the rest of the ensemble.

But over the years, as the area ''South of Houston Street'' has strengthened as a center of galleries, boutiques and restaurants, its shops have lost some of their rough edges. Today sleek custom-designed storefronts are the rule rather than the exception. Some prime spaces in SoHo - generally considered to be the area between Houston and Canal Streets and Sixth Avenue and Broadway -are commanding rents as high as $100 a square foot.   Two new projects on West Broadway, SoHo's main throughfare, epitomize the trend toward a refinement in retailing, which now includes newly built spaces as well as renovations. At 382 West Broadway, between Spring and Broome Streets, the Hammer Construction Corporation has built a two-level, 6,000-square-foot building. Asking rents are about $80 a square foot.

Two developments that illustrate that viewpoint are the Coenties Slip Apartments, a rental project of 42 units in five renovated buildings at the eastern end of the Fraunces Tavern block, and 130 Water Street, a rental building with 122 apartments whose owners hope to convert it to Wall Street's first condominium.   The former has been developed by the Coenties Slip Apartments Company, whose principals are Winthrop D. Chamberlin, Barnet L.  Liberman and Peter L. Malkin.

Theatergoers needing a fix of the Redgrave incandescence can get it, at full  wattage, in the astonishing final 10 minutes of the maddeningly erratic \\"Antony  and Cleopatra\\" she has directed for the Alley Theater here. As Shakespeare's mercurial queen preparing for death, Ms. Redgrave projects a mounting, burnished radiance that mixes girlish bpeathlessness with a ripe, all-consuming eroticism. This is no stately monarch slowly turning to marble but a giddy, transcendently  hopeful bride of death, eager for consummation.

They painted around the same time, similar things, with a similar attitude (a more rose-tinted and nationalistic one than their French counterparts had). So the exhibition argues, and to prove its point it brings together works by Impressionists like William Merritt Chase and Childe Hassam and by Realists like Robert Henri and George Bellows, 83 works in all.   The result? The two schools of painting look even less alike than you would have thought if you had thought about it at all. Or to put it another way, the differences between the Impressionists and the Realists turn out to be much more interesting visually than their similarities. Here's yet another analysis: The show's an intellectual muddle.

Traditional British mystery writers remind us that at heart their stories are nothing less than novels, with memorable characters, engaging backgrounds and incidental information conveyed palatably. To place superior mysteries only on the genre shelf is to diminish their value as serious fiction that has the nerve to be fun.   When they feature familiar detectives -- today's examples are Ruth Rendell's Chief Inspector Reginald Wexford and Anne Perry's Inspector Thomas Pitt and his helpmate, Charlotte Pitt -- they're even more comforting for the reader. Chief Inspector Wexford's venue is Sussex, where, if not careful, we're liable to learn a good deal about life in provincial England. The Pitts operate in Victorian London, where class differences are never forgotten, against a realistic political and historical backdrop.

The stronger and more pertinent of the two is \\"Piet Mondrian's de Stijl Colleagues,\\" organized by Christopher Mount, a curatorial assistant in the department of architecture and design.

Meanwhile, over in Middletown, Wesleyan University is bringing up a Conceptual rear by displaying Mr. LeWitt's collection of work by like-minded contemporaries (through Dec. 20). The Atheneum had a hand in this, too, for while the show is helping to celebrate the university's sesquicentennial, its contents come from the museum, where they are on permanent loan under the curatorship of Andrea Miller-Keller, director of Matrix.   Looking in this context like a rude blue-collar incursion, the Los Angeles paintings cover the 13-foot-high concrete wall that contains the San Fernando Valley Flood Channel known as the Tujunga Wash.  They were designed by Miss Baca and executed by Los Angeles ''untouchables'' - that is to say, adolescents, many of them Chicanos, who have been in trouble with the law.

This is of great interest now, at a time when Freud's discoveries and hypotheses are being questioned and overhauled.

Shot in Lancaster with a distinctively low-gloss look, it presents the lovelorn Dan (played by Dan Cohen, who also wrote and co-directed the film, and is its executive producer). The flimsy setup sends Dan to court to defend himself against harassment charges brought by Vanessa (Dyan Kane), an ex-date who now considers Dan a nuisance.   With their debate moderated by a gavel-swinging judge, the two litigants present conflicting versions of their brief romance. Dan, a sometime nightclub comic who sells magicians' supplies (\\"the rabbits got into the flash powder,\\" he complains), tends to have the rosier memories. He recalls his own amorous efforts as charming, while Vanessa characterizes him as a relentless pest.

Balanchine's first American ballet, \\"Serenade,\\" was created to make use of the mostly limited performing skills of its young dancers. It also alludes to their lives in the studio and possibly to their aspirations, both personal and professional.    Balanchine dismissed such dramatic interpretation, though the plangent Tchaikovsky score he chose cries out for such a view. And \\"Serenade\\" was performed here as a brisk outpouring of dance and shifting patterns. Of the three lead ballerinas, Maria Calegari best caught the undercurrent of emotion that propels the ballet along its course. There were moments when Darci Kistler looked like her wonderfully reckless old spirit. But the womanliness with which she now dances gave her arms and upper body a theatricality that seemed too much for the ballet, more like a drenching of perfume than a discreet dab.

Veselin Topalov, a 30-year-old Bulgarian grandmaster who is ranked No. 1 in the world, and who won the championship tournament organized by the World Chess Federation last month in Argentina, has rejected an offer to play Vladimir Kramnik, a Russian grandmaster who is also 30, said Mr. Topalov's manager, Silvio Danailov. Mr. Kramnik, who is ranked No. 7 and did not play in last month's tournament, bases his claim to the title on his defeat of Garry Kasparov in a 2000 match. The proposal for the match -- with a promise of a $1.4 million prize fund -- came from a German company, Universal Event Promotion, which was created to stage it. Mr. Danailov said Mr. Topalov, above, was willing to play the match on three conditions: that Mr. Kramnik be the challenger, that the prize be at least $2.4 million, and that it take place under the auspices of the World Chess Federation.
