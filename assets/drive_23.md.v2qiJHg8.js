The program, one of four in which the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center will take a bird's-eye view of more than eight decades of 20th-century music, was introduced by Charles Wadsworth in the hyperventilating, purposely corny style that the society's regular patrons know so well and evidently appreciate. Review/Music","excerpt":"Chamber Society Explores the 20th Century"},{"year":"1991","title":"Like many other musical institutions, the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center, which opened its season on Sunday afternoon with a concert in Alice Tully Hall, is in transition. In the last few years, attendance has been dropping and the number of concerts has decreased. And the cellist Fred Sherry will be leaving the post of artistic director at the end of this season.   Moreover, despite changes in personnel and in repertory during the last decade, Sunday's concert was not all that different in effect and style from those I remember from the early 1980's. The repertory was miscellaneous to a fault, lacking a theme or a design, while the playing was polished, energetic, expert -- and astonishingly dull. Review/Music","excerpt":"Chamber Society Navigates Transition"},{"year":"1996","title":"The Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center has weathered its share of criticism for underprepared performances over the years, and many New Yorkers have come to take the group for granted as one of the countless ensembles that putter along competently, if not always excitingly, from season to season. But in his four years as artistic director of the society, David Shifrin has refined the ensemble, bringing in players whose interpretive sympathies are congruent, and who regularly work together outside the society.    MUSIC REVIEW","excerpt":"Chamber Society Takes an Energetic Approach to Mozart"},{"year":"1993","title":"Lincoln Center took a chance when it established a resident Chamber Music Society in 1969. Although not entirely moribund, chamber music was a backwater then. Several string quartets and mixed-timbre groups toured and made recordings, and depending on how one approached it, the repertory was either the nectar of connoisseurs or the height of elitist stuffiness.   But classical-music elitism was not yet the whipping boy it has lately become, and it was possible in those days to redefine a supposedly elitist repertory as revolutionary and egalitarian, by virtue of its one-player-to-a-part structure. The folksy charm of the society's founding director, Charles Wadsworth, gave this new populist image a push. By the late 1970's, Mr. Wadsworth and his group were widely credited with starting a chamber music boom.

She has  learned to harness the energy of her long legs and long arms, though her command of technical events like hurdles and the high jump is still considered imperfect, her talent raw.         Against the odds, Shouaa won the Asian Games in 1994 with 6,360 points. Her reward, from Syria's President, Hafez al-Assad, was a new house and a Peugeot. At the 1995 World Championships, where Joyner-Kersee didn't compete in the heptathlon, she took the gold with a score of 6,651 points. Now 22, Shouaa is considered a real threat to Joyner-Kersee's heptathlon hegemony.
