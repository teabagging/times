As in \\"Skippy,\\" the youthful players in this current screen work are Jackie Cooper, who, of course, impersonates Skippy","excerpt":"Bobby Coogan, who appears as Sooky, and Jackie Searl, who plays Sidney, a name he inherited from the film \\"Tom Sawyer.\\" These youngsters are not to be blamed because this film is somewhat disappointing, for no fault is to be found with their performances. The story, one adapted from Percy Crosby's book \\"Dear Sooky,\\" lacks a good deal, including the interest afforded by the dog of the previous production.Here there is too much gunning for tears, and the idea of having Sooky's mother die scarcely adds anything to the story. Norman Taurog, the director, who also produced \\"Skippy,\\" seems to have been handicapped by the script of the present tale, in which Skippy is too noble; so good, in fact, that he scarcely has a chance to show himself in his true colors, or as he was in the other picture.Now and again, however, a welcome note of cheer is struck. Skippy has military aspirations and he annoys his father by having not one but several alarm clocks in the morning sound a sort of reveille. He has a penchant for blowing a bugle, and later Sooky also becomes the proud owner of one of these instruments. When Sooky blows on it, the noise is not precisely melodious, but his swollen cheeks tell one that he is doing all a boy of 5 can to extract music from his bugle.The reason for this martial spirit arises from the formation of a cadet corps, known to this Indiana town as the Boone Boys. The officer of this budding fighting force is Sidney, who likes to be addressed as General. Skippy is invited to join this uniformed contingent, but, unselfishly, he prefers to spend the money, given to him by his father to buy a uniform, on Sooky and the latter's mother. He forms the Beagle Boys, an organization with a General and one private, Sooky being the private.General Skippy and Private Sooky one day decide to call upon General Sidney. Skippy is longing to punch Sidney, but one gathers that he has a certain compunction about doing so in the face of the Boone Boys. He takes a chance, however, by first asking Sidney whether he can make his \\"men\\" do right-about-face, and when the backs of Sidney's troops are turned he gives Sidney a swift jab on the chin.In the closing episode of this film Skippy permits Sooky to put on a uniform which his father has just bought him. The boys go to bed, and Sooky wears the uniform, including the cap, as he is tucked in by Mrs. Skinner, Skippy's sympathetic mother.Master Cooper assuredly makes the most of his part. Little Coogan takes the whole affair very seriously. His childish way of talking is at times very effective. Young Searl rises to the occasion as the little tell-tale and spoiled boy. Willard Robinson does well as Skippy's father and Enid Bennett is excellent as Skippy's devoted mother.

As hundreds of fans cheered and two dozen previously certified immortals looked on, the three were inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in a ceremony that evoked summertime memories spanning five decades.   For the 48-year-old McCovey, who played most of his 22-season, 521-home run career in the shadow of his acclaimed Giant teammate, Willie Mays, it was a singular honor. Only the 16th player to be elected to what he called ''the ultimate team'' in his first year of eligibility, McCovey, who retired after the 1980 season, was the only player named to the hall this year by the members of the Baseball Writers Association of America, the group charged with making the selections during a player's initial, 15-year period of eligibility, which begins five years after retirement.

Mr. Previte is more of an arranger and structuralist than a melody writer, and the pieces set up texture after texture, moving from rubato washes of sound, where most of the members of the group soloed together in the foreground, to hard-driving and odd-angled funk. Improvisers played alone, or against the rhythm section, and instruments paired up to play melodies or sounds. Mr. Previte keeps things going: no section overstayed its welcome.

Bathed in white light, the bodies seem to fall through space as they are held high, odd-angled, in lifts or perch on top of other bodies reclining on the floor. The stage is as deep and dark as the black, empty sky on a screen behind the dancers, a sky filled, as is the stage, with odd shapes that look like pieces of planets or extraterrestrial artifacts.    There are several warmer, more human occurrences: a near-kiss or two and a funny sequence in which two men kept falling out of a neat row and against an increasingly exasperated third male dancer. This mysterious ritual of a dance, provocatively lighted by Jeff Nash, was set to some haunting Celtic music in a collage that featured scores by Philip Corner, Fast Forward and Arvo Part. And the performers looked and moved like compellingly human angels in a fine cast made up of Gary Onsum, Annie-B Parson, Nadine Helstroffer, Eun-Gyu Lee, Song Won Kang, Gennevieve Lam, Bill McCully and Richard Siegal.

It's a grand scheme, this, one that jettisons the catchall phrase \\"body lotion\\" in favor of more anatomically precise titles. Here's just a tiny sampling of their efforts: Progres Throat Creme (Lancome), Neck Firming Cream (Jeanne Gatineau), Firming Gelee for Neck and Decollete (Orlane), Firming Concentrate for Bust (Gatineau again), Bio-Buste (Biotherm), Bust Firming Gel (Clarins, the grande dame of subspecies, has no less than seven different \\"buste beauty boosters\\"), Stomach Firming Treatment (Biotherm), Energizing Emulsion for Tired Legs (Clarins). . . . Stop me before I need a good dose of Princess Marcella Borghese Terme di Montecatini Splendide Mani (a.k.a. hand cream) to revive my digits.   From a marketing standpoint, you can't fault the concept, for with the aging of the population comes a peculiar, almost fetishistic obsession with the decay of the various body parts. And if you tap into that complicated package of hopes and fears, you've got your customer. I certainly worry about sundry bits and pieces of my own anatomy, so I'm a prime target for this kind of salesmanship.

At the Beacon Theater on Thursday night, performing the first of six solo acoustic shows, Mr. Young spent most of his set sitting down, but his body was always rocking slowly back and forth. His boot struck the floor in an easy front-porch rhythm, and his left hand made a strumming motion even when it wasn't actually hitting the strings. Mr. Young's acoustic style is like no one else's. In a single sweep he controls percussion, rhythm and melody, his thumb striking a bass note that resonates through the entire chord, his fingers picking delicate notes off the high strings. He is hushed, but never static.   Mr. Young's acoustic shows are the latest installment in his singularly unpredictable career: a mere number of months after releasing \\"Weld,\\" the heavy-grunge live album from his \\"Ragged Glory\\" tour, and its companion piece, \\"Arc,\\" (both on Reprise), a 35-minute opus of feedback and electric guitar distortion, he has flipped to the other side of the coin. With the exception of a few old favorites like \\"Heart of Gold,\\" \\"Long May You Run,\\" \\"Sugar Mountain\\" and a version of \\"After the Gold Rush\\" played on an ornate antique organ, his set was devoted exclusively to new material from a coming album titled \\"Harvest Moon,\\" intended as a sequel to his 1972 album \\"Harvest.\\" Review/Pop","excerpt":"Body Language And Plain Lyrics"},{"year":"1991","title":"I have always loved backs. I wonder what it says about me, that I worship a part of the body that signals a turning away. Does it mean I'm a glutton for abandonment, or a timid voyeur who prefers a surreptitious gaze that will not be met and challenged? I only know I have often felt the deepest love at just that moment when the beloved turns her back toward me to get some sleep.\\n\\nAnyone who has ever walked behind a pretty woman in a backless gown can attest to the subtle allure of this part of the anatomy. How sharply can a good pair of shoulder blades, heightened by shadow, pierce the viewers gaze. They have the chiseled eloquence of cheekbones.

Of all the parts of the body that can be caressed or kissed, the brow is the most accessible and the most mysterious, just as sensual as more celebrated body parts but less frightening. It hides only the mind.   If you think about it, when you kiss another's brow you're just on the other side of the real seat of desire. It's easy to forget about it, because of the tantalizing proximity of the eyes and the mouth, and the distraction of the hair, and the curious digression of the eyebrows, and the inconvenient protuberance of the nose, but mainly because we situate desire elsewhere. The truth is, your lips are just millimeters away from where the real action is, inside the skull. But that's part of the brow's charm -- its hypocritical blankness. It's just a dull intermission between the hair and the eyebrows if you neglect to remember the electrical impulses sprinting hither and yon in the porous gray stuff under the smooth bone covered by soft, soft skin.

It is, however, pretty much impossible to have an affair without seeing your partner's feet. Which is why, for me, the real moment of truth is when the socks, not the shorts, come off.

Start in any direction and you pass through landscapes designated by the hybrid terms (Latin with much seasoning from English) of anatomy. Go far enough back up the side and you'll reach the lower edge of the chest, the \\"costal margin,\\" formed by the cartilaginous parts of the seventh to tenth ribs. Or travel diagonally up the abdominal wall in the general direction of the navel.

You will be nearly over the diaphragm, most thoroughly exercised by squalling babies and singers.

For of all body parts, the knee is the most ill-conceived and badly made: subject to all the indignities of age, its task an unending succession of demands encompassing the banal (kneeling to pick up Kitty Litter) to the demented (super-marathons) to the sublime (squatting to deliver babies in the bush).\\n\\nAnd yet, whether on flat ground or mountains, on grass or sand or pavement, barefoot or in snowshoes, sneakers or skis, we expect patella and ligament, tendons and cartilage to do their work in modesty and silence, free from pain and swelling and the slings (if not the Ace bandages or knee braces) of outrageous fortune -- all while crammed together in an ill-lighted space smaller than most grapefruits! Caressed by no massage, anointed with no oils, succored by little more than an ice pack, this overworked bridge between the femur and tibia suffers little but abuse -- until on occasion a horrendous POP is heard and then it's off to the insults and invasions of the modern operating table, with its scissors, scalpels and mini-dash video cameras.

Like good poetry, his best dances have a way of speaking truths in a language that is familiar but not quite of the everyday world. Those truths have often been about how moving bodies defined the empty space around them. But over the last few years the choreographer, now 84, seems to be zeroing in on body shapes, parts and gentle eccentricities, as he does in \\"Each Time You Carry Me This Way,\\" a 1993 work performed by the Erick Hawkins Dance Company on Thursday night at the Joyce Theater.    The theme of the dance, which is set to a vividly atmospheric score by Lucia Dlugoszewski, is how to carry and be carried. Mr. Hawkins suggests a remarkable variety of emotions and relationships with just the angle of the held body or the way it holds onto its moving carrier. Dancers spill out of the stage wings, lapping leftward across the stage in staggered processionals and pools of moving bodies.

After the painting, petroleum jelly and flour are applied to the finished pattern, which is then wrapped in cotton cloth and covered with plastic wrap for several hours. The pattern lasts for weeks and the erotic scent can linger for days. Khithab is technically forbidden in Islam because it is not water soluble, so the religiously conservative use black hair dye. With body painting, it is the more modern women of the Yemeni elite who prefer the more traditional. \\"Khithab is better than a miniskirt,\\" says Maha, \\"and more fun than crazy stockings.\\" SUNDAY, August 6, 1995","excerpt":"BODY WORK: Yemen's Painted Ladies"},{"year":"1923","title":"RACING COMMISSION PROPOSED FOR CANADA","excerpt":"Body Would Have Entire Charge of Sport All Over the Dominion."},{"year":"1923","title":"body brought from France to Franklin, Pa, thought to be that of Jno D Ross, is identified as B E Naile's, after Ross's own body arrives SOLDIERS' GRAVES MIXUP.","excerpt":"Body Wrongly Burled Is Identified When That Belonging There Arrives"},{"year":"1934","title":"Marylebone CC to submit question of body-line bowling to the counties CRICKET ISSUE PASSED.","excerpt":"Body-Line Bowling Question Is Submitted to Counties."},{"year":"1956","title":"10,520 idle in 5 plants as body-trim workers strike over production standards STRIKE SLOWS CHRYSLER","excerpt":"Body-Trim Walkout Makes 10,520 Idle in 5 Plants"},{"year":"1981","title":"t was a championship professional football game in the days long before Super Bowls in sunny climes, and the wind-chill factor at ground level in the stadium wac well below zero.

The whisky was especially useless, for it was necessary to remove a glove and dig into a pocket to extract the frigid metal flask, and by the time this maneuver was completed, more heat was lost in the wind than could possibly be gained from the beverage. Besides, its flavor was foul. My stamina held out only until half-time, when I trudged with numb feet out of the stadium and into the nearest public building, a restaurant whose neon lights beckoned warmly.   For some unknown reason, a dusty bottle of tawny Port with a faded label stood upright on a shelf behind the bar.

The decade also gave rise to cool-handed artists like Richard Prince, currently the subject of a major show at the Whitney Museum of American Art, who photographed images of the sleek fashion models and macho cowboys found in magazines. Between the two extremes, activity was also fast and furious, and wildly varied.   And it still is. The fact that the body has become a canvas of conflict is hardly surprising in an age of AIDS, racial riots and new and bitter battles over the rights of women and gays.
