Mr. Langsner's farcical romp, playing at the Repertorio Espanol's Gramercy Park Theater, traps all of its conniving characters in one form of personal scandal or other to expose their greed, hypocrisy, mendacity, lust and mere sloth.

In the first half of the program, a few errant passages apart, the group played with taut ensemble, secure intonation and buoyant rhythm, showing a commitment and vitality this listener has not heard from it in years. But in the second half, in Tchaikovsky's Quartet in D (Op. 11), the Guarneri reverted to recent form, with slurred phrases, slithery intonation, lifeless pizzicatos and a general lack of focus.   Perhaps the relative unfamiliarity of the other offerings induced greater concentration.

Many of the families, Lowells, Lawrences, Coolidges, were related. They were great industrial visionaries, who thought big and built big. Until about 1914, the year of the famous Lawrence strike, the political control of the mills was almost absolute.   As your Sept. 7 editorial states, the Lowell museum is a tribute to the people who worked in the mills, but it is also a reminder of the industrial mayhem and financial chicanery that the bankers and mill managers perpetrated on the people of the Merrimack Valley.

F. K. Fisher was a solitary, eloquent voice in the gastronomic wilderness of America. Matters have changed, but her argument on behalf of an \\"open-eyed delight\\" in food is still timely. This is from the 1937 book \\"Serve It Forth,\\" included in \\"The Art of Eating\\" (Collier/Macmillan, paper).      France eats more consciously, more intelligently, than any other nation. It may be quails    financiere,    or it may be a stew concocted from the rabbit that Papa Jacques caught yesterday under the hedge. . . . In Paris and in the village there is a gusto, a frank sensuous realization of food, that is pitifully unsuspected in, say, the college boarding-house or corner cafe of an American town. In America we eat, collectively, with a glum urge for food to fill us. We are ignorant of flavor. We are as a nation taste-blind. . . . Ten million men rush every noontime for their ham-on-white and cherry Coke. Those ten million men may die taste-blind as well as stomach-ulcered, unless they are shocked into recognition of their own powers of enjoyment. It might be good if you could go to them, quietly, and say, \\"Please, sir, stop a minute and listen to me. . . .\\" Some of those ten million men would listen. Some of them would eat with their minds for the first time. Translating the World      Our vision of science as a practice grounded in objectivity omits, George Johnson reminds us, the influence of the observer on what is being studied. This is from \\"In the Palaces of Memory\\" (Knopf).      Wherever one decides to draw the line between the subjective and the objective, it is clear that we don't stand outside creation like gods, with the power to describe the world with perfect objectivity. It is not just that we affect what we observe by the very act of observation","excerpt":"the world is filtered through our senses, and the information is processed and sorted into patterns by our brains. We only see light in a tiny band of the electromagnetic spectrum. We see what our nervous system allows us to see. The universe would be a very different place for a creature whose brain was wired according to another blueprint, who sampled the world through portals we can only imagine. Science, then, is not a description of the physical world, but a description of how the world interacts with the mind -- and how experience is translated into the structures we call memories. Vanishing Culture      Samuel Lipman reminds us of the sadly diminished place of the idea of culture as a practice, as a state one aspires to, in our lives. This is from \\"Arguing for Music, Arguing for Culture: Essays\\" (Godine, paper).      A century ago, culture meant an ideal of intellectual and spiritual aspiration -- the \\"study of perfection,\\" as Matthew Arnold put it in    Culture and Anarchy    (1869). The Germans meant something very similar when they talked early in the nineteenth century of    Kultur   . In our own time, culture has come to mean no more than a description of observed behavior. . . . Of the former conception of culture as an aspiration to accomplishment and as the achievement of that aspiration, there now remains precious little. Of respect for culture existing outside the marketplace, for culture existing beyond the techniques of marketing, there is little more than a memory existing in the minds of the old. In its place we have what can only be called an entertainment industry, the matching of vulgar offerings with popular tastes through the agency of publicity and manufactured glamour. Simple, Honest Ornament      The unique American appetite for simplicity in design emerged, Arthur J. Pulos argues, from the special demands of pioneer life. This is from \\"American Design Ethic: A History of Industrial Design to 1940\\" (MIT, paper).      In the wilderness and the new settlements of America, the colonist was obliged to avoid the devotion to rich detail and elaborate ornament that served in the older aristocracies to exaggerate the value of products through the extravagant consumption of energy. Therefore, whatever esthetic reward the American was to derive from his products had to be found in the economy of means and the purification of form to purpose and from the soundness of proportion and the clarity of symbolic form that inevitably result. The natural texture of his materials and the honest marks of his tools were ornament enough for the settler. The fingerprint in the clay, the scar of the adze on the wooden beam, the facets of the hammer on metal, and the warp and weft of the loom all provided the democratizing link that bound maker and consumer to product. Guardians of Grace and Wit      Germaine Greer recollects her liberating discovery, while an adolescent, of the special delights of libraries in this passage from her memoir \\"Daddy, We Hardly Knew You\\" (Fawcett Columbine, paper).      As in the British Museum, the circular reading room was domed in glass, with long tables radiating from a mahogany core towards the book-lined walls. I used to take a turn or two round the perimeter just to get the feel of bookish gloom, the patina of polished wood and leather, and my heart skipped with suppressed excitement. . . . My dream was to live in this heavenly building and know all its secrets, to have the right to put cards with my writing on them into the catalogue file, to be allowed to go behind the curving book-clad walls into the stacks and have keys to unlock the cabinets of bookish rarities. . . . Libraries are reservoirs of strength, grace and wit, reminders of order, calm and continuity, lakes of mental energy, neither warm nor cold, light nor dark. The pleasure they give us is steady, unorgastic, reliable, deep and long-lasting. In any library in the world, I am at home, unselfconscious, still and absorbed.

EDWARD SOREL  Cartoonist  Friendly to Families  \\"The Maltese Falcon\\" Sam Spade, a good role model for today's youth, promises Brigid that he'll wait for her while she gains maturity in a maximum-security institution. \\"Deep Throat\\" An inspiring story of a woman with a physical handicap who nevertheless becomes a useful member of society. \\"Triumph of the Will\\" When men are not impeded from their God-given right to carry guns, cleanliness and happiness follow. Nightmares of Depravity  \\"Mary Poppins\\" The heroine is a governess who uses trickery to get her job. \\"Honey, I Shrunk the Kids\\" Just when there is a need for films about safety precautions in the home, Disney gives us this. ANDREW SULLIVAN  Editor, The New Republic  Friendly to Families  \\"Crimson Tide\\" Superb moralistic drama in which the rule of law is contrasted with the rule of man. Aristotle couldn't have taught this instructive lesson any better. \\"Priest\\" Sincere Roman Catholic cleric fails to be celibate but abides by confessional confidentiality, and by divine intervention incest is uncovered. Didactic but effective exploration of family values. \\"Quiz Show\\" Middlebrow morality tale in which telling the truth is the ultimate indicator of character. Nightmares of Depravity  \\"Home Alone\\" Delinquent parents lose a child, who proceeds to wreak revenge by graphically mutilating new companions. The child takes sadistic pleasure in inflicting hideous pain and is deemed a hero. \\"J. F. K.\\" Propagandistic, nihilist, dishonest, paranoid and unpatriotic. Hard to say which characteristic kiddies should be told to avoid most. VICTOR NAVASKY  Publisher and editorial director, The Nation  Friendly to Families  \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" A family beset with the woes brought upon by the Depression sets forth against every kind of adversity and gets closer by fighting the system. \\"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\\" Jimmy Stewart takes on the system with the help of a woman he is going to marry, as well as his mother and those boys all over America who see him as a model. \\"Natural Born Killers\\" Oliver Stone takes the television-sitcom view of the family to its logical conclusion and shows that it has no relation to real family values. Nightmares of Depravity  \\"True Lies\\" I haven't seen \\"True Lies,\\" but neither has Dole. From what I understand, it's full of violence. And especially if you're an Arab, it's very anti-family values, since Arabs get killed by the bushel. \\"Hamlet\\" The guy kills his uncle and all that, but I think Hamlet can go in either category. He loves his mother a lot, which suggests to me that the anti-family category is an unsatisfactory one. BARBARA EHRENREICH  Essayist  Friendly to Families  \\"Dolores Claiborne\\" Edifying because it shows a woman cleverly disposing of her abusive husband, and it ends with the woman and her daughter drawing closer together. \\"Braveheart\\" It portrays my Scottish ancestors more accurately than usual. It shows them with uncombed hair and dirty fingernails, living in windowless huts. A little humility is good in any family lineage. Nightmares of Depravity  \\"Legends of the Fall\\" Sons disobey their father and fight in a senseless war, and one becomes a corrupt politician. Furthermore, it tries to portray families without women. \\"Mr. Mom\\" and \\"Mrs. Doubtfire\\" Movies in this tradition portray either a motherless family or an absent, career-driven mom. KATHRYN HARRISON  Novelist  Friendly to Families  \\"A Woman Under the Influence\\" It portrays real heroism in the daily struggle to maintain a family. The mother is troubled, possibly mentally ill or an alcoholic, and you see that family reflects a delicate balance.  \\"Ladybird, Ladybird\\" Completely unsentimental portrayal of a woman struggling against forces that are huge. The effort to maintain a family is very affecting. \\"Tender Mercies\\" An honest movie that suggests redemption is possible. You can make bad mistakes and you can't undo them, but it's possible to keep a family together. Nightmares of Depravity  \\"Down and Out in Beverly Hills\\" Mindless trivialization of social ills like homelessness and anorexia. Even the dog has an eating disorder. \\"Dumb and Dumber\\" American society is not only suspicious of intellectualism, but now we have movies that glorify imbecility. MICHAEL LERNER  Editor of Tikkun magazine  Friendly to Families  \\"Schindler's List\\" It encourages a sense of trust in others and the possibility of goodness triumphing over self-interest. \\"Panther\\" It encourages people to believe that narrow self-interest, in this case a drug-oriented and self-indulgent culture, can be transcended by commitment to a community. \\"The Piano\\" A vision of the possibility of overcoming chauvinism, transcending a sexist relationship and a woman finding her own power. Nightmares of Depravity  \\"Rambo\\" Perfectly depraved. It takes the individual seeking to break all the rules to establish a higher truth, without regard to the consequences of others and with unrestricted use of violence. \\"Pulp Fiction\\" A popular movie among people who think of themselves as hip because it's self-reflective about its own violence. It makes it easier to live in the world of Bosnia and right-wing militias. PAUL RUDNICK  Playwright  Friendly to Families  \\"Mommie Dearest\\" The title alone bespeaks a return to traditional values and happier homes. At last, a film that showcases a celebrity as a concerned parent and a firm disciplinarian. \\"The Terminator\\" and \\"Terminator 2\\" Senator Dole rightly cited the Republican stalwart Arnold Schwarzenegger as a family asset. In the first \\"Terminator\\" film, Arnold was an evil robot from the future, but in the sequel he was a good robot from the future. Bob Dole is, of course, a good robot from the past. \\"Basic Instinct\\" Some viewers may find intimate conversations a bit embarrassing, so sometimes it's advisable just to pile the kids into the Bronco, head for a Sharon Stone movie and point. Nightmares of Depravity  \\"Beethoven\\" As prophesied in Leviticus, Satan always appears in earthly guise as either a big, sloppy, huggable sheepdog, an endangered whale or Shirley MacLaine in character parts. \\"The Lion King\\" As Senator Dole has indicated, American pop culture can be all too influential. This led to tragedy when after watching a cassette of this Disney hit, my 6-year-old nephew was taken to the zoo, where he crawled into a cage and was mauled when he tried to force a lion cub to hula.

The World Of Nature","excerpt":"The World The World"},{"year":"1992","title":"From America, China's leaders look tough, dangerous and maddeningly contemptuous of international opinion. From close up, they look worried about adverse international trends, frightened by their post-Tiananmen isolation and willing to make pragmatic concessions.   There's no getting around many pernicious Chinese policies. But by understanding Beijing's state of mind, Washington can respond in ways that increase American leverage.   Beijing offends international decency in a variety of ways. It profits from prison labor and tolerates copyright piracy. It relentlessly persecutes people who campaign for democracy and for self-rule in Tibet. It supplies arms to Myanmar's murderous State Law and Order Restoration Council and, until recently, to Cambodia's genocidal Khmer Rouge. It exports missiles to Syria and shares nuclear technology with Iran, Algeria and Pakistan.    When other countries protest, Beijing accuses them of impermissible interference in Chinese domestic affairs or colonialist trampling on China's culture and sovereignty.   No context can justify China's misdeeds or negate the need for a vigorous American response. The challenge for Washington is to find responses likely to yield constructive results.    Deng Xiaoping and his hard-line allies crushed the 1989 democracy protests because they believed their survival was at stake. Now, Beijing believes it has restored political stability. China's rulers are unlikely to agree to release all political prisoners immediately for fear of resurrecting a powerful movement. But they can and should be pressed toward leniency, case by case.    Prison exports and copyright violations grow out of the lawless atmosphere created by decades of revolutionary convulsions. China's leaders are, on their own, taking steps toward rebuilding the rule of law. These trade abuses also reflect Beijing's desperate drive to accumulate hard currency for development. For Washington to threaten stiff trade sanctions if these practices persist is both appropriate and effective.   China's arms sales to tyrants and belligerents is deplorable. But until the U.S. renounces such sales for itself, it cannot credibly demand purity from China. U.S. diplomats have consistently raised arms sales and proliferation issues with Beijing, sometimes to good effect. These efforts are worth continuing, and toughening.   Last month China assured Secretary of State Baker that it would soon ratify the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Even now, Beijing is said to be applying treaty rules to its civilian nuclear cooperation with Iran. China has also been prepared, for its own reasons, to discourage North Korea from developing nuclear weapons.   When viewed from Beijing, the Bush Administration's China policies seem tougher than many American critics think. U.S. sanctions against China stayed in place far longer than Europe's or Japan's. And while top leaders of other Western countries are again visiting Beijing, America has limited official travel to a tough-talking working visit by the Secretary of State.    America is now in an excellent position to work for changes in China. But to do so, the Administration needs to rebuild a consensus on policy toward Beijing. That consensus collapsed not only because of Beijing's murderous repression, but also President Bush's repeated stumbles in the months following the Tiananmen massacre.    The ideal way to undo the damage would be for the public to hear a clear articulation of U.S. values and purposes, direct from President Bush.

Kaufman's clever comedy \\"The Butter and Egg Man,\\" now on view at the Hippodrome, has been pulled down to a low level of intelligence, the producers having carefully excluded all the delightful nuances and adroit subtleties of the original. The skeleton of the story is left, but that is about all.Jack Mulhall, who has his limitations in pictures, is cast in the part of Peter Jones, a rôle so skillfully acted before the footlights by the late Gregory Kelly. Mr. Mulhall fails to sense what's wanted in the character, and he and the director, Richard Wallace, make the young man so silly that one wonders that he is even permitted at large. This character is one of those who unfortunately are depicted in films only too often. Peter Jones in shadow form is not even a shadow of the original, but merely an irritating dolt trying vainly to create laughter.This picture is of course all the more disappointing after seeing the play. It has a few good sequences, notably those in which Sam Hardy appears. Mr. Hardy impersonates Joseph Lehman, the theatrical producer who finds himself and his partner, Jack McClure, paid back in their own coin, or hoist with their own petard. Mr. Hardy really does quite well with his rôle, and now and again Mr. Kaufman's lines are used to advantage, but more often than not Mr. Kaufman's bon mots are attached to scenes that render them ineffectual. Mrs. Lehman's priceless utterance, \\"That'll give you a rough idea of my condition,\\" is almost lost in a sea of stupidity. Mrs. Lehman, acted by Gertrude Astor, appears to remember suddenly that she must appear intoxicated, but there are instants when she looks as sober as a judge.It is another instance where the producers have sought to make a story more popular, and in doing so they have sapped it of its originality and its charm.Greta Nissen is capable as the actresss Mary Martin.

Immediately stories begin to proliferate, right from the bottom of the page upward, in a stew of creation and discovery, communication and concealment.    CASTLES OF STEEL: Britain, Germany, and the Winning of the Great War at Sea, by Robert K. Massie. (Random House, $35.) Continuing his ''Dreadnought'' of 1991, this elegant writer pursues World War I at sea, sharply focused on the Battle of Jutland in May 1916, the closest approach history would ever provide to the forthright slugging match the dreadnought fleets were invented for; it was indecisive.    OLD SCHOOL, by Tobias Wolff. (Knopf, $22.) Wolff's first novel, which greatly resembles his life as he has told it in two books of memoirs, concerns a prep school boy, his lower-middle, partly Jewish background disguised, who is obsessed both with writing and with dissembling -- activities that have a great deal in common.    MR. TIMOTHY, by Louis Bayard. (HarperCollins, $24.95.) Tiny Tim, as we know, did not die; he grew up to walk without a crutch and to be the narrator of this novel, to escape, with Scrooge's help, from his low-class family, and to save a 10-year-old girl from some nasty men in an updated Dickensian catena of escapes and manifestations that gets resolved on Christmas Day.    I SAILED WITH MAGELLAN, by Stuart Dybek. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $24.) Grim urban struggle and nostalgic teenage guilty sex coincide in this story collection with a single narrator, Perry Katzek, in a Chicago long abandoned by James T. Farrell's Irish, now occupied by Poles, Mexicans and Italians. Perry, a Sensitive Kid, plays the clarinet, collects butterflies and gives a vivid sense of his neighbors' inner lives.    SEA OF GLORY: America's Voyage of Discovery, the U.S. Exploring Expedition, 1838-1842, by Nathaniel Philbrick. (Viking, $27.95.) A fascinating, meticulous account of an immense (six ships, 346 men) project intended to produce charts for American whalers; the last all-sail mission to circumnavigate the globe, it logged 87,000 miles in four years but lost recognition when Americans took to expanding westward on the ground.    A TIME OF OUR CHOOSING: America's War in Iraq, by Todd S. Purdum and the staff of The New York Times. (Times Books/Holt, $25.) A guide to the causes, conduct and consequences, deftly woven by Purdum into a coherent narrative; with a chronology since 9/11/01.    THE EARLY STORIES: 1953-1975, by John Updike. (Knopf, $35.) The 103 stories in this volume, some of them published when he was 21, are witnesses to a marvel of prodigious production (during the same years he produced seven novels and five books of poetry). Their principal themes tend to be eros and God (i.e., women and death) but they happen in a generally propitious America, where life is rarely really unbearable.

Mr. Maccoby correctly argues that Jesus was crucified by Pontius Pilate because He was perceived as a threat to Roman power.   But the nature of that threat - confused by the scriptural riddles written into that terrible day - may be much more profound than Mr. Maccoby imagines. He solves these riddles too neatly with the simple, somewhat surrealistic theory that Jesus and the political activist Barabbas were one and the same. He suggests that the ''duplication'' arose because the Gospel writers had been saddled with ''the awkward tradition that when Jesus was in prison, the Jewish masses called for His release.'' (Thus, their call supposedly had been masked by the Evangelists in a demand for the release of ''Jesus Barabbas.'')

Berlin's Year at the Spring","excerpt":"THE YEAR AT THE SPRING IN BERLIN"},{"year":"1939","title":"The distinction of opening each new season at the Filmarte traditionally is reserved for a distinguished French film. The curtain-raiser last year was \\"Grand Illusion\\"","excerpt":"the year before it was \\"Mayerling\\"; the year before that, \\"La Kermesse Heroique.\\" The Filmarte is making no exceptions this season, come heil or high water. Once again it is putting its best footage forward and, in \\"The End of a Day,\\" which had its première last night, it is presenting one of the great films of any screen year, an enduring and eloquent work that cannot fail of consideration when those cinematic bookkeepers, the New York film critics, start toting up the year's bests next January.Last night's performance was for the benefit of the Actors Fund of America—an appropriate gesture, since the story of the film is that of a home for old actors, a reliquary of glorious memories, a restless tomb for dreams that never were fulfilled. It is a sentimental film, as such things must always be; but it is droll, too, and almost cruelly objective. Charles Spaak, who wrote it; Julien Duvivier, who directed it, and the fine cast that played it have stoutly resisted the theme's inherent tendency toward self-pity and self-ridicule. Nothing would have been more banal or bathetic than an actor's home filled with mirror-posing Hamlets or dear old ladies bent over yellowed scrapbooks. Simply for the record, and as a tribute to Gallic self-control, there are none of them in the film.It has taken more imagination and a keener perception of probable fact to fill the actors' asylum with men like Michel Simon's impish yet tragic Cabrissade, who played pranks to maintain the illusion of youth and wrote his own fulsome eulogy to keep from even his dead ears the bitter truth that he never had been anything but an understudy. And with men like Victor Francen's Marny—austere, aloof, too intellectual in his approach to his profession to have stirred the hearts of his public. Or with men like Louis Jouvet's fascinating and pathological St. Clair, a former matinee idol and Don Juan, who had to preserve his reputation by sending himself love letters and tried to hypnotize a barmaid into suicide to feed his mad ego.These are, of course, the extremes among the inmates, and not their cross-section. Duvivier's understanding of them is too thorough, too temperate, too sympathetic to permit him to shape their drama deliberately into farce or into melodrama. To see it as a whole one would also have to recall the beautifully happy old couple who sat hand in hand through the film, speaking of their children and grandchildren and deciding finally to get married.To see it whole one would have to hear the speeches at the protest meeting, when all the guests (\\"inmates\\" is such a harsh word) voted to demand a radio in every room and two free stamps a week, not realizing the home was about to be closed through lack of funds. To see it whole one would have to follow Duvivier's camera through the empty corridors at night, with ghostly applause echoing everywhere—the echo of a hundred taunting dreams.Few films from abroad have been so wittily written (or so well translated by the dialogue scribes), and few films, whether from abroad or here, have so well interpreted the joys and sorrows of the stage. \\"Stage Door,\\" in the romantic, youthful vein, spoke perfectly of the actor's (and actress's) hopes. \\"The End of a Day\\" has added the other end of the mural. And, for its intervening section—the picture of the actor and the actress in the productive years of their life—we can suggest nothing better than the film itself, for it contains a panel of brilliant performances by some of the finest players on the contemporary screen.Michel Simon's Cabrissade is the most endearing, the most pathetic, the most obstreperous scamp we have seen since Will Fyffe was playing in \\"To the Victor.\\" M. Jouvet, M. Francen, Madeliene Ozeray, Gabrielle Dorziat—well, all of them are splendid.There have been other French films this season, but not until last night at the Filmarte was the season really hegun.

But this year, Fidelity Investments, for one, says it is opening Keoghs at a faster rate than last year. What's fueling the growth?  More owners of small businesses are getting into them, particularly since they are one of the few tax shelters left.    Given that, how should people invest their Keogh funds? Most investment advisers recommend putting a big chunk of retirement savings into stock funds, which tend to outperform fixed-rate investments over time.  Because most Keoghs are long-term investments, you can afford to be aggressive.

But though Mr. Dugan's itinerary takes in practically all the counties — Galway, Antrim, Kerry, Donegal and Mayo, to name some — it is a generally pretty but static trip.It is not always thus, however.

A former NC State senator, county commission chairman and town mayor, his career in the manufacture of socks, gloves, and abrasive equipment spanned most of the 20th century. Shuford, who maintained a residence in Manhattan, was a supporter of the performing arts in New York City. He was married to international concert pianist Dorothy Lewis-Griffith, who survives. A memorial service will be conducted Wednesday at 11 A.M. at Trinity United Church of Christ in Conover. A private interment was held today at Conover City Cemetery. Before his death Shuford had designated that memorials in his honor should be directed to Trinity United Church of Christ, 217 Second Avenue NE, Conover, NC 28613","excerpt":"The YMCA of Catawba Valley, PO Box 280, Conover, N.C. 28613; or Catawba College, 2300 West Innes Street, Salisbury, NC 28144. Shuford became a statewide figure of prominence in North Carolina while serving as a state senator. A life-long Democrat, he was elected to two terms in the Senate in the 1960's. During that period he was chairman of the Committee on Higher Education and helped spearhead the expansion of the University of North Carolina system. On Monday, NC Governor Jim Hunt issued a tribute to Shuford when he learned of his passing: ''I am sad to learn of the death of my friend Adrian Shuford. Senator Shuford was an exceptional leader of North Carolina and a true gentleman. Much of North Carolina's progress today in education and economic development has come because of his leadership in the state Senate. I am grateful for his life and extend my deepest sympathy to his family.'' Shuford served as mayor of Conover and as chairman of the Catawba County (NC) Board of Commissioners. At the time of his death he was trustee emeritus of Catawba College in Salisbury, NC. First elected to the Board of Trustees in 1944, he served as secretary of that board and was its chairman 26 years, from 1951 to 1977. Catawba College honored him with a Doctor of Humanitarian Service degree. In addition, the performing arts center on that campus was named from him and his wife. In his native community Shuford was honored in 1999 by the City of Conover by the establishment of the Adrian L. Shuford Jr. Conover Citizenship Award. He was cited for his contributions toward creation of the municipality's downtown park and town center. Shuford was the instigator of the founding of what is today the YMCA of Catawba Valley. He gave the property that is the site of the Adrian L. Shuford, Jr. YMCA Conover branch, established the endowment fund and was the first president of the YMCA. Educated at Cornell University and UNC-Chapel Hill, he returned to Conover in 1932 to become associated with the textile industry as president of Conover Knitting Mill and secretary of Warlong Glove Company, family businesses. Later he was a director of Riegel Textile Corporation and was a director of the Southern Hosiery Manufacturers Association and chairman of the National Association of Hosiery Manufacturers. While a young man Shuford was associated with Conover's first bank, Citizens Bank. He became president of Shuford National Bank and was a director of First National Bank of Catawba County and First Union. During World War II he was a Navy lieutenant, 1943-45. In 1959 he established Jackson Buff Corporation, which manufactured buffing and abrasive equipment, by buying several buffing equipment businesses around the country and moving them to Conover. The Rev. Dr. Arthur Caliandro of Marble Collegiate Church in New York City wrote Mrs. Shuford several weeks ago to inquire about her husband's health and declared: ''I have never met a more gentle, humble or sweeter human being. He is a very dear man, truly a beautiful soul.'' His first wife was the late Dorothy Cilley Shuford, who died in 1984. In addition to his second wife, he is survived by a son, Adrian L. Shuford, III of Newton, NC; a daughter, Dorothy Anna Shuford of Newton, NC; three sisters, Betty S. Yount of Winston-Salem, NC; Mary S. Palmer of Ann Arbor, MI; and Annie S.

Still, the decision to republish ''Jill'' is a worthy one.

Dmitry Kozak, the presidential representative to the Southern Federal District, provided the only good news: in the last two years the number of terrorist attacks has decreased by 33 percent. The 78 terrorist attacks that have occurred already this year, however, correspond to the 2005 level in the same period. Crime has increased by 10 percent in the region, according to the prosecutor general, and there are three times the number disciplinary infractions by the militia, the interior minister said.    PET LEGISLATION REVISITED: The tragic mauling death of a one-year-old child last week by a Staffordshire terrier has prompted the Moscow city Duma to dust off a bill, first proposed in 2003, to regulate household pets. Lawmakers, however, have been unable to set aside political ambitions to engage in productive debate on the legislation, the newspaper says. The opposition United Democrats, in a press conference on Thursday, blamed the United Russia party for stalling. Party members called for an end to canine anarchy with some proposing a ban on dangerous animals, while others supported taxing their owners. Aleksandr Kurt from United Russia, along with several canine breeders, opposed such harsh measures.    GAZETA    APATHY REIGNS SUPREME AMONG RUSSIAN ELECTORATE: A year and a half before parliamentary elections, more than half of Russias citizens, 51 percent, do not support any political party, according to the results of a survey by the Public Opinion Foundation. Aleksey Makarkin from the Center for Political Technology points to two reasons for the high level of political apathy: low trust in government generally and lack of information about political parties. Among politically inclined citizens, 25 percent support the United Russia party, 9 percent would vote for the Communist Party, followed by 7 percent for the nationalist Liberal Democratic Party. Liberal parties like Yabloko and the Union of Right Forces did not even register in the publics consciousness.    WHITE SUPREMACISTS SENTENCED: The sentencing phase of the trial of 12 members of the nationalist organizations, White Patrol and the Knight, who attacked four foreign students in Voronezh last October, killing 18-year-old Enrique Urtado from Peru, ended on Friday. The court sentenced Igor Pavlyuk, nicknamed Adolf, to 16 years in prison for murder. The rest, save one he was acquitted will serve between two and five years for their participation in the crime. Almost all of those charged with the crime are under 18 years old","excerpt":"the youngest is 15.    NOVYE IZVESTIA    MOST RUSSIANS STILL DISLIKE IMMIGRANTS: A poll by the prestigious Lavada Center conducted in early August found that 52 percent of Russians support restrictions on the influx of immigrants into the country, lower than the 59 percent who felt similarly last year. About 56 percent of those polled supports the idea of Russia for [ethnic] Russians, while 17 percent consider the slogan fascist. Nevertheless, the majority, 53 percent, agree the problem of xenophobia exists in Russia and that the number of fascists is rising. Valery Borshchev of the Moscow Helsinki Group blames the high level of distrust and hatred for immigrant groups on government propaganda.    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA    RUMORS OF COMPETITION AHEAD OF 2008 ELECTIONS: Russias defense minister, Sergei B. Ivanov, may head a party coalition that does not include United Russia, ahead of the 2008 presidential elections, a source told fontanka.ru. The source is reportedly a member of Za Rodinu, or for the motherland, a youth organization attached to Rodina, one of the coalition parties. Mr. Ivanov denied the rumor, calling it nonsense. A member of the Party of Life, also in the coalition, would not confirm the rumor either, but did say that in the philosophical sense, nothing is impossible. Rodina and the Party of Life have already agreed to unite in a coalition, and negotiations to include the Pensioners Party are underway.    JOURNALIST SENTENCED IN TURKMENISTAN: Ogulsapar Muradova, Radio Free Europe/Radio Libertys correspondent in Ashgabat, Turkmenistan, and two Helsinki Foundation human rights activists were sentenced to six to seven-year prison terms. Ms Muradova, Annakurban Amanklychev, and Sapardurdy Khajiev were found guilty of possession of weapons and explosive devices in closed court proceedings Friday. The three were involved in a film a French TV station was shooting in Turkmenistan. Reporters Without Borders, a media watchdog, said it was appalled by the attitude of the Turkmen authorities, who are flouting the basic rules of justice and human rights with impunity.    VEDOMOSTI    TELEVISION TAKEOVER: The German-Russian-owned television company, Ren TV, is set to buy out Petersburg TV, a St. Petersburg city-owned station which recently won the broadcast rights to 41 regions of Russia. Petersburg is to list $95 million worth of shares in favor of Ren TV. If Ren TV was to buy the entire package of shares, it would have a 75 percent stake in Petersburg. Ren TV controls 354 channels throughout the former Soviet Union. Its owners are the German RTL Group, who is the companys primary owner, and Severstal Group and Surgutneftegaz, who together control 35 percent.    RUSSIANS MAY BE FORCED TO TAX THEMSELVES: Five bills recently handed over to the Russian Duma will require local residents to pay for local projects. The bills sponsors in the Duma say municipal governments lack the resources to pay for local governmental needs, and see the answer in self-taxation. Residents of a village or neighborhood will decide whether or not to finance a project, and will be obligated to pay for it in the form of local self taxation. Development of previously untouched areas in the regions eats up most of the regional budget, so officials are seeking new financial sources, officials say.    IZVESTIA    CHANGES FOR MOSCOW SCHOOLCHILDRENMany Moscow schools will open Friday with new and improved technology improving the heath and safety of their students. Lunch buffets offering 18 varieties of salad, 15 different main dishes and 4 kinds of pizza give students a wider choice of food. They will pay for their lunch with virtual money, allowing them to manage their own money, while parents are able to keep track of grades and teacher reports via text messaging. Impenetrable fencing now surrounds many school grounds, and video surveillance and panic buttons offer increased safety measures against outside threats. These new features will be available in all of Moscows schools in a few years, officials say.

This show offers plenty of entertainment, as any show starring the incomparable tap artist, singer and actor Gregory Hines at the peak of his powers would have to. But George C. Wolfe, the musical's director and the author of its book, has used the biography of the jazz great Jelly Roll Morton as an occasion to dramatize larger issues of African-American identity and culture with passion and even rage, yet without ever forsaking the swift pacing, visual inventiveness and high theatrical style of musical theater at its American best. The choreography, by Hope Clarke, Ted L. Levy and Mr. Hines, is no less sizzling for making larger points about how black artists were betrayed by a variety of demons, not all of them white. The songs, which wed the music of Morton to additional music by Luther Henderson and the tough, bluesy lyrics of Susan Birkenhead, manage both to recapitulate the history of jazz and explain just what jazz meant and expressed to those who invented it. And the cast is overflowing with performers who act as ferociously as they sing and dance, among them Keith David, Tonya Pinkins, Stanley Wayne Mathis, Savion Glover, Mary Bond Davis and Ann Duquesnay.

This remorseless story of the self-destruction of a manipulative woman is an imperfect mixture of comedy, satire and psychological drama, with a touch of murder mystery thrown in, which critics did not much like when it opened in 1925. But it won a large audience then, especially -- and surprisingly -- among women, and a Pulitzer Prize. And occasional revivals prove it still durable.

White-bread Broadway gets a rare splash of salsa with the arrival of ''LATINOLOGUES,'' Brooklyn plays host to a troupe from Berlin, and in the East Village, LaMaMa presents a Polish meditation on the Oedipus complex. Bring your Berlitz guides.    Actually, fluency in Spanish is not required to enjoy ''Latinologues,'' a series of monologues about Latino life in America performed in English by a roster of established comics. CHEECH MARIN, who toked his way to fame with his partner Tommy Chong in the subversive comedy classic ''Up in Smoke,'' directs the Broadway premiere of this production. Opens Thursday at the Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200.    The DEUTSCHES THEATER BERLIN, which hasn't been seen in New York City in nearly a century -- the last visit was in 1916 -- returns with MICHAEL THALHEIMER's radical distillation of ''EMILIA GALOTTI,'' a 1772 tragedy by the German playwright Gotthold Ephraim Lessing. Mr. Thalheimer shrinks classics to their essence: this production takes 75 minutes. Opens Wednesday at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, Harvey Theater, 651 Fulton Street, Fort Greene, (718)636-4100.    In ''SAINT OEDIPUS,'' the director PIOTR TOMASZUK explores the famous Greek myth and its meanings in Western culture.

You probably won't get to see them anyway, unless you bought your tickets in utero, because their entire scheduled run, through April 2, is sold out. Let us instead mention their understudies, part of an exceptionally solid supporting cast assembled by a director whose name we'll also omit. Ready to step up from his usual role as Murray the cop if the man playing Oscar misses a performance (and if the theater is not burned down) is BRAD GARRETT, late of TV's ''Everybody Loves Raymond'' and the possible star of his own spinoff series next season. Mr. Garrett has cornered the market in dour. Preparing the arsenic for the man playing Felix is PETER FRECHETTE, whose distinguished résumé must list ''neurosis'' as a special skill. Mr. Frechette will normally be seen as Roy the accountant. Your best chance of catching them in the title roles would be if the show extends, or if you ask them nicely -- in a restaurant, say. Previews start Tuesday, Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212)307-4100.    Five restaurants make up the setting for ''FIVE COURSE LOVE,'' which, like most of the new off-Broadway musicals this fall, goes heavy on the pastiche. Here it's well done, with scenes and song styles amusingly matched: country-and-western in a greasy spoon, doo-wop in a diner, fake verismo in a red-sauce Italian. GREGG COFFIN (book, music, lyrics) cooked everything himself. Now in previews, Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212)307-4100.    As a journalist (among other things), perhaps ROGER ROSENBLATT is used to being paid by the word. How else explain the title of his new play (or ''almost a play,'' according to the script), ''ASHLEY MONTANA GOES ASHORE IN THE CAICOS  OR WHAT AM I DOING HERE?'' Alas, Mr. Rosenblatt leaves little room to say anything here about his existential vaudeville for a spooked intelligentsia -- complete with monologues, song parodies and blackout sketches -- except that it stars BEBE NEUWIRTH.

The most high-profile of these is ''FRAN'S BED'' (a Lifetime title if ever there was one), JAMES LAPINE's drama opening tonight at PLAYWRIGHTS HORIZONS, about a dying woman (played by MIA FARROW, no less) with a fractured family. 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212)279-4200.    But there is also the MCC production, opening Wednesday, of LAURA WADE's ''COLDER THAN HERE'' about -- hold on -- a dying woman, evidently a bit of a control freak, who is determined to organize her own funeral. JUDITH LIGHT (a Lifetime favorite) plays the departing perfectionist, and the impressive supporting cast includes BRIAN MURRAY, SARAH PAULSON (late of ''The Glass Menagerie'') and LILY RABE (late of ''Steel Magnolias''). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212)279-4200.    Raising the quota of domestic soap suds is DEBORAH GRIMBERG's ''CYCLING PAST THE MATTERHORN,'' in which the estimable SHIRLEY KNIGHT portrays a woman who has not only been left by her husband but is also going blind.

In ''BACH AT LEIPZIG,'' ITAMAR MOSES's comedy set in 18th-century Germany, a swarm of organists scheme and connive to secure a prestigious musical position at the leading church in Leipzig. PAM MacKINNON directs a celestial-sounding cast that includes RICHARD EASTON, JEFFREY CARLSON, MICHAEL EMERSON, BOYD GAINES, REG ROGERS and ANDREW WEEMS. Opens Monday at New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200.    Fast-forward a few centuries, lose the organ soundtrack and the laughs, add an unhappy ending and we're ready for ''RFK,'' opening the next night at the Culture Project, where politics and theater have made happy bedfellows in recent years. In this play written and performed by JACK HOLMES, a 1964 meeting with Lyndon B. Johnson over Robert F. Kennedy's potential inclusion on President Johnson's election ticket becomes the catalyst for a time-shifting examination of Kennedy's illustrious past and fateful future. The production is directed by LARRY MOSS, whose acclaimed staging of ''The Syringa Tree'' was a long-running Off Broadway hit several seasons ago. Opens Tuesday at the Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, East Village, (212) 307-4100.    History is recast in fictional terms in RINNE GROFF's play ''THE RUBY SUNRISE,'' which looks at a turning point in the development of a technology that would reshape world culture in the 20th century. In a barn outside Indianapolis, an ambitious young woman works to create the first ''all-electrical television system.'' A quarter-century later, her daughter, now working in a television studio in Manhattan, tries to ensure that her mother's pioneering work receives the credit it deserves. Ms. Groff's play was well received at its premiere at the Humana Festival of New American Plays in 2004 and represents OSKAR EUSTIS's first directorial effort since he took over as artistic director of the Public Theater this spring.

In ''SOUVENIR,'' JUDY KAYE (''Phantom of the Opera)'' plays the deluded woman whom critics called the ''dire diva of din.'' After a successful run off-Broadway, ''Souvenir'' was retooled for a stint at the Berkshire Theater Festival and now Broadway, replacing the lackluster actor who played the long-suffering accompanist with a more seasoned performer, DONALD CORREN. Previews start on Friday, Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200.    If you prefer inferior musicians to bad singers, check out ''BACH AT LEIPZIG,'' a comedy structured like a fugue about the contest to replace a prestigious organ master in Leipzig in 1722. Johann Sebastian Bach eventually got the job, but this play tells the story of the losers. Some out-of-town critics have already compared the playwright, 28-year-old ITAMAR MOSES, to Tom Stoppard. See for yourself. Previews start on Friday, New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212)239-6200.    While they may not be as well known as a certain odd couple or the murderous team on Fleet Street, the most exciting duo on Broadway this season could be the two lizards played by the brilliant ELIZABETH MARVEL, whose Hedda Gabler at New York Theater Workshop was ferocious, and FREDERICK WELLER, who was the coldblooded manager of the sales team in the recent Broadway revival of ''Glengarry Glen Ross.'' They star in a revival of ''SEASCAPE,'' Edward Albee's drama about a couple whose sunbathing is interrupted by voluble amphibians. In an old interview in this newspaper, Mr. Albee was asked if this situation seemed a bit far-fetched. No, he said, it's ''nearfetched.''

As Broadway awaits the revival of ''Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street,'' two new musicals opening tonight are venturing into the sorts of shadowy groves of anxiety where Stephen Sondheim has long made his artistic home.    ''SEE WHAT I WANNA SEE,'' at the PUBLIC THEATER, is the work of MICHAEL JOHN LACHIUSA (''The Wild Party''), one of the brightest students of Sondheimesque darkness. The show, which begins with a murder in Central Park, is inspired by short stories by RYUNOSUKE AKUTAGAWA, the Japanese fiction writer most famous for his perspective-shifting ''Rashomon.'' The cast notably includes the Tony-winning vocal powerhouse IDINA MENZEL (''Wicked, ''Rent'') and MARC KUDISCH, who has made a career out of knocking the stuffing out of his own matinee-idol handsomeness. 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212)239-6200.    On the same night, the TRANSPORT GROUP (which did itself proud by Mr. LaChiusa's ''First Lady Suite'' last year) is presenting ''NORMAL,'' whose title is no doubt ironic, at the CONNELLY THEATER, with a book by YVONNE ADRIAN, lyrics by CHERYL STERN and music by TOM KOCHAN. ''Normal'' paints a portrait of a happy family that loses its glow when one of its members succumbs to a possibly fatal eating disorder.

In next Sunday's episode, Holly Day (Jennifer Irwin), the villainous face of the American corporate sponsor (shudder!), reveals her plan to sell more tickets. Forget boring old Shakespeare: she is working on acquiring the rights to a musical about the life of John Lennon. ''I've already talked to Yoko,'' she says, giddily. In real life, her dream has come true, of course: ''LENNON,'' written and directed by Don Scardino -- who really did talk to Yoko Ono -- opens at the Broadhurst Theater today. The musical received less-than-enthusiastic reviews during its out-of-town run in San Francisco, but it has been retooled for the Broadway opening, which was recently postponed 10 days to allow more time to work out the kinks. Fans can expect familiar hits along with unreleased songs like ''India, India'' and ''I Don't Want to Lose You.'' Holly Day would be pleased. Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200.

The project, about lounge singers who save a cruise ship from hijackers (it was originally conceived as a satire of the Steven Seagal vehicle ''Under Siege''), was shelved after the Sept. 11 attacks. But its original screenwriter, the playwright DOUGLAS CARTER BEANE (''The Country Club''), has revived it -- sans Mr. Stone -- and added songs by DOUGLAS J.

Running at the Lion Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212)352-3101.    RICHARD GREENBERG typically aims higher (and reaches farther) than almost any other American playwright working on Broadway, so it's good news that he has three plays opening in New York this season.

Plans for this quixotic journey are announced by the estranged family misfit, a novelist, at the funeral of the clan's matriarch in Miami. Mr. Machado, in his second year as artistic director of the Intar Theater, dedicated to producing the work of Hispanic playwrights, opens the season with this world premiere. Previews begin Sept. 6 at the Kirk Theater on Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212)279-4200.    A dramatic announcement is also at the crux of W.

The idle, tennis-anyone happiness of a well-to-do British family is upended when Daddy has a particularly bad day at work. Worse still, he uses the occasion to question the course his life has taken.

For one thing, Ms. Rivera, 72, who starred in the original productions of ''West Side Story'' and ''Chicago,'' is not, as is the current fad these days, going solo. There will be an ensemble of 10 recreating classic choreography, and an elaborate production, staged by GRACIELA DANIELE, that brings back several old friends. Ms. Riveria will perform with a recording of Dick Van Dyke singing ''Put On a Happy Face'' and -- with the help of some clever lighting -- even pull off a duet with the late Gwen Verdon, who was the original Roxie Hart to Ms. Rivera's Velma Kelly. ''Chita Rivera,'' which is in previews now, opens on Dec. 11 at the Gerald Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200.    ''CELEBRATION,'' one of two one-acts written four decades apart by the Nobel Prize winner HAROLD PINTER, is a portrait of 1990's greed in which three couples have dinner at a fancy restaurant. ''ROOM,'' a brief sketch about a lower-class woman coming undone, was the first of his plays that Mr. Pinter saw performed in front of an audience. Mr. Pinter said that it was difficult to watch because, well, nature called. ''At the end,'' he told The Paris Review, ''I dashed out behind the bicycle shed.''

A time for considering the year gone by: the naughty and the nice, the good and the bad, the funny and the less so. The giggly events will be of particular interest at a faux awards show on Wednesday night at the UPRIGHT CITIZENS BRIGADE THEATER, the city's de facto town hall for alternative comedy. The second annual show, whose title is too racy for a family newspaper, is a summation of all things terrible about 2005, from pop culture to science to politics, with much comic riffing. Performed by a dozen or so of the brigade's regulars, the show is short (75 minutes) and sweet ($5). 8 p.m., 307 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 366-9176.    On the other end of the spectrum, there will no doubt be tears shed at the AL HIRSCHFELD THEATER on Saturday evening, and it won't just be because of the lack of taxicabs on Times Square. It's the end of the road for ''SWEET CHARITY,'' the $7.5 million Broadway revival that generated plenty of headlines but not enough sales. The production stars CHRISTINA APPLEGATE, who stayed with the show to the bitter end despite breaking a bone in her foot just weeks before opening in May. (She also recently announced that she and her husband had filed for divorce, but let's not dwell.)

The show, by the downtown provocateur KEN NINTZEL, has been playing only 10 days at P.S. 122 and ends on Friday. With a cast of dozens and several stories going on at once -- hence its title -- '' 'Twas'' is probably not for the traditionalist.

In that time Mr. Rylance and his company have established the Globe as a thriving artistic enterprise. But only New Yorkers who have seen the company at its home would know why: the troupe has traveled to New York only once, for a brief visit to the Brooklyn Academy of Music with a middling ''Cymbeline'' in 2002.    The company's absence has been a particular pity because the theater was the brainchild of the American actor SAM WANAMAKER, who died before the project was completed. Mr. Wanamaker would surely be pleased to know that the company returns to New York this week with a first-rate production of ''MEASURE FOR MEASURE'' at ST. ANN'S WAREHOUSE in Brooklyn. Under Mr. Rylance's stewardship, the company has specialized in simple but textually inquisitive productions that sometimes hew as closely to Elizabethan customs as possible, employing only male actors and featuring traditional music and costuming. ''Measure for Measure,'' directed by JOHN DOVE and starring Mr. Rylance as an unusually unprepossessing Duke Vincentio, is one of these ''original practices'' stagings. It's also a swan song of sorts for Mr. Rylance, who leaves his post at the end of the year, making this ''Measure for Measure'' a last chance for us to measure the quality of his achievement. Opens Thursday, 38 Water Street, at Dock Street, (718) 254-8779.    When ''MRS. WARREN'S PROFESSION'' opened on Broadway exactly a century ago, the cast was hauled before a judge on charges of ''disorderly conduct.'' It wasn't a comment on their acting ability but on the play's scandalous subject matter. Mrs. Kitty Warren, George Bernard Shaw's practical and independent-minded heroine, founded her fortune on prostitution. The IRISH REPERTORY THEATER celebrates the play's centenary with a new production starring DANA IVEY, the estimable actress who won a Tony nomination for a prior Shavian foray, in ''Heartbreak House.''

The second annual SUMMER PLAY FESTIVAL at Theater Row continues through the end of the month. The Fringe Festival is just around the corner. And beginning this week, the MIDTOWN INTERNATIONAL THEATER FESTIVAL takes over an otherwise unremarkable block of West 36th Street, presenting more than 50 productions in three weeks. There are not a lot of well-known -- or even vaguely known -- theater names on the roster, but, as is often the case with scrappy grab bags of work by mostly young artists, there are a lot of attention-getting concepts and titles. The festival will feature a musical about Gen X (it's called, wouldn't you know, ''APATHY'') and another about the doomed marriage of Charles and Diana. (Maybe that one should have been called ''Apathy,'' too.) My pick for Most Unpromising Title: ''CERVIX WITH A SMILE,'' described in press materials as ''hilarious and slightly disturbing.'' Just slightly? Runner-up: ''COSMOS/ETHOS: FROM BRIS TO ABYSS.'' There is also a play by ANNE FIZZARD titled ''GOOD OPINIONS,'' in which a coat-check girl is discovered to have a gift for predicting the responses of a theater critic from The New York Times. I hope she's well tipped. Begins performances on Monday at various stages on West 36th Street, (212)868-4444.    BRIAN FRIEL, the most significant Irish playwright of the last few decades, established his reputation with his 1964 comedy ''PHILADELPHIA, HERE I COME!'' When it opened on Broadway for a healthy run in 1966, produced by David Merrick, it introduced American audiences to a distinctive new voice from a country with a long and lively literary heritage. A touching comedy about a young Irishman preparing to leave home and hearth to seek his fortune in the city of the title, it illustrates the tensions in the heart and mind of the sensitive central character by presenting his public and private selves as separate beings, played by two actors. The IRISH REPERTORY THEATER's new production, directed by CIARAN O'REILLY, concludes the company's 2004-2005 season. Opens Thursday at the Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212)727-2737.

When Ms. May's new play, ''AFTER THE NIGHT AND THE MUSIC,'' opens at the BILTMORE THEATER on Wednesday, the celebrated comic duo will both be back on Broadway at the same time. Although they have largely pursued separate careers, Mr. Nichols and Ms. May began their long careers together, way back in the middle years of the last century, as performers of their own material. Since then, they have largely worked behind the scenes in movies and the theater. Mr. Nichols is, of course, the director of this season's monster-hit musical ''SPAMALOT.'' Ms. May's new production consists of three one-act plays about the absurdities of life and love in the new millennium. Although her record has been spotty in recent years -- her last play to be produced on Broadway, ''TALLER THAN A DWARF,'' was about as appealing as its title -- Ms. May has been manufacturing laughs for nearly a half-century now, and experience counts for a lot in comedy. Opens on Wednesday at the Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212)239-6200.    As you may have noticed, it has been a less than stellar season for TENNESSEE WILLIAMS on Broadway. Maybe the new, 50th-anniversary production of ''CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF'' at HARTFORD STAGE can restore a little faith in the enduring value of his greatest plays. On hand to celebrate the play's big birthday is ELIZABETH ASHLEY, the veteran actress who starred as Maggie the Cat in an acclaimed 1974 revival of ''Cat'' on Broadway. Ms. Ashley, who has subsequently become something of a specialist in Williams women, will undertake the role of Big Mama on this occasion, opposite WILLIAM BIFF MCGUIRE'S Big Daddy. ALYSSA BRESNAHAN and JAMES COLBY will play Maggie and Brick, the unhappily married couple tussling around that big bed. MICHAEL WILSON directs.

And they will all be on display in theaters this week, in a gamut of English-accented offerings that go from high tragedy on war-bloodied plains to crisp contemplations of marital infidelity in drawing rooms.    The Olympian VANESSA REDGRAVE, she of the towering talent and matching physique, stars in the ROYAL SHAKESPEARE COMPANY'S production of Euripides' ''HECUBA,'' at the BROOKLYN ACADEMY OF MUSIC, Friday through June 26. Previously seen in London and Washington, TONY HARRISON'S adaptation of this grim tale of the moral corruption bred by war suggests, not surprisingly, that what was true for Euripides is just as true today. In the title role of the Trojan queen made vengeful by defeat and degradation, Ms. Redgrave is said to remain dauntingly regal even in blood-spattered tatters. Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, (718)636-4100.    A quieter, droller mood of desperation pervades ''PRIVATE FEARS IN PUBLIC PLACES,'' the 67th -- yes, 67th -- play from the astonishingly prolific and consistently engaging ALAN AYCKBOURN, an underappreciated talent on these shores. His latest work, a layered story of six overlapping lives, is part of the Brits Off Broadway Festival at 59E59, where it opens on Tuesday. 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212)279-4200.    And KATE BURTON, a performer of rare subtlety and clarity, glides onto the domestic battlefields of ''THE CONSTANT WIFE,'' W. Somerset Maugham's comedy of all-concealing manners, directed by MARK BROKAW in a revival that opens at the AMERICAN AIRLINES THEATER on Thursday. Ms. Burton is principally known as an American actress, but she went Brit most convincingly on Broadway in ''The Elephant Man.'' Anyway, her father was Welsh.

The most blatant is ''RED, WHITE AND TUNA,'' the climactic chapter of the satirical Tuna Trilogy, which was perfecting blue-collar comedy before there was such a thing. For the unacquainted, ''GREATER TUNA'' was an off Broadway hit in 1982 that became a road show war horse (23 years and counting) and spawned a successful sequel, ''A TUNA CHRISTMAS.'' Each was set in mythical Tuna, Tex., a tiny little town where -- to quote the Greater Tuna Corporation's Web site -- ''the Lion's Club is too liberal and Patsy Cline never dies.'' The Tuna plays have made a mint for their apparently incorporated creators -- JOE SEARS, JASTON WILLIAMS and ED HOWARD -- earning more than $6 million a year on tour. As they did in the previous Tunas, Mr. Sears and Mr. Williams star in the final chapter, which lands in the nation's capital this week. Starts Friday at the Eisenhower Theater, the Kennedy Center, 2700 F Street N.W., (202)467-4600.    ''BIRDIE BLUE'' has nothing to do with the flag, but much to do with personal politics. The latest effort by CHERYL L. WEST (''Jar the Floor''), ''Blue'' stars S. EPATHA MERKERSON (of ''Law & Order'' fame) in the title role opposite BILLY PORTER, whose one-man show -- ''Ghetto Superstar'' -- caused a stir at the Public Theater in March. CHARLES WELDON completes the cast of ''Blue,'' a ''lyrical and jazzy'' look at one woman's life in black America. Opens Thursday at Second Stage, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212)246-4422.    And what could be more patriotic than an American company doing an Amerikan play? The AMERICAN REPERTORY THEATER, Boston's classics company, the THEATRE DE LA JEUNE LUNE (a new Tony Award winner) and MONTCLAIR STATE UNIVERSITY (in New Jersey) are producing ''AMERIKA, OR THE DISAPPEARANCE,'' based on Kafka's wild, unfinished novel.

The rosy fingers of dawn may still be undiscernible, but you may need to beat them to the Delacorte Theater in Central Park to snag tickets to ''MOTHER COURAGE AND HER CHILDREN.'' The production has been in previews for almost two weeks, but when the reviews hit the papers on Tuesday -- good, bad or indifferent -- the ticket vigils are likely to become still more, uh, vigilant.    The Public Theater's new production of this Bertolt Brecht antiwar masterwork is directed by GEORGE C. WOLFE and adapted by TONY KUSHNER. But the box office frenzy has obviously been ignited by the presence of MERYL STREEP in the title role.    In her storied career on film Ms. Streep has specialized in playing survivors. She was the damaged but enduring heroine in ''Sophie's Choice.'' She stared down the ravening Australian press to assert her innocence in ''A Cry in the Dark.'' She braved the elements, and bad guys, in the thriller ''The River Wild.'' And this summer she outfoxed enemies in the scheming media world without even raising her voice beyond a chilly purr in ''The Devil Wears Prada.''    Now watch as she endures all the horrors that the Thirty Years' War of the 17th century can throw at a woman. Mother Courage, exploiter and exploited in Brecht's bitter play about the futility of war, is one of the great emblematic characters of 20th-century theater. Ms. Streep's interpretation of the celebrated character should be well worth a few lost hours of sleep, either before or after it is witnessed. Set your alarms. Monday through Sept. 3. Free tickets available the day of performance beginning at 1 p.m. at the Delacorte or from 1 to 3 p.m. at the Public Theater box office, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village.

ERIC BOGOSIAN'S ''SUBURBIA,'' directed by his wife, JO BONNEY, opens off Broadway at the Second Stage Theater on Thursday, the same night that the ventriloquist JAY JOHNSON comes to Broadway with his longtime professional partner, a wisecracking wooden guy named BOB.    Ms. Bonney has directed many of Mr. Bogosian's monologues. But she has also proved to be an assured shaper of nifty ensemble work, notably the recent revival of Lanford Wilson's ''Fifth of July.'' ''SubUrbia,'' for those who missed the original production in 1994 and the Richard Linklater movie, focuses on nine disaffected youths hanging out outside a convenience store on a restless, aimless night. Mr. Bogosian has updated the text for the new production, setting it in the present. So the disgruntled youngsters no longer have to drop dimes in the pay phone to place a call. The promising cast includes KIERAN CULKIN, GABY HOFFMAN (of Wendy Wasserstein's ''Third'') and PETER SCANAVINO (''Shining City''). ''SubUrbia'' kicks off what could be construed as a comeback season for Mr. Bogosian. It will be followed this winter by a revival of ''Talk Radio'' on Broadway, starring Liev Schreiber. Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422.    Meanwhile a mere block away, at the Helen Hayes Theater, Mr. Johnson shares the stage with a former block of wood whittled into the smiling form of Bob, in ''Jay Johnson: The Two and Only.'' Mr. Johnson and his collaborator rose to fame in the 1970's sitcom ''Soap,'' and the aesthetic partnership has now lasted rather longer than the average American marriage. The show combines aspects of a club act with autobiography and a sort-of standup dissertation on the art of ventriloquism. It had a successful run off Broadway at the Atlantic Theater Company in 2004. 240 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200.

On Sept. 1 the NATIONAL THEATER in Britain colonized that middle ground when it started selling reproductions of artwork covering most of its history, from the 1964 Laurence Olivier-Maggie Smith ''Othello'' to ''Caroline, or Change,'' which opens there next month. The 650 posters available online at www.ntposters.org.uk include some famous images (the Cubist ''Equus'' horse) and some painterly delights (a diaphanous ''Blithe Spirit''), but what's most extraordinary is how workmanlike (in the good sense) they are. With their repeated typography and standardized formats, they might be circulars for fresh produce at a grocer's. They represent a culture of theatrical plenty.    While Olivier is unnamed and unrecognizable on that ''Othello'' poster, the economic climate of Broadway requires that, if possible, a named and recognizable star (or a helicopter) should dominate the visuals. But noncommercial theaters, which needn't make long-lasting brands out of their limited-run shows, can risk more evocative solutions. Among plays arriving in New York this fall, two stand out for the aptness and loveliness of their artwork.    For the Roundabout's ''Heartbreak House,'' now in previews, the illustrator Scott McKowen engraved a mansion adrift (or is it sinking?) in an oily ocean: Shaw's metaphor for England expanded to suggest a broader human fate. And for ''The Coast of Utopia,'' the Tom Stoppard trilogy playing from October through March at Lincoln Center Theater, Aivazovsky's 1850 shipwreck painting ''The Ninth Wave'' provides the perfect emblem for the folly of rationalism in the face of nature.    As it happens, the best seller at the National Web site depicts another Stoppard play: the 1976 ''Jumpers,'' featuring Diana Rigg. Is it too painful a contrast to note that the all-time champ at Manhattan's Triton Gallery, which has handled Broadway show posters since 1965, is ''Cats''?

Uptown, SARAH JONES's popular solo show ''BRIDGE & TUNNEL'' blasts into the big time when it opens at Broadway's HELEN HAYES THEATER on Thursday. The production's slow but steady journey north mirrors the hardened but hopeful attitude of many of its characters, a polyglot assortment of New Yorkers determined to make their mark on the world. A critical hit when it opened at the Culture Project about two years ago, it was expected to move to Broadway last season, but was derailed by another little show that could, ''The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee,'' which snapped up the theater it planned to move into. Undaunted, Ms. Jones and her personal melting pot simmered in silence for a time, and now re-emerge ready to share their voices with a wider audience. 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6262.    Meanwhile, RICHARD FOREMAN, a permanent fixture of the downtown theater scene for more than three decades, opens a new production at his regular stomping grounds, the ONTOLOGICAL-HYSTERIC THEATER at St. Mark's Church in the East Village. About a year ago, Mr. Foreman was ballyhooing his retirement from the illegitimate theater. When his last play opened, he announced that he was ready to take his quirky vision in a new direction, transferring it to celluloid. He's kept that promise, after a fashion. ''ZOMBOID!,'' his new show, is billed as a multimedia work incorporating film and live performance. Since Mr. Foreman's idiosyncratic aesthetic is nothing if not consistent, beginning with a fondness for titular exclamation points, admirers probably needn't fear that the move into a new medium means this resolute experimentalist has suddenly gone Hollywood.

NILO CRUZ, who won a Pulitzer Prize for ''Anna in the Tropics,'' is waxing poetic again in the lushly titled ''BEAUTY OF THE FATHER,'' which opens Tuesday at the Manhattan Theater Club. It's the story of a young woman who goes to Spain to find her long-estranged father and falls in love with a country. That Federico García Lorca, the archpoet (and archfatalist) of Spanish theater, shows up as a character and spiritual adviser should tell you something about Mr. Cruz's intentions. At City Center, Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212.    DOUGLAS CARTER BEANE, who emerged as a satirist of flair with ''As Bees in Honey Drown,'' returns to the infinitely skewerable topic of the culture of celebrity with ''THE LITTLE DOG LAUGHED,'' also opening Tuesday, at the Second Stage Theater.

The eternally purring kittycat EARTHA KITT makes a rare musical-theater appearance in the arrestingly titled ''MIMI LE DUCK.'' ANNIE GOLDEN, a specialist in daffy characters, plays a Mormon housewife from Idaho who tosses aside a career as a painter of ducks for a home shopping network (can't imagine why) to immerse herself in the perfume of Paris. Ms. Kitt plays a Parisian of similarly diverse interests. She's a chanteuse who also runs the boardinghouse that Ms. Golden's character moves into when she's ready to spread her wings.

Splatter-movie lovers who are also musical-theater devotees -- not a lot of crossover there, I suspect -- can have both tastes sated at ''EVIL DEAD: THE MUSICAL,'' which sets to music the grisly comic story from the cult horror movie (and its sequel) directed by SAM RAIMI.

But thin-skinned, Scrooge-minded theater addicts can still get their fix of greasepaint and misanthropy by hunkering down at home and watching rented vintage movies about backstage backstabbing. And, yes, it is possible to get beyond talking along with the epigrams in ''ALL ABOUT EVE'' (1950), the best movie ever made about Broadway behaving badly.    Consider, for example, two American films that drench Rialto glitter in the shadows of film noir: ''THE VELVET TOUCH'' (1948) and ''BLACK WIDOW'' (1954), which star, respectively, ROSALIND RUSSELL and GINGER ROGERS as leading ladies whose marquee-diva temperaments just might be lethal. (In ''Black Widow,'' gratifyingly enough, it's the ambitious Eve Harrington type, played by PEGGY ANN GARNER, who finds herself murdered.)    For those who like to fuel the wintertime blues with a stage star's wallow in the gutter, it would be hard to find better company than the great HELEN MORGAN, an immortal song stylist of the 1920s, rotting and weeping away in increasingly unglamorous burlesque dives in Rouben Mamoulian's fascinating ''APPLAUSE'' (1929), which frames showbiz tawdriness with German Expressionist angles.    And if you want a little politics thrown into the mix, there is always ''THE ENTERTAINER'' (1960), in which seedy seaside music halls become a prism through which you see the British Empire sinking. What makes Tony Richardson's adaptation of John Osborne's play essential viewing, though, is LAURENCE OLIVIER, in his greatest screen performance, as the dead-eyed vaudevillian Archie Rice.

Lindenhurst's Studio Theater's brave attempt to present ''The Lady from Dubuque'' by Edward Albee, a disciple of the ''absurdist'' school of playwriting, was, according to the theater's artistic director, Macey Levin, thwarted by Mr.  Albee's intention to stage a new version of either that play or ''Lolita,'' another of his recent failures.
