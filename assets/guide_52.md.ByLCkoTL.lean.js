Her versatile, intimate brand of entertainment is not unlike an act that you might have seen in the glory days of Las Vegas. She wistfully belts out a few songs, tells some cutting jokes about Hollywood and the fashion world and gossips about famous people as if they were your close, personal friends. In the right role, Ms. Bernhard, a mother who still looks sexy in a see-through dress (she is better preserved than Dick Clark), can be a decent actress, but she always seems most comfortable playing herself -- or at least the acid and soulful persona that passes for herself in her solo shows.

Major trading partners: exports: Germany, Pakistan; imports: Kenya, Belgium, U.S. Tutsi cattle-breeders came to Rwanda, in the late 15th century and slowly conquered the native Hutu farmers. The Tutsi established a monarchy, forcing the Hutus into serfdom. Germans were the first Europeans to arrive in Rwanda and declared it a protectorate in 1899. After World War I Belgium was given a League of Nations mandate over the territory, which became a U.N. trusteeship after World War II. Tutsi traditionalists resisted Belgian attempts in the 1950's to institute democratic institutions. In 1959 the Hutus revolted against the monarchy in a bloody conflict which led to a mass exodus of Tutsis. Two years later the Hutus won a U.N.-supervised referendum and were granted internal autonomy by Belgium on Jan. 1, 1962. Full independence came on July 1, 1962. Political unrest led to the overthrow of the government in 1973. Maj. Gen. Juvénal Habyarimana dissolved the National Assembly and banned all political activity. In 1990 Tutsi refugees in Uganda fought with the army, and by 1993 as many as one million people were displaced. A cease-fire and amnesty paved the way for political reform, and a new constitution allowing for multi-party democracy, separation of powers, and presidential term limits went into effect in June 1992. Proposals to merge the armies of the government (Hutu) and the Tutsi Rwandan Patriotic Front were signed in 1993. But in April 1994, the Hutu presidents of Rwanda and Burundi were both killed when rocket fire (perhaps launched by Hutu dissidents) shot down their plane as it returned from a peace conference in Tanzania. In renewed civil war, the Hutu dominated army of Rwanda and the Hutu militias were driven by the Tutsi-led Patriotic Front into Zaire, Tanzania, Uganda and Burundi; the Hutus reportedly slaughtered over 500,000 Tutsi and countless Hutu moderates as they went. The result was threefold: a million dead, three million refugees, and a Tutsi-dominated but multi-ethnic “government of national unity”. As the Mobutu regime collapsed in neighboring Zaire, the Zaire military attempted to expel a Tutsi community of 400,000 (the Banyamulenge people) who had been settled south of Lake Kivu since the 18th century. The Tutsi resistance gained support from the Rwandan government (Oct. 1996); thus commenced a de facto war between Rwanda and Zaire. The 500,000 Hutu militiamen and other refugees who, as a result, fled Zaire back to Rwanda joined another half million driven from Tanzania by the Tanzanian army. Yet another wave of killings by Hutu militants had begun in Rwanda. By 1999 the Hutu rebellion was petering out in small but vicious skirmishes and the government of Rwanda was continuing its military aid to insurgents in Congo while attacking Hutu bases in the eastern parts of that country, despite the July cease-fire. In April 2000, Paul Kagame was elected the first Tutsi president of Rwanda, and re-elected in 2003. Rwanda"},{"year":"2004","title":"GEOGRAPHY Location: eastern Hispaniola, in Caribbean Sea.

The Dominican Republic takes up the eastern two-thirds of the island of Hispaniola, which it shares with Haiti. Christopher Columbus visited the island in 1492, and Santo Domingo is the oldest continually inhabited European settlement in the Americas, with the oldest cathedral, hospital, and monastery in the Western Hemisphere. Western Hispaniola (Haiti) was ceded to France in 1697, and the eastern part of the island in 1795. Liberated with the Haitian slave revolts of 1801, it fell under Haitian rule from 1804 to 1808 (when it reverted to Spanish rule), and again from 1822 to 1844. It was again occupied by Spain from 1861 to 1865. Under Ulises Heureux (1882–99), the Dominican Republic enjoyed a period of independence and prosperity. The U.S. occupied the Dominican Republic between 1916 and 1924. In 1930 Rafael Trujillo set up a dictatorship lasting 31 years. Dominican political strife triggered another U.S. invasion (1965–66) to end the revolution. Reformist party candidate Joaquín Balaguer, president from 1966 to 1978, regained the presidency in 1986, was reelected in 1990, and again (at age 87) in 1994, but only for two years, a compromise arranged in the face of charges of election fraud. The 1996 elections resulted in a runoff between Haitian-born Jose Pena Gomez and Leonel Fernandez—both center-left in politics, both committed to economic privatization. Fernandez was the winner. But even the small and halting steps towards economic reform provoked strikes by labor unions and students over low wages, chronic water and electric outages. The death in May 1998 of Pena one week before legislative elections added a sentimental boost to real opposition. His Dominican Revolutionary Party captured large majorities in both the Senate and Chamber of Deputies. And in May 2000, for the first time, the party's candidate for president won, Hipolito Mejia.

The author lost both his parents to cancer in a span of 32 days, leaving him at 21 to raise his 8-year-old brother. After moving to California from the Midwest, the two embarked on a ''campaign of distraction'' that blended antic, slacker freedom with traditional parenting methods. His intensely self-conscious, often hilarious memoir, which was chosen by the editors of the Book Review as one of the best books of 2000, includes a new appendix correcting and updating the original. ''Eggers's real achievement is to provide a counterweight to what Ian Frazier once called 'the encroaching Hefty bag of death,' and to write about it, in our age of irony, with genuine, unsentimental poignancy,'' Sara Mosle wrote here.    The Jew of New York, by Ben Katchor. (Pantheon, $15.) This graphic novel revolves around a plan to create a refuge for Jews in upstate New York in 1830 and the fortunes of a disgraced kosher slaughterer who landed there briefly while wandering in the wilderness. ''Katchor has an extravagantly assemblagist imagination,'' J. Hoberman wrote here in 1999, and his ''strange and striking'' book is filled with spidery drawings and period artifacts.    In Search of Black America: Discovering the African-American Dream, by David J. Dent. (Touchstone/Simon & Schuster, $15.) A journalism professor, taking to the road to explore a handful of middle-class lives, reveals how broadly diverse and self-sufficient black America has become. Last year our reviewer, Michael E. Ross, praised the author's ''passionate, relentless curiosity'' and the depth of his reporting.    Make Believe, by Joanna Scott. (Back Bay/Little, Brown, $13.95.) Following the death of his father in a random shooting and his mother in a car accident, a mixed-race 3-year-old boy is thrust into the middle of a bitter custody battle between his two sets of grandparents. ''One cannot help urging anyone who loves writing'' to read this novel, Nick Hornby wrote here in 2000. ''There are occasions when the author's ingenuity and command of her craft make you want to laugh with pleasure.''    Grown Up All Wrong: 75 Great Rock and Pop Artists From Vaudeville to Techno, by Robert Christgau. (Harvard University, $18.95.) The senior music critic at The Village Voice employs critical academic theory and an anti-elitist perspective in these essays on acts as varied as B. B. King, the Beastie Boys and Lou Reed. ''He writes on each with equal erudition,'' Laura Jamison wrote here in 1998. ''The results are brilliant.'' In Flowers in the Dustbin: The Rise of Rock and Roll, 1947-1977, by James Miller (Fireside/Simon & Schuster, $15), a charter member of the rock intelligentsia traces the genre's development from its roots in postwar popular music through the rise of punk. ''He thinks harder and more broadly than most pop music writers, and writes more lucidly,'' Gerald Marzorati said here in 1999.    Round Ireland With a Fridge, by Tony Hawks. (Thomas Dunne/St. Martin's Griffin, $12.95.) The author, a British comedian, accepted a drunken &#163","excerpt":"100 bet that he couldn't hitchhike around the perimeter of Ireland with a refrigerator in one month's time. He quickly became a national celebrity, with locals turning out along the route to offer aid and sustenance. This account of his improbable quest is a ''ridiculous and sublime example of the high-concept travel book'' as well as a meditation on ''the astonishing good nature of the Irish,'' Karen Karbo wrote here in 2000.    Strange Travelers, by Gene Wolfe. (Orb/Tom Doherty, $14.95.) In these tales by a renowned science fiction writer, social inertia and the decay of tradition often pave the way for new beginnings. ''If there is a single point to stories so varied and skillful, it is that what happens is always less interesting than the people it happens to,'' Gerald Jonas wrote here last year. The Purple Cloud, by M. P. Shiel (University of Nebraska, $13.95), tells of a young doctor who returns alone from a polar expedition to find that a deadly purple vapor has poisoned the earth and left him the only man alive. The narrative is ''imaginative, fascinating, convincing, as some dreadful nightmare,'' the Book Review said in 1930.    Alfred and Guinevere, by James Schuyler. (New York Review, $12.95.) This slender 1958 novel by the esteemed American poet is a summer's tale about a brother and sister who are sent away to their grandparents' house in the country. ''There is much that is charming, accurate and often very funny'' in their adventures, Jane Cobb wrote in these pages. ''Schuyler has an excellent ear for young dialogue.''

His formal education ended in the fifth grade. As early as the 1920's, his performance contracts forbade him to use the back entrance to clubs and concert halls. Time magazine put him on its cover in 1949. He protested publicly when Gov. Orval E. Faubus blocked integration of the Little Rock schools in 1957, and President Dwight D. Eisenhower sent him a conciliatory telegram. Miles Davis said it was impossible to play anything on the trumpet that he hadn't already played.   The musician was Louis Armstrong, and today an archive that documents his extraordinary life will be dedicated at Queens College in Flushing. Scheduled to appear at the invitation-only event will be the trumpeters Dizzy Gillespie, Clark Terry, Doc Cheatham and Jon Faddis, as well as the tap-dancer Honi Coles, the pianist Marty Napoleon, the bass player Arvell Shaw and other jazz luminaries.  'A Prolific Diarist'    Armstrong, who died in 1971, lived in Queens for his last 28 years and is buried in Flushing. Among the thousands of artifacts in the Louis Armstrong Archive are the musician's collection of 8,000 photographs","excerpt":"100 scrapbooks and albums, many of which Armstrong assembled and decorated himself; thousands of pages of newspaper and magazine clippings; 20 files full of unpublished musical scores, and 240 acetate disks of live recordings Armstrong made at home.   There are also hundreds of pages of manuscript, much of it unpublished, written by Armstrong. \\"He was a prolific diarist, and he wrote a lifetime of reminiscences, observations and criticism,\\" said Michael Cogswell, the collection's curator. \\"Louis was a very public man, and this archive gives glimpses into his private life that have not been well documented.\\"    Also in the collection are Armstrong's library of 100 books on music and black history, many of which are autographed first editions.    There are also 500 reel-to-reel audio tapes containing performances, interviews, spoken reminiscences, and performance tapes, many of them not in existence elsewhere. Among them are performances in his own home, \\"where he'd play one of his songs on one tape recorder, then toot along with his horn, recording the duet on a second tape recorder,\\" said Dr. Shirley Strum Kenny, the president of Queens College, who was instrumental in bringing the archive to the school.    One of the more eccentric treasures of the archive is a book of bawdy jokes and stories that Armstrong compiled; among his sources were Bojangles Robinson, Stepin Fetchit, Zutty Singleton and Sid Catlett.  Playing Armstrong's Trumpets    Armstrong's five gold-plated performance trumpets are also among the artifacts in the collection, and they will be in use at the dedication celebration today by Mr. Cheatham, who is 86 years old and used to play with Armstrong; Mr. Gillespie, Mr. Faddis and Donald Byrd, as well as a trumpet student at the Aaron Copland School of Music at Queens College, and a 12-year-old trumpeter from Louis Armstrong Middle School in Queens.    It will take two to three years to arrange, preserve and catalogue the materials, during which time the collection will be unavailable to scholars. Ultimately, the archive will be open to researchers at the college and in a computer library data base.    \\"The collection is unusual in that it's suffused with the personality of Louis Armstrong,\\" said Dr. Kenny. \\"Beyond the autobiographical writings, he decorated his own scrapbooks with penned commentaries, and he was even his own archivist: he did cataloguing of his materials in his own hand.\\"    The Louis Armstrong Archive will be part of the technically advanced, climate-controlled Archival Center in the Benjamin S. Rosenthal Library at Queens College.    The archives come from Armstrong's modest frame bungalow with its red-brick facade at 34-56 107th Street in Corona, where he moved in 1943 with his fourth wife, Lucille. Despite his wealth in later years, he refused to move from the small house in the working-class neighborhood because it reminded him of the streets of his youth.    Lucille Armstrong died in 1983, and willed the house to the city of New York, and the Louis Armstrong Education Foundation donated his memorabilia to Queens College. The house, now landmarked by New York City, has been administered since 1987 by the college.    \\"When we examined the archives we discovered that they needed to be properly preserved in a climate-controlled environment,\\" said Dr. Kenny. \\"There were no temperature or humidity controls in the house itself.\\"    The archive has received a $50,000 grant from the Ford Foundation and a $30,000 grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities.    One less-than-crucial issue in Armstrong scholarship may not be resolved by the materials in the archive: unanimity on the trumpeter's proper nickname.

Its principles are canonical, but anti-purist (a couple of Depression-era Hawaiian guitarists make the grade, as do Jimi Hendrix and Carlos Santana), and its process strictly egalitarian: each of the 78 guitarists included makes only one appearance, with a recording identified as somehow emblematic. This policy creates some strange imbalances, although there's a refreshing justice in John Scofield, one of the set's producers, receiving the same track allotment as, say, the obscure swing player Otto (Coco) Heimel. A glossy and informative booklet, with several solo transcriptions, underscores the package's target audience.
