Even today's black pop, 40 or 50 years after the fact, owes much of its upward mobility to Cole.   The amount of his work alone warrants attention. This year three box sets have arrived.

In tone and attitude, if not in scope, the Berri enterprise begs comparison with Truffaut's great Antoine movies. But on every level and in every way, the comparison goes sadly against Claude Berri.Berri is usually cited as being like Truffaut, but more sentimental. In fact, he is no more sentimental (or, more accurately, no more committed to the primacy of sentiment) than Truffaut, but he is, at least on film, very much less intelligent. For Truffraut's sense of a morally cohesive, humanly relevant universe (a sense that makes \\"Stolen Kisses\\" a masterpiece, no matter what its warmth of feeling), Berri can offer only an anecdotal appreciation of experience. Typically, his films get whatever form they have from the shape of public events—the great wars of our time. But in the context of the films, those events mean nothing.In \\"The Man With Connections\\" the time is the mid-1950's, the war is in Algeria, and young Claude (Guy Bedos), an aspiring actor who meanwhile manufactures caps with his father and mother, faces conscription. His parents counsel courage, his mistress offers logic (one month with her has gone quickly","excerpt":"18 months in the army can only be one times 18) and a friend promises to pull strings. The strings give the film its title, and by that perverse fatality that guides the cutting of orders, they help move Claude from basic training outside Paris, to Morocco, to Algeria—where he spends much time in the guardhouse but never does see combat.As a service comedy, \\"The Man With Connections\\" is predictable but not unpleasing. The various portraits work well enough—especially Georges Geret as the French equivalent of a field first sergeant (\\"Don't play stupid with me. You may not win!\\") and Jean-Pierre Marielle as a Lieutenant Cassanova, who suavely courts Claude when he thinks that Claude's connections may win the outfit a visit from Brigitte Bardot.But a service comedy in the context of Algeria is a possible improbability, and Berri, who doesn't appear antiarmy or even antiwar, for that matter, ends his film with a wholly unearned irony that is supposed to connect with the larger terror behind every laugh the military mind can give you. Like all the other connections, this one, which opposes a kind of maniacal laughter to all the previous good humor, doesn't work, but to the embarrassment of the film rather than its main character.But even where it avoids embarrassment, \\"The Man With Connections\\" touches no major experience it does not belittle. For example, halfway through the film, Claude writes his mistress from North Africa to advise her not to wait for him because he is not ready to marry her. For just a moment we see the girl (Zorica Lozic) on her bed crying, and that is the last we see of her. The shot has the look of romantic economy—a look we (and surely Claude Berri) have come to value from the best of Truffaut and Jean Renoir. But whereas, in Renoir or Truffaut, that moment's pathos would relate to an order—romantic or not—that such economy might serve, in Berri it has no such relation because there is no order.

M - Michael Schmelling  Municipal Building, Chambers Street  A kiss is more than just a kiss for Suzanna Remedios and Hormoz Sabet, who have just exchanged wedding vows in a civil service at the marriage bureau.    M - Charles Harbutt  Fifth Avenue and 13th Street  Jamal Rahimi, a vendor from Afghanistan, serves up morning sustenance.    M - Merry Alpern West 12th Street    Q - Aaron Lee Fineman  Rikers Island  Badge No. 15053, aka Kelsey Bragg, keeps an eye on a photographer in Cellblock 1B at the city jail's James A. Thomas Center.    M - Tony Law  Broadway and Houston Street  A woman crossing Houston Street was hit by a car. After being administered to by paramedics, she walked away.    M - Elisabeth Bumiller City Hall  Elisabeth Bumiller, a reporter for The Times, covers Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.  The mayor's daily 8 a.m. staff meeting, in City Hall's Committee of the Whole Room, first used by Mayor DeWitt Clinton in 1812, is running late, the definition of any mayoral meeting of any century. The morning light coming in through the windows of the Federal-style room illuminates aides seated around a gleaming mahogany table, watching Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani listen to his commissioner of the administration for Children's Services, Nicholas Scoppetta.    Scoppetta briefs Giuliani about a rally the mayor will attend for directors of the city's foster-care agencies. When Scoppetta mentions a judge who is expected to be there, the mayor, perhaps aware that his New York minute is not yet riveting, or maybe that he is not yet the central character, makes a move.    ''Do I get my money for jury service?'' he breaks in, referring to his service as a juror days earlier in a personal-injury case.    Scoppetta, absorbed in his presentation, at first takes no notice. ''And he,'' Scoppetta continues, ''he will bring--''    ''A check?'' offers the mayor, to laughter.    ''A check,'' says Scoppetta jovially, catching on, just before the minute is over.    M - Chang-rae Lee Le Monde gourmet Deli, 38 West 48th Street  Chang-rae Lee is the author, most recently, of ''A Gesture Life,'' a novel.  Seung-lae Lee, the proprietor, my cousin, presides over his short-order cooks cracking eggs onto the griddle, two by two. ''Pretty busy this morning,'' he says. And so it is. In this get-to-work rush, the customers line the length of the front counter, each waiting for their breakfast sandwich or bagel to be wrapped in foil and passed over the gleaming glass case. They stand, watching the action, with an uncommon New York patience, for they know it'll be just another minute. Behind the counter, the people-machine is running in high gear, the orders taken and called out, the responses barked back, the talk flying forth in Spanglish and English and Koreanese. Lee's wife is directing it all, shouting, ''Yo, amigo,'' and ''Yes, ma'am,'' and ''Coffee, coffee, ha-rha-buh-gee [grandpa in Korean]?'' her addresses wholly indiscriminate and sweet. Somehow, everyone understands. The two cashier girls ring it up, making change in their heads, their hands moving at the light-speed of a dollar being spent in Manhattan. This is not virtual commerce. Lee knows this, and takes a few overflow orders himself, relaying them to the griddle men, who shout it out, starting the business all over again. ''Not bad today,'' Lee says, surveying his buzzing empire. ''It's working.''    B - Edwidge Danticat Utica Avenue and Avenue D, East Flatbush  Edwidge Danticat is the author of ''Breath, Eyes, Memory'' and, most recently, ''The Farming of Bones.''  Gray overcast minute in East Flatbush, a mostly African-American and Caribbean neighborhood. Landmark: Taste the Tropics Ice Cream, its parrot-green awning half covered with a swirling rainbow, linking three palmettos to a giant ice-cream cone. Car horns blare as ''dollar cab'' drivers race to get to the B46 bus stop to scoop up passengers before the bus arrives. For an even dollar each, the elderly caramel-skinned woman in a nursing uniform and the young boy in crisp navy pants, white long-sleeved shirt and a navy Catholic school tie will ride down Utica Avenue in a sleek leather-interior Lincoln Town Car and reach their destinations much faster. The Lincoln darts in and picks them up just in time, before the bus arrives.    The co-owner of a new custom-upholstery shop, Austin wishes he could be somewhere else. ''In bed, maybe?'' Or perhaps on one of those trips advertised on yellow cardboard in the window of Astral Travel, across from Taste the Tropics. For $388, one can journey to Trinidad, Grenada or Haiti; a trip to Senegal, on this day of nines, is fittingly priced at $999.    M - Susan Minot West Ninth Street  Susan Minot is the author of ''Monkeys'' and, most recently, ''Evening.''  In the lobby, a fan is going on the battered desk. No doorman. A sign: ''They are working on the Elevator. Is out of order.'' I step outside. Down the street is the building that served as a model (built in a Hollywood studio) for ''Rear Window,'' Hitchcock's ode to voyeurism. No one this morning looks at one another. A stocky woman in a suit bustles toward the subway, rooting around for something in her bag; an Indian couple walks dreamily arm in arm; a woman with hair still wet holds her chin high. A man in a blue shirt tends his dog. The clock on the brick tower of the library, which used to be a courthouse, says 9:09. Walking toward me with a brisk pace is the shrink I used to see some years ago, someone who has peered in the window of many people's dramas and imbroglios and minutiae, mine included. She walks quickly by, not meeting my eye.    1,022,827 gallons of water and 7,890 megawatts of electricity flowed into New York City. 135,000 phone calls were placed or answered.    M - Al Gibson, Mike Panarella and James Mennella  3 Times Square  Fifty workers constructing the new Reuters Building on Seventh Avenue between 42nd and 43rd Streets were given disposable cameras to record the minute. Gibson and Panarella are crane operators on the project.    Q - Leigh Holtzin the N Train, between Queensboro Plaza, Queens, and Lexington Avenue, Manhattan    Q - Jan Staller Queens, construction of a new Water Tunnel    M - Marilyn Church 100 Centre Street  Judge Carol Edmead of Arraignment Court speaking with Michael Borba, the bridge officer who hands her the arraignments.    M - Ken Kerbs New York Stock Exchange    M - Grand and Forsyth Streets (left), broadway and wall street (right) Anthropology students from Barnard and Columbia collected garbage that was deposited in trash receptacles during the minute.    M - James Traub The United Nations  James Traub is a contributing writer for The Times Magazine.  Kofi Annan, secretary general of the United Nations, left an elevator with his bodyguard and entered a television studio where he was scheduled to tape two messages -- one to ''the world business community,'' the other to employees of Unesco, a U.N. agency. Annan, who had been preoccupied for weeks with the conflict in East Timor, sat down before a mirror to be made up. He was as still as a mannequin, and he wore the muted uniform of the institution man: navy suit, white shirt, red and blue tie. Annan's white hair and goatee made his large, sleepy eyes look impossibly black. When an aide stuck his head through the curtain and said sorrowfully, ''There is a problem with the teleprompter, sir,'' Annan remained expressionless for a moment and then said softly: ''I'll do it another time. Now I can go talk to East Timor.''    B - Nicholas Dawidoff Yankee Stadium  Nicholas Dawidoff is the author of ''The Catcher Was a Spy,'' a biography of Moe Berg, and ''In the Country of Country.''  Thomas Fyfe headed for the batter's box at Yankee Stadium. He carried a rake. Fyfe works as a groundskeeper at the most famous baseball field in America, and at 9:09 a.m. he stood alone on the vast green lawn surrounded by 57,746 empty seats, tamping and prodding the muddy clay around home plate. Pausing for a moment, Fyfe looked out across the dew-soaked outfield and noticed things only a groundskeeper sees.     In right field, a sea-gull feather lay on a tired stretch of sod that Fyfe refers to as ''O'Neill's spot'' -- a patch of grass the outfielder Paul O'Neill wears down with his vigorous pacing between pitches. An open gate in left-center revealed two tomatoes heavy on the vine in the bullpen garden. In shallow-left, near the stands, were two ballpoint pens, misplaced, Fyfe thought, by fans hoping to receive an autograph. ''Now's the best time in the world,'' he said. ''There's nobody here. You just come out and work.''    M - Cathleen Schine 76th and West End Avenue  Cathleen Schine is the author, most recently, of ''The Evolution of Jane.''  In ''The Pursuit of the Millennium,'' the historian Norman Cohn illustrates the five ways in which medieval millennialists identified salvation.     1. It will be collective.    We're here, together, waiting for the same thing. . . .     2. It will be realized on this earth.    Grinding din of workmen digging up street, heaviness of humidity. . . .     3. It is imminent.    Man on cell phone, hand held out with casual certainty. . . . Two women, both in black suits, competitors, eye each other, ready to pounce. . . .     4. It will be total -- utterly transforming life.    An undeniable truth in heavy rain. Or when it's freezing and you're not properly dressed. Or when you're late. Like increasingly frantic father with son's backpack. Mother, with squirming daughter, waving wildly. . . .     5. Finally, it will be miraculous.    Yes. Only one of blind mystical faith like the man with the cell phone, hand still out, can really expect one now. The others peer irritably into the distance. Lights atop yellow cabs unlighted -- inauspicious.     But then. . . . A golden gypsy slows, sparkles beside the believer, blinks its headlights. . . . Just one. . . . The left. . . . It's a sign!    It's a taxi.    M - Eleanor Randolph Astor Place  Eleanor Randolph is a member of the editorial board of The Times.  Jerry DeLakas stands alone in his compact green newsstand, surrounded by a panorama of urgent headlines. ''Virus Scare Grows'' shouts Page 1 of The Daily News -- mosquitoes have caused an outbreak of ''encephalitis,'' three deaths in a city of seven million people. Newsday features a postman with bug spray in his mailbag. The stand is oddly quiet. DeLakas smokes, a hazard made worse by his habit of storing his burning cigarette in the middle of a stack of magazines while he makes a sale. Suddenly a man in overalls rushes up, pays for a copy of the Spanish daily El Diario and then begins running back to the street. ''My truck stop there,'' he points to the reason for his urgency. ''No make me get ticket,'' he calls over his shoulder. With 10 seconds left in the minute, a lean man darts into the newsstand, grabs The New York Times, The New York Post and The Wall Street Journal and leaves a small wad of bills. Engrossed in his cell phone, he waves off the change, a far bigger deal clearly hanging in the balance. Only once does he slow down -- to explain to me that he cannot stop.    A sampling of the books returned to the Brooklyn Public Library in Grand Army Plaza: E.B. White, ''Charlotte's Web''; James Herbert, ''Portent''; David Eddings, ''Sorceress of Darshiva: Book Four of the Malloreon''; Amanda Quick, ''Reckless''; Wanda Ga'g, ''Millions of Cats.''    M - Alex Witchel Grand Central Terminal  Alex Witchel reports on style for The Times.  Her flowered skirt sways above her ankles, like curtains in a breeze. She makes her way intently around the circular beacon that is the Information Booth in Grand Central Terminal, oblivious to the streams of men charging off the escalators, wielding briefcases big and battered. She walks first past the red schedules, the green, then the blue, selecting one of each -- Westport, Greenwich, Tuckahoe -- as if she were choosing fruit.    She passes through the line of harried questioners (''Can you tell me how to go to Metuchen, N.J.?'') and drifts past the man who sets his coffee cup on the shelf holding the schedules, knocking some to the floor, where they lie, ignored.    Her journey complete, she files her stack carefully in her black shoulder bag. Knowing now how to get to every New York suburb at every hour of the day, she turns her back and heads toward the subway.    B - Charles Siebert Brooklyn Bridge  Charles Siebert is the author of the forthcoming ''Angus,'' a memoir of a dying dog.  At the top of the Brooklyn anchorage ramp, a well-heeled woman stops to wrestle a homeless man over the trash can he has just spilled onto the promenade, thrashes him with her briefcase, picks up scattered newspapers and puts them back in the container as he canes his way toward the next one.    Nearly 10 minutes gone of the official workday, these are the late crossers. No eased faces in the mounting heat, all grimace and climb, traffic so dense you worry for its destination, start counting the city's vertical panes against the passing eyes and windshields here, some incalculable yet daily resolved equation between the onslaught and the eventual settle. The sun slides into view. From unseen roadway scaffoldings below, jackhammers and lug wrench whines, the nuts and bolts, the underpinnings of flight being tended to.    M - Joan Liftin Washington Square Park    B - Erin Patrice O'Brien Beth Jacob School, Boro Park, Brooklyn    M - James Mennella 43rd Street and Seventh Avenue    M - Timothy (Speed) Levitch Sixth Avenue and Eighth Street    M - Benjamin H. Lee Washington Street, off 14th Street    B - Alex Tehrani Third Avenue and 149th street, The Bronx    B - Brenda Ann Kenneally Broadway and Kosciuszko Street, Bushwick, Brooklyn    M - Amanda Hesser Wall and Water Streets    M - Arlene Gottfried Sixth Avenue and 12th Street    M - David Shipley Greenwich Avenue and 10th Street    B - John Berendt Green-Wood Cemetery, Brooklyn  John Berendt is the author of ''Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil.''  Except for the distant drone of a lawn mower and the higher-pitched whapping sound of an edge trimmer somewhere out of sight, all is stillness on this grassy hilltop in New York's ''Garden City of the Dead.''    In the shadow of an imposing bronze statue of Minerva, Charles Higgins, the inventor of India ink, slumbers in a heavy, banklike mausoleum. Some yards behind him, the remains of the musician Leonard Bernstein lie under a simple marker set flush into the ground. Five small stones have been placed on it.    Half a million people are buried in this cemetery, and five more are lowered into it every day. They tell me that 135 groundskeepers maintain these 478 lush acres, but all I know is not a single living soul came into view during the minute I stood watch.    Esmeralda Santiago Southbound tollbooth plaza, Henry Hudson Bridge  Esmeralda Santiago is the author of ''When I Was Puerto Rican'' and, most recently, ''Almost a Woman.''  A Dodge Intrepid cuts in front of a Lexus. The Lexus driver curses and gives the finger to the Intrepid, which then weaves in front of an Eclipse. An Explorer sidles up to a Beetle, hovers next to it until its driver notices, then signals right. A Navigator balks between the Cash Only and E-ZPass lanes, blocking everyone behind. A Pathfinder noses the Navigator, which stops dead in its tracks. A yellow cab takes advantage of the Navigator's hesitation and guns in front of it, followed by a Caravan. An Expedition tries to make the same move, but the Navigator lurches forward, heading, finally, triumphantly, for the E-ZPass.    One arrival at Newark International Airport (US Airways Flight 1122, from Pittsburgh) and one departure (Continental Flight 1083, to West Palm Beach, Fla.). One departure at La Guardia (United Airlines Flight 347, to Denver). No arrivals or departures at John F. Kennedy International.    B - Harvey Shapiro Brooklyn Promenade  Harvey Shapiro is the author, most recently, of ''Selected Poems.''  There they are  the water-hugging giants of Manhattan  breathing the dun-colored air of morning.  Silent, mysterious  seen through a white scrim of fog.    Directly beneath me, commuter traffic  of the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway.  Across that, on the Brooklyn docks  one lone forklift tractor, loaded with steel rods,  jockeying back and forth  before the Strober Bros. Building Supply Depot.  Across the water, dimly descried,  nested in the green arches of Battery,  a perky yellow Staten Island Ferry.    But the buildings pulsing in their various  shades of white  and now, as the fog thins slowly,  a pale dusty blue, out of Giotto,  seems to descend behind them.    These mighty presences at the end of  Manhattan Island,  fronting the East River that is not a river  but a tidal strait carrying  the North Atlantic to our very doorstep.    These monuments that dominate our day  as if they had been fixed there forever  though they are in flux as the waters are in flux.    They stand before us  like tribal gods meting out success and unsuccess,  all that we have to lift our eyes to.    M - Pete Hamill Broadway and Canal Street  Pete Hamill, former editor of The Daily News, is the author, most recently, of an illustrated biography of Diego Rivera.  At 9:09, the street light changes and trucks roar into life along Canal, crossing Broadway, heading east to the Manhattan Bridge, west to the Holland Tunnel: gru, gru, grug, gu-grug, groooaaaaar. Pedestrians rush across Broadway: two Chinese girls in high heels speaking English; a tan woman with a dragon tattooed on her bare back, sipping coffee as she walks; a fat guy in a Ralph Lauren shirt hurrying across on dainty feet right behind four students with backpacks and baggy jeans. All easing past one another, avoiding collisions, hurrying. A young Latina woman, copper-haired in the morning sun, wearing a tailored tan suit and carrying a briefcase, strides through the jumbled crowd, cutting a path. A large woman in a blue dress pauses to light a cigarette, her face desperate and sweaty, while others move around her. A tiny gray-haired Chinese woman in slacks and blouse, carrying a heavy shopping bag, hurries along, as the light turns to DONT WALK and a Bell Atlantic truck makes an abrupt turn out of Canal, heading directly at her. She freezes in the truck's path. The driver stops, gives her a small wave; she nods and waves back and hurries on, into her American morning.    M - Jack Pierson Churchill Park, Bleecker and Downing Streets    B - Yvette M. Sohl Central Avenue, Bushwick, Brooklyn    M - Nina Berman Central Park West and 81st Street  Madeline Greenberg, in her apartment, gets some help from her nurse, Judy Dennis.    B - Angel Franco Viele and Tiffany Avenues, Hunts Point, The South Bronx  Roxxanne, a 27-year-old prostitute, in front of the lot where she lives. Originally from Maine, she came to New York 12 years ago.    M - Carrie Boretz  P.S. 165, West 109th Street  Genesis Frias is not at all happy about returning to school. Struggling all the way, she is led into her first day of second grade.    M - Julia Topolski  West Ninth Street, between Broadway and University Place    M - Lewis Lapham The Carlyle Hotel dining room, Madison Avenue at 76th Street  Lewis Lapham is the editor of Harper's Magazine and the author, most recently, of ''Lapham's Rules of Influence.''  A high-ceilinged room decorated with the reassuring signs of serious money: English hunting scenes by Fores on walls faced with brown velvet, fresh flowers (Casablanca lilies and curly willow) against a background of old botany (the engravings by Redoute), the pattern of the breakfast china matched to the chintz on the center banquette, the coffee priced at $5, the poached eggs on smoked salmon at $22.50. The 28 tables accommodate a tasteful selection of fine guests, as reassuring as the decor in their dress and appearance: custom-made shirts, German accents, warm suntans lately arrived from Cape Cod and California, a small but important collection of gold jewelry. The two men rising from the table near the door -- Robert Rubin, recently resigned as the secretary of the Treasury, and Richard Holbrooke, newly confirmed as the ambassador to the United Nations -- gather their papers and close their briefcases. They nod to people in remote corners of the room, and as they walk out into the lobby, the matre d'htel bows to them with a grateful smile, acknowledging their fitness to be seen in the company of horses by Fores, watches from Breguet, the lily by Redoute.    Frank McCourt 345 East 15th Street  Frank McCourt is the author, most recently, of '''Tis.''  It is the first day of the academic year for the High School for Health Professions and Human Services. This is where I used to teach, from 1969 to 1987, back when Stuyvesant High School was in this building.    Students crowd the sidewalks between First and Second Avenues. They sit on the steps of the old brownstones opposite their school. They also lean against cars, triggering alarms, which they then imitate. They laugh till security guards or other adults from the school ask them to please stay off the cars. The students are polite, but when the adults go back into the building, they relax against the cars again.    Along the street, there are reunions, cries and hugs. Hi, Joey. Hi, Miranda. Wow, you lost weight. Love your hair.    The student population seems to be largely African-American, with smaller groups of Hispanics and Asians and an even smaller group of whites. When I taught here, the population was mostly Jewish, though as the years went on it became increasingly Asian. The school bell rings, and the boxes, bags and bottles containing foods and drinks must be disposed of. Adults from the school ask the students to please pick up their garbage and put it in the can, but there is litter and the school year has begun.    Zero births and deaths reported in New York City. 7,420,166 estimated population.    S - Bastienne Schmidt New Brighton, Staten Island  It's breakfast time for Philippe Cheng and his 6-month-old son, Max.    M - Garry Trudeau Fifth Avenue and 84th Street    The Alignment of The Heavens www.astrology.net    B - Deborah Mesa-Pelly Remsen Street, Brooklyn Heights    B - Phillip Lopate Carroll Park, Brooklyn  Phillip Lopate is the editor of ''The Art of the Essay,'' an annual anthology.  Four hefty Italian-American moms sit around the picnic benches, drinking iced espressos while their kids dash around. A father, middle-aged like me (Oh, the sticky solicitous doting of graybeard dads!), tenderly picks up his boy to take him to the bathroom in the dignified stone park house. Another father lifts his tan-frocked daughter up to grab the parallel bars, then says, ''Play with something else,'' and heads for a bench. He's teaching her ''independence,'' meanwhile grabbing a few private moments. She skulks over the standard-issue climbing structure, probably thinking, Why do adults insist on pretending it's fun to play by yourself?     This park is the glue that holds our (suddenly trendy) neighborhood together, the one public space that equalizes newcomers and old-timers, haves and have-nots. In their corner, black nannies with white babies discuss in island accents the chances of finding other employment. Across, a woman trains her son to take toddler steps, while absent-mindedly picking lint from her yellow blouse. A huge-bellied man snoozes on a bench, his shopping cart filled with collected bottles.    Excerpts from the Dow Jones news ticker, Times Square: TOKYO STOCKS CLOSE 0.2% HIGHER AFTER JAPAN'S G.D.P.

Homes Crunch gym, 404 Lafayette Street  A.M. Homes is the author of ''Music for Torching,''a novel.  In front of me are hindquarters -- three women on StairMasters, pushing to the top. To my left, a famous foreign correspondent, on a Precor EFX544 Crosstrainer. He reads papers damp with sweat, turning the pages and then shedding them to the floor, leaving a pile of news all around him. On the treadmill next to me, a gray-haired guy, cell phone clipped to his shorts. He runs at 5.8 m.p.h., panting. His phone rings. ''I don't know,'' he barks. ''I don't know anything.''    At the juice bar, someone orders a Chocolate Monkey with soy protein. Overhead hangs a bank of TV's, close-captioned for the hearing impaired. On the exercise channel, a group of 20 does tricep exercises in unison. The CNBC ticker tape flows while Martha Stewart's mother suggests adding pineapple to the rice pudding; Martha, justifiably suspicious, offers that maybe raisins would be more traditional.    A commercial for Final Fantasy IV flashes across the screen, and the gray-haired guy is ringing again. ''Are we winning?'' he asks, splashing sweat onto my controls. ''That's all I want to know, are we winning?''    M - Darcy Frey WEST 72nd Street  Darcy Frey is the author of ''The Last Shot.''  Location: Small, well-appointed office, decorated with sprawling vines and South American artifacts, in an apartment building. Two men face each other in leather armchairs. On an ottoman between them sits a tape recorder.  Patient: Last night, I had all sorts of performance-anxiety dreams.  Analyst: Such as?  Patient: Well, I dreamt I was in some sort of stage production and I couldn't remember any of my lines.  Analyst: Yes?  Patient: And the woman I was doing the scene with, she couldn't remember any of her lines, either. [Through the open window comes the squeal of truck brakes.] To be honest, I think it's about my doubts and anxieties about being in therapy.  Analyst: Let's stay with the dream for a moment. Where does the dream take place?  Patient: I can't remember.  Analyst: And the woman -- who was she? [The piercing cry of a car alarm is heard.]  Patient: I can't remember.  Analyst: Well, what did she look like?  Patient: I can't remember.  Analyst: Well, was she someone you were romantically involved with? [A jackhammer starts up. Analyst and patient raise their voices.]  Patient: No, she was someone I'd been paired with artificially.  Analyst: And why do you think this is about therapy?  Patient: Well, talk about an artificial situation!    M - Michael Pollan Central Park  Michael Pollan is a contributing writer for the magazine.  ''It's hideous out there,'' warned the radio. ''Hazy, hot and humid'' was the forecast, and by 9:09 it was already all of that. But hideous? Not where I was.    Where I was was on the terrace of Belvedere Castle, the rough midpoint and actual high point of Central Park, and the precise spot where New York City's weather is measured by an ensemble of meteorological instruments. At 9:09, the official readings were as follows: temperature, 24 C; dew point, 22 C; relative humidity, 87 percent; visibility, 1 1/2 miles in mist; barometric pressure, 29.87.    Here are some other, unofficial readings as of 9:09, collected by five different instruments temporarily installed at the same location:    Eyes: Looking north over the Great Lawn, a milky haze hangs in the trees, throwing the blocky crenelations edging the park slightly out of focus. The effect is like standing at the bottom of a large white teacup, the haze curving up the sides to an indistinct rim circling above; only directly overhead is the pale blue of the sky visible. Below, five mallards moving east etch overlapping V's in the green pane of Turtle Pond. Eight turtles nap on a narrow ledge of schist, all presenting themselves to the sun at precisely the same angle. Across the pond, six stagehands are striking the set at the Delacorte Theater. A woman in a Sullivan & Cromwell T-shirt Rollerblades along the perimeter of the Great Lawn, which is being mowed. A belated wisteria bloom, one of summer's (and millennium's) last, hangs in the crown of a cherry tree.    Skin: Right cheek registers an intense circle of radiant heat originating at the 2 o'clock position in the eastern sky.     Tongue: Tang of salt, from the perspiration beading upper lip.    Ears: The drone of traffic across the 79th Street transverse, steady as an air-conditioner until broken by the diesel laboring of a crosstown bus. A jet rising from La Guardia slowly churns the air, then fades, opening a parenthesis for the warble of a bird. Echo-y hammer taps rise from the stagehands, who have switched on a boom box or radio: jazz.     Nose: The moist, unmoving air holds each smell in a kind of suspension. There is cut grass; there is decadent pond; there is dumpster; there is hot-dog steam.    M - Jhumpa Lahiri Cooper Station Post Office, Fourth Avenue and 11th Street  Jhumpa Lahiri is the author of ''Interpreter of Maladies,'' a collection of short stories.  A man affixes 33-cent stamps to a pile of purple envelopes. The envelopes are stiff, full of promise, elegantly addressed in bold black strokes. The stamps, self-adhesive, have pink roses on them. The man wears a plaid shirt, khaki shorts, brown shoes and black socks pulled up to his calves. He stands at a table, covered with pale green glass, supported by golden columns. A brass plate runs down the center of the table, with empty round receptacles where there once may have been sponges for moistening stamps. Voices echo in the post office. Heels clip across the floor. The man works solemnly, methodically, about to see a long project to its end. Above his head, a digital clock.Time is running out to the year 2000,'' the clock's backing says: 113 days, 14 hours, 50 minutes, a few seconds to go.    M - Gosia Wieruszewska 158th Street and Broadway    M - Four Seasons Restaurant East 52nd Street  The reservation list for the day's power lunches to come.    M - Scott Thode  125th Street and  Lexington Avenue  A construction site turned community bulletin board.    M - Michael Hsu 35 Pell Street  John Hung: This is my business, the May May Company, and we're making right now a baked pork bun -- a sweet roll filled with the barbecued pork and oyster gravy. I would imagine 1,000 years from now it'll be automatic, making the dough and getting the fillings ready. Everything will be the same size, same way, identical. Handmade you can tell the difference: some are rounder; some are fatter; some have a little more filling. Anything done by machine has no feeling.    Public Radio's Sound Portraits Productions (David Isay, Stacy Abramson and Meagan Howell) sent reporters out to record the minute in eight places around the city. Here are excerpts; more recordings can be heard at www.nytimes.com/nyminute.    M - Richard Sandler Jones Diner, 371 Lafayette Street  The Rev. Billy, left, sidewalk preacher: A thousand years from now we will not be measuring our lives by our time-distance from the birth of one Jesus Christ. We will be measuring our time from the birth of Mr. Mickey Mouse. Mickey is the most famous corporate logo in the world, and his power over us is accelerating at the present time. We must resist this. How do we do that? Right now we don't have a clear strategy. Right now, Mickey Mouse and his handlers are in the ascendancy. . . . I have a vision . . . of erasing Mickey Mouse's face. Nothing is left of it. Times Square again becomes a place where the sidewalks are populated by real people! Visionaries. Sex workers. Blarney Stone experiencers. People sagging in the doorways. Hallelujah. That's the future! Amen! Praise be! I'm going to get back to my Western omelet right now. Nice to talk to you.    M - Beth Fertig Manhattan Criminal Court  Mr. Black [he wouldn't give full name]: Nineteen-ninety-nine is the beginning of the end. Everything is getting worse. Anyone selling drugs gets football number -- 55 years, lifetime sentences. Cocaine or weed. I'm here for selling weed, they say. I didn't put a gun to anyone's head. I'm just trying to feed my kids.    M - Verlyn Klinkenborg 38th Street and Sixth Avenue  Verlyn Klinkenborg writes editorials for The Times. He is the author of ''Making Hay'' and ''The Last Fine Time.''  What does this lot lack that makes it ''vacant''? Tenants larger than the 13 pigeons resting there. Foliage more ornamental than the low weeds growing in a solid mat near the 38th Street sidewalk. Dwellings more substantial than the construction trailer parked beside a sign announcing ''Another Gotham Construction Project.'' Commerce more consequential than the sticker pasted to a fence post advertising a Millennium Marijuana March in May 2000. Will the march take place? Will construction begin? Will the pigeons fly? Nothing happens here except time and the roosting of pigeons. And yet the sound of the street -- an overcast roar -- is subtly changed by the cubic absence, the nearly inaudible silence this vacant lot offers the city.

In 1988, when the local parish planned to demolish the building, Joseph M. Toole bought it for $1 \\n\\n\\"I didn't have any plans for it but I didn't want to see it torn down,\\" said Mr. Toole, a Lee native who attended kindergarten in the building. \\n\\nHe had the 300-ton building moved to a nearby half-acre lot on the corner of Main and Elm Streets next to his family's insurance agency.\\n\\nEarly this year, after unsuccessfully trying to market the building for office space, Mr. Toole decided to make it an inn, which he now operates full time. He estimated the combined cost of the move, site work, remodeling and furnishings at $750,000. \\n\\nMr. Toole said he had borne two-thirds of the costs and had borrowed the rest.\\n\\nThe nine-room inn is on a slight slope and Mr. Toole had a new foundation and lower floor built.

For 10 years, the management has staged the outdoor event on the Sunday afternoon preceding Thanksgiving, presumably with the good taste to refrain from serving the winners on a platter later in the week.    Turkeys come from all over Connecticut and neighboring states, as well as from the inn's own stock, to compete for wreaths of Indian corn, which are draped over the necks of the winners. The prizes may be consumed at the inn or as take-out.Owners or trainers of victorious poultry will be treated to dinner for two at the inn.    After the 20-foot Olympic torch is lit at 1:30 P.M., the games will begin. Several 50-foot races will be run on a 12-lane track, and there will be high-jump and slalom competitions. Fashion will be important, with the best-dressed turkey receiving an award, along with the heaviest and the greediest -- that is, the bird who can gobble a bowl of feed fastest.    Admission is free. For more information or directions to 107 North Shore Road, call 868-0563. QUARTET OF ROOMMATES     A contemporary English comedy about four roommates who live in the basement flat of a large Victorian house opens with previews at the Long Wharf Theater in New Haven on Tuesday. The title, \\"Valued Friends,\\" refers to their relationships, which are thrown into chaos when a real-estate speculator offers them a large sum of money to vacate the premises.    Arvin Brown, artistic director of Long Wharf, saw the play at the Hampstead Theater in London earlier this year. It won the Most Promising Playwright Award from the London Evening Standard for its author, Stephen Jeffreys.    Long Wharf imported most of the people associated with the original production, including the director, Robin Lefevre, who is the associate director of the Hampstead Theater, and Sue Plummer, who designed the sets and costumes.    Performances are at 8 P.M. Tuesday through Friday, 4 and 8:30 P.M. Saturday, 2 and 7:30 P.M. Sunday, with 2 P.M. matinees scheduled on Dec. 12 and 26, and Jan. 2. The play will open Nov. 29 and run through Jan. 6, with tickets $24 to $29. Tickets for preview performances, Tuesday through Nov. 28, are $14 and $16. Tuesdays and Fridays are pay-what-you-can nights, with tickets available only on the day of the performance. The box office number is 787-4282. FRAKTUR ART     Is anyone in your family named Gamler or Breszler or Batscha? Did your forebears come from Pennsylvania Dutch country, perhaps Berks, Dauphin, Lebanon, North Hampton or Lecha (Lehigh) Counties? If so, or even if not, a fascinating exhibition of fraktur, Pennsylvania Dutch hand-painted woodcuts that commemorated marriages, births, deaths and all sorts of family celebrations, is worth a look at the Poster Gallery in Ridgefield.    About 30 examples, some framed, will be on display through Nov. 30.    The word fraktur originally referred to the early German block lettering that described the event in the picture, as opposed to cursive or connected writing. Now it is the name used for the pictures themselves.    Because they were printed on rag paper, these examples have survived the years without deterioration. George Goodstadt, owner of the gallery, bought his collection in 1974 from Huntington Hartford.     The earliest piece in the show, and the most expensive, is dated 1795, from the Angstadt family, priced at $700 framed. The latest and among the lowest priced costs $300, dated 1906, with a text in English, from the Fetter family. Mr. Goodstadt said an 18th-century fraktur brought $110,000 at an October auction at Sotheby's in Manhattan.    The Poster Collection is at 17 Danbury Road, open Tuesday through Saturday from 10 A.M. to 4 P.M. The phone number is 438-1836. LIVING TRADITIONS     Celebrating its 15th anniversary, the American Indian Archeological Insitute in Washington has opened a new permanent exhibit, \\"As We Tell our Stories: Living Traditions and the Algonkian People of Indian New England.\\" Rather than a chronological documentation of events and artifacts, the multimedia exhibition integrates the past and present, demonstrating how the Algonkian people once lived and how they live today.   Among Algonkians are the Wampanoag, the Pequot, the Pauggussett and many other groups with their own cultures and languages.    Seven elements form the structure of the exhibition: land, exchange, corn, deer, manitou (spiritual values), living traditions, clay, and living spaces. They are exemplified by artifacts like prehistoric stone, shell, bone and wood tools used for the cultivation and cooking of corn","excerpt":"18th-century petitions from the Schaghticoke people to the Connecticut General Assembly, asking to retain Indian lands; the diary of an early 20th-century Mohegan woman, and late 19th- and early 20th-century photographs.    Tapes of the voices of Algonkian individuals and oral histories by many of the state's elderly people will be incorporated into the exhibit in 1991.    An Algonkian village has been reconstructed on the institute's grounds, with wigwams, a furnished longhouse and a typical vegetable garden. Some of the artifacts date back 10,000 years and were excavated in Connecticut by the institute's staff.    The institute is on Curtis Road, off Route 199. Visiting hours are Monday through Saturday, 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. and Sunday, noon to 5 P.M. Admission is $3, $2 for children from 6 to 16. Call 868-0518 for more information. ALL STRINGS     The most gifted students from Hall and Conard High Schools in West Hartford make up the approximately 22-member, all-string chamber-music ensemble called I Giovani Solisti (The Young Soloists). They will perform the music of Mozart, Victor Herbert, Handel, Gershwin and Albinoni at 3 this afternoon at Trinity Episcopal Church in Hartford. Zane Gordy, music director at Trinity, will accompany the group at the organ.    Formed in 1983 and continuing with an ever-changing roster as senior members graduate and freshmen enter, I Giovani Solisti has performed in Europe and is scheduled to give concerts in London and Dublin later this year.    Both high schools have full orchestras in which the chamber group members must participate. Edwin De Groat is the director of all three ensembles.    The church is at 120 Sigourney Street, and admission is by donation of $3 at the door. Call 527-8133 for more information.
