McClane's ''The Encyclopedia of Fish Cookery'' (Holt, Rinehart & Winston, 1977). Recently, when reading up on clams, we were fascinated by his observation that the shells of the hard clam once served as a form of currency in America. ''Black wampum,'' made from the heart of the large quahog shell, was strung into bands or belts and ''served for money in the eastern colonies until the end of the 17th century.'' (Quahog, by the way, is the Algonquin Indian name for all the hard-shell clams, including littlenecks, cherrystones and chowder clams.)   Clearly, settlers of these shores have had a passion for clams in almost any form almost since the moment they arrived here. And we are among them. Because of our fondness for clams, we recently spent a good deal of time in our kitchen preparing them according to ''our own fashion.'' The dishes that evolved included mushrooms stuffed with clams flavored with tarragon, baked clams with a snail butter and walnuts, and clams in a black-bean and oyster sauce. The last recipe is actually a slight variation on the Chinese version of the dish we created several years ago while writing a Chinese cookbook with the late Virginia Lee.

Two hours of one distinctive and pervasive piano style, unrelieved by any other  point of view, holds the threat of overkill. But in the right hands (and Mr. Schiff's are the right ones), sameness can become something better: call it reinforcement, or amplification. The more one heard on Wednesday, the clearer Schumann became. One saw the grace of the \\"Arabeske\\" and the flying fragments of the \\"Davidsbundlertanze\\" and \\"Symphonic Etudes\\" for what they are: microcosms of a great Romantic upheaval.         Schumann helped bury the Enlightenment under a new and glorious disorder. Song form, and its traditions of beginning-middle-beginning-end, do invest the \\"Arabeske\\" and the D-Flat major \\"Blumenstuck\\" with rational shape. But in the rest of this program, freshness of thought was a thing in itself, not the building material for musical architecture. In the 18 numbers of the \\"Davidsbundlertanze\\" and the 13 of the \\"Symphonic Etudes,\\" Schumann blurts out one idea after another, as if to get them in the ear and on paper before the reasoning mind can corrupt them.

The home base of Shakespeare and Company, an organization devoted principally to the production of and training in Elizabethan drama, it is steeped in an atmosphere that is equal parts academia and bohemia. Snatches of blank verse float into the woodland air, as fresh-faced actors perform and rehearse amid stands of pines and on hillsides, and the views are truly idyllic. It all has the effect of making one want to be 19 and reciting something lyrical, preferably with a Gitane and a moody gaze.   There is nothing adolescent or dilettantish, however, about the work that is being done in the four indoor and outdoor spaces that the company has carved out for its summer repertory. Since assuming residency here in 1978, Shakespeare and Company, led firmly by its artistic director, Tina Packer, has created a strong, cohesive and sui generis language-based style in its approach to Shakespearean text, which stresses the relevance of the plays to audiences of all backgrounds. It is the company's credo that the beauty of the language should always be subordinate to its meaning, and that the meaning is topically evergreen. During the nonsummer months, the company takes its plays and its teachers on the road, into schools and community outreach programs throughout New England, and its function always seems to be to explain as well as to entertain. Perhaps as a consequence, subtlety is not the troupe's strong suit","excerpt":"clarity and accessibility very definitely are.

THE SCREEN IN REVIEW","excerpt":"Clark Gable and Loretta Young Play Mayors in 'Key to the City,' at Loew's State"},{"year":"1939","title":"It is with boundless enthusiasm, with uncritical hornpipes in the street, and wild huzzas of approval that finally, at long last, we hail the arrival of an adult picture on the local screen. As a profoundly bitter preview—profound because its bitterness wears the mask of comedy—of the trivial circumstances which will undoubtedly attend the beginning of the next World War, \\"Idiot's Delight,\\" at the Capitol, is as timely as tomorrow's front page.Discounting the picture's more obviously amusing features—Norma Shearer as a phony Russian refugee in a slinky gown, balancing a long cigarette holder","excerpt":"Clark Gable as a song-and-dance man in a striped suit (wait till you see those dance routines!)—the grown-ups may revel in its Jovian humors, its accuracy of continental detail and characterization, combined with fastidious philosophical detachment. Perhaps its geography is a trifle vague (though the underlings of what was the Hotel Monte Gabriele on the stage still courageously speak Italian). It is true that all references to dictators have been expunged, that the raiding aircraft are incognito and that the bombs burst anonymously in air.But for all the accustomed and too, too predictable fury of its soft-pedaling, \\"Idiot's Delight,\\" by the very nature of its theme, exposes the essential idiocy and pointlessness of militarism, and that is the important thing. In fact, it would be less \\"true\\" to identify with national labels the suicidal greed, the monstrous complacency toward death and destruction which are not racial, but universal; not individual, but mass phenomena, as ugly and as international as hate. Perhaps in this case we should applaud Hollywood for keeping things on the philosophical plane.As for the chief characters, they have retained their considerable, if somewhat pat, theatrical charm, and they are still Mr. Sherwood's. The ex-acrobat siren, bravely carrying on her shabby little pretense against the world, lest her heart wilt with self-knowledge; the expatriate vaudevillian, heroically living from hoof to mouth with his girl team (\\"Les Blondes\\"), but still taking jaunty ads in the Billboard to wish his \\"many pals\\" on Broadway a prosperous New Year. (There is something infinitely sad about this bravado, this terrible pride of \\"show business.\\") Truly they are not great representatives of the civilization we feel it is important to preserve against the bombs. Charles Coburn, the scientist, with his cages of rats; Burgess Meredith, the pacifist, with his burning protests, are incomparably more important. No, in the classically tragic sense, it does not really matter what happens to such people; that, precisely, is the pity of it.And when the war for which there was no excuse finally overtakes them, a pair of not-so-innocent bystanders (Irene at last acknowledges that casual amour back in the cheap hotel in Omaha, before she acquired her Slavic hauteur and her furs) overtakes them by accident, in the hotel which was too near an air-base, the following situation presents itself: Here is Irene, without a passport, deserted by her French munitions manufacturer in a world gone mad (this Monsieur \\"Vay-bair,\\" described by Mr. Sherwood as \\"a thin, keen executive,\\" is played by Edward Arnold). And here is Harry, with his ineffective Broadway patter, feeling for the first time the ennobling emotion of love. These two alone, forsaken even by the jabberwocky of international hotel society, under a rain of death from the skies.Well, we are ready to suppose that the present American ending, on what can only be described as a note of defiant hooferism, with Gable pounding on the piano and Miss Shearer ecstatically \\"trucking\\" as the walls collapse, was the best that was cinematically available. (There is a different ending for Great Britain, with sentimental songs). Even that effect of the conventional movie fadeout, as the bombers recede, we can accept. No doubt the fine irony of Mr. Sherwood's conclusion that feeling, as the \\"two cheap people\\" burst hysterically into \\"Onward Christian Soldiers.\\" that the gods were laughing would have been unseemly in a movie theatre.Yet it is a trivial, faintly detestable world we have seen (despite the careful cinematic prologue of Miss Shearer as a young girl daydreamer, and Gable as a World War veteran), and though the end, violent or otherwise, seems epically unimportant, there remains a feeling that the really significant thing was the final psychological disintegration of these two characters. Regardless of what happened to the world, it seems more appropriate that they should end, in the words of T. S. Eliot. \\"Not with a bang, but a whimper.\\" Did we say that \\"Idiot's Delight\\" makes a swell movie? If you don't see it you'll be missing one of the year's events.

The Supreme Court ruled that the Government can prosecute people for crimes and seize their property at the same time. The decision overturned rulings that said requiring a convicted drug dealer to give  up property amounted to punishing someone twice for the same crime. In April, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit relied on those rulings when it issued guidelines for judges to use to decide if notifying a community of the whereabouts of a paroled sex offender was unconstitutional.          Yesterday's Supreme Court ruling coincided with a hearing before Judge John  W. Bissell of Federal District Court on the constitutionality of the notification law, known as \\"Megan's Law.\\" In March, the judge blocked the notification provisions, and Judge Bissell said yesterday he was not certain the Supreme Court ruling applied to the law because it dealt with property, not people. The state Public Defender's Office, which is trying to overturn the law, said the forfeiture ruling had no bearing on it.
