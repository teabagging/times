All the locations, buildings and interiors look like the real thing. And the actors fit into their costumes as though they had been wearing them all their lives. You don't notice their hands hanging out like a couple of lonely hams looking for trouser pockets to hide themselves to. And the grand physical end vocal gestures of another age sit easily upon them. The past is still very much alive in Europe, and so the film is able to portray it with a sense of reality, of sincerity, which it is hard for us to get in Hollywood.\\"Yorck,\\" which has just had its première at the Ufa Palast, is an example of the German historical film at its best. Technically perfect, it runs like a great silent motor, reaching heights of power without seeming to have plumbed its reserves of strength. The acting is on the highest level, the direction is concise and vigorous, the photography squeezes out the last drop of optical beauty without forcing itself tastelessly into the foreground. If there is an objection to be made, it is that the whole has a certain stiffness, a historical cramp. It is as though all the actors realized that they were portraying figures out of a history textbook and that this weighed a bit on the freedom of their characterizations. They are so majestic and weighty that they seem continually posing for postage stamps. Yes, sir, it certainly is historical.General Yorck.The scenario of the film is built around the Prussian General Yorck, who is known in history more for what he did not do than for what he did. Against the orders of the Prussian King, Frederick William IV, he signed a treaty with the Czar and withdrew his troops from Russian soil. This despite the fact that the King had signed an alliance with Napoleon and was in duty bound to help him against the Muscovites.In the rôle of Yorck the Ufa had Werner Krauss, perhaps the greatest actor of the German stage, to throw into the film's balance. This very extraordinary player gave depth and a certain exciting wildness to a part which in other hands might have seemed flat and uninteresting. Krauss has that tinge of madness about him which is in all really great actors. He has himself in marvelous physical control and his humor is light, human and precise. But when the big emotional moments come, something strange and uncanny flickers up from his depth. His eyes catch you with the fascination of the ancient mariner. And. how marvelously Krauss speaks the German language. Every word is clear cut and yet spoken with the greatest naturalness and simplicity. Werner Krauss is alone on that still small plateau where once Mansfield and Salvini stood.The direction of Gustav Ucicky has no particular individual qualities, but it is technically perfect and never dams the flow of the plot. And Karl Hoffmann's photography has the same pictorial glamour which characterizes all his work for the film—you may recall the extraordinary sheen he threw around \\"Das Fiötenkonzert von Sans-Souci.\\"Subtle Propaganda.The picture is a piece of nationalistic propaganda, but so subtle that it is hardly discrenible. There is continual mention of France as the real enemy of Germany and the French do not come off any too well in the film. And in the last scene, when the returned Prussian troops parade through the Brandenburger Tor in Berlin, Yorck proclaims in ringing tones that he will only return to Prussia when it is freed from the bondage of France. And the whole spirit of the film is militaristic. But, on the other hand, Yorck is a rebel who disobeys the order of his sovereign and that hardly fits into the usual nationalistic viewpoint. So there is something for democrat and monarchist. Bring the children.In the same week we had the German premiere of Marlene Dietrich in \\"Dishonored.\\" This was unfortunate, as this picture is an unhappily apt example of how the Germans do not like their historical pictures. A wild gale of laughter burst forth when Marlene as the Austrian spy, who is sentenced to be shot, banged around on a piano in her cell and then made up her lips using the sword of an officer as a mirror. Also the yapping of von Seyffertitz as the head of the Secret Service gave the audience some honest moments of amusement. This type of acting seems peculiarly old-fashioned here today—if you will compare it with the playing of Oskar Homolka as the Russian General in \\"Geheimdlenst\\" you will see what I mean. But those were all minor points","excerpt":"the deciding factor, is that it seems to be physically impossible to make a film with Continental atmosphere in Hollywood. Here they know how European people really act and they are therefore unwilling to accept Hollywood's version. And yet the pictures which the American producers show us here are almost all set in the European scene. That is to my mind the strongest reason for the continuous failure of American films here. But then the Americans cannot show their best pictures, the characteristically American pictures, because they would not be understood here. \\"Front Page\\" and \\"Five Star Final\\" have a barrier of slang and a barrier of viewpoint on life between them and the Germans.And then the Ufa has again shown us how to make en operetta film. \\"Ronny,\\" now playing at the Gloria Palast, is a worthy successor of \\"Drei von der Tankstelle\\" and \\"Einbrecher.\\" And this time the musical side has been even more strongly stressed by the engagement of Emmerich Kalmàn. With Lehàar, Oscar Straus and Leo Fall, he was the backbone of the Viennese musical comedy school at its best. His \\"Czardas Duchess\\" and \\"Countess Maritza\\" are works which take their place beside \\"The Merry Widow\\" and \\"The Chocolate Soldier.\\" And now he has composed his first score for the audible screen. It is studded with musical delicacies for those who can appreciate them and its lingering melodies must embed themselves deeply in everybody's memory. Now we know how such a music score should be written.Outstanding Films.DER DEUTSCHE, an enterprising Berlin daily, has again conducted its yearly round-robin on well-known personalities to select the best film of the year. Of course, a larger proportion of the answers was from Germans but there were still enough American and French votes to give the results international value. This is proved by the fact that an American film won third place and that a Russian film was also included among the first ten. First was \\"Mädchen in Uniform,\\" that exquisite outsider film which pictures life in a girls' boarding school. It was made on a profit-sharing basis and neither the directress nor any of the actors was known to the screen public. Ufa's spectacular \\"Congress Dances,\\" of which you have surely reports from here and from London, ran it a close second. Third was our \\"Cimarron\\"; fourth \\"Kameradschaft,\\" that stirring picturization of a mine disaster; fifth, \\"Berge in Flammen,\\" an Alpine war subject-Sixth came the only Russian. \\"The Road Back to Life;\\" seventh, our \\"Skippy\\"; eighth, \\"M,\\" Fritz Lang's filmization of the Düsseldorf child murderer; ninth, our \\"Morocco\\"; tenth, \\"Dimitri Karamazoff,\\" in which Fritz Kortner and Anna Sten appeared. Among the first twenty-five were other American pictures: \\"Tabu,\\" \\"American Tragedy,\\" \\"Street Scene,\\" \\"Trader Horn,\\" \\"Front Page,\\" \\"City Lights,\\" \\"The Smiling Lieutenant,\\" and \\"Bad Girl.\\"Among well-known authors the Frenchman André Maurois liked \\"Jean de la Lune\\" by Marcel Achard. And Luigi Pirandello was aroused by the way his short story \\"En Silence\\" was put on the screen. He closed: \\"The silent film had a better atmosphere. Now that it sings and speaks we realize that it is nothing but a trick. The illusions have vanished.\\"Mussolini's Choice.Mussolini seems to be the one statesman who is interested in the film. He wrote that \\"Trader Horn\\" was the only film he saw twice.Among the actors and actresses there was little to get excited about, but you may be interested to hear that Marie Dressier saw only one film, \\"Dishonored.\\" And that Charlie Chaplin, our best parlor Bolshevik, chose the Russian film, \\"Enthusiasm,\\" directed by Werthoff.The film had brutal slaps in the face from two American authors: Mencken wrote that he unhappily hadn't seen a single film in 1931, and George Sylvester Viereck declared categorically that there hadn't been a single first-rate film made.Of American newspaper owners William Randolph Hearst selected \\"Hell Divers,\\" because, as he admitted, his chief interest was in the marines and the fliers. Joseph Medill Patterson was for \\"Waterloo Bridge.\\"The selections of the film critics took up the largest space and covered newspapers with a joint circulation of over twenty-six millions. Erwin Gephard, the enterprising critic of Der Deutsche who arranged this contest, selected a list which is too long to quote but was certainly original if nothing else. He put Walt Disney's \\"Silly Symphonies\\" and Fischinger's \\"Cubistic Studies\\" at its head and included also an enormous number of educationals and scenics.The writer of these lines did not feel that he could select any one film, but sent a list made up of \\"Mädchen in Uniform,\\" \\"Der Brave Sunder,\\" \\"Niemandsland,\\" \\"Wer nimmt die Liebe ernst,\\" \\"Ariane\\" and \\"Karamazoff.\\" And he had to report that he had not been able to include any American films on his list because he had no opportunity to see our better pictures in their original form.

Not to have seen those originals - all of them small, and many no larger than a passport photograph - is to have missed something as fundamental to the English achievement as the sonnets of Shakespeare and the polyphony of Thomas Tallis and William Byrd.   This being so, it is an event of the first importance that the Victoria and Albert Museum in London should have agreed to lend so large a number of the very finest Elizabethan, Jacobean and Caroline miniatures to the Yale Center for British Art.

Freed, a Boston attorney, writes frequently on legal questions related to high technology and is founder of the Computer Law Association.  ^By ROY N. FREED ^c.1983 N.Y.

The head of computer operations at a major research hospital is shocked to learn that a group of ''hackers'' in Podunk has got into its computer system, destroyed records of many years of research work done under a grant from a medical device manufacturer and apparently rummaged around in patients' records besides. The story hits the national press. In an atmosphere of great public embarrassment, the hospital's president calls in its eminent, gray-haired legal counsel. He is asked for guidance on how to bolster the institution's reputation by teaching the hackers a lesson, and to fend off lawsuits by the manufacturer whose research money is at stake, by patients whose privacy is invaded and by the supplier of the systems security software program, whose reputation is besmirched. If you think that this story is fanciful, reread your newspapers of recent months. And think how much the hospital will have to pay for the complex legal assistance such a situation demands. Will it get its money's worth? Much depends on the care with which it chooses its legal counsel and the extent to which its attorneys have educated themselves in the intricacies of high technology.

Lowell P. Weicker Jr., erstwhile Senate Republican maverick, used his strong local appeal to capture the anti-incumbent fever that swept through the electorate and win the governorship as an independent with 40 percent of the vote. He beat Representative John G. Rowland, the Republican nominee, and Representative Bruce A. Morrison, the Democrat.  [ Page B15. ]   Mr. Weicker and Walter Hickel of Alaska were the first independents elected governor of a state since 1974.    The candidates vying to replace Mr. Morrison and Mr. Rowland also ran close races.   Rosa DeLauro, 47 years old, a Democrat who has never held elective office, won Mr. Morrison's seat in the Third District, defeating State Senator Thomas Scott.   Mr. Rowland's vacated seat in the Fifth District was filled by a fellow Republican, Gary Frank, who became the first black Republican elected to a voting position in the House of Representatives since 1935. Mr. Frank defeated former Representative Toby Moffett, a liberal Democrat.   Democrats held on to the Legislature.  DELAWARE    Incumbents in two major races won by 2-to-1 ratios, sweeping aside challenges from underfinanced political newcomers who tried to exploit voters' frustration with Washington politicians.    Joseph R. Biden Jr., who was himself a political neophyte when he first won election to the Senate in 1972, pushed back a challenge from M. Jane Brady, a Republican. Ms. Brady, who is chief prosecutor for Sussex County, ran on an anti-incumbent platform, calling for a citizens' Legislature with a two-term limit.    Delaware has only one at-large seat in the House, and the Democratic incumbent, Thomas R. Carper, won a fourth term. He defeated Ralph O. Williams, a real estate developer. The savings and loan crisis was a primary issue in the campaign. Mr. Carper is a member of the House Banking Committee, and Mr. Williams is a former president of a savings and loan association.    Republicans retained control of the State House while Democrats kept the upper hand in the Senate. DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA    District of Columbia voters sent Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr. an unambiguous message, electing one of his leading detractors, Sharon Pratt Dixon, to replace him as Mayor and denying him an at-large seat on the City Council. Ms. Dixon, a utility company executive, had promised to clean out the scandal-plagued City Hall \\"with a shovel, not a broom.\\"   In the race for the city's non-voting delegate to the House, Eleanor Holmes Norton, the former chairwoman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, won easily in a city where Democrats outnumber Republicans 9 to 1.    Meanwhile, the Rev. Jesse Jackson must determine what his new job of \\"shadow senator\\" will mean in practice. The non-voting post is a lobby for the city in the Senate.  MAINE     It was a night of nail-biting for Gov. John R. McKernan Jr. and his wife, Representative Olympia J. Snowe, both Republicans. Governor McKernan barely beat Representative Joseph E. Brennan, a former Democratic Governor who sought his old job. Representative Snowe withstood a surprisingly strong challenge by Patrick McGowan, a Democratic state lawmaker.    Senator William S. Cohen, the Republican incumbent, defeated State Representative Neil Rolde. In the race to replace Mr. Brennan in Maine's First Congressional District, Thomas H. Andrews, a liberal Democrat who had built one of the strongest grass-roots organizations in the state, crushed David F. Emery, a conservative Republican who held the seat from 1975 until 1983.    Democrats maintained their hold on the State Legislature, and voters approved a referendum allowing businesses to remain open on Sundays.  MARYLAND     The incumbent Governor, William Donald Schaefer, a 69-year-old Democrat and ex-Mayor of Baltimore, soundly defated his Republican opponent, William S. Shepard, a retired Foreign Service officer. Mr. Schaefer got half again as many votes as Mr. Shepard.   In the state's First Congressional District, the five-term incumbent Democrat, Roy P. Dyson, 41, was defeated almost as solidly by his Republican challenger, Wayne T. Gilchrest, a 44-year-old high school teacher who also ran against him in 1988.    Mr. Dyson had been renominated by his party despite the dislosure that he had been a conscientious objector at the time of the Vietnam War. Mr. Gilchrest won a Purple Heart as a marine in Vietnam.   Mr. Gilchrest had more liberal positions than Mr. Dyson on some issues, including support for abortion rights.   The Democrats retained control of the State Legislature. MASSACHUSETTS    After a duel that riveted the state's attention, John R. Silber, the Boston University president who ran as the tart-tongued Democratic candidate, conceded victory to his Republican opponent, William F. Weld, the former United States Attorney who served in the Justice Department during the Reagan Administration.  [ Page B2. ]   Mr. Weld was helped by Dr. Silber's blunt personality, which drove many of the state's overwhelmingly Democratic voters to abandon their party loyalties.   Both candidates favored approval of Question 3, a referendum that would have slashed state budget revenues by about $1.1 billion through cuts in various fees and taxes, but the voters defeated the proposition.    Senator John Kerry, a Democrat, struggled to distance himself from Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, whom he served as Lieutenant Governor from 1982 to 1984. His Republican opponent, Jim Rappaport, a millionaire real estate developer and lawyer, emphasized Mr. Kerry's ties to the retiring Governor.    Representative Chester G. Atkins, a Democrat, won a tight re-election race in the Fifth District against State Representative John F. MacGovern. Democrats retained control of the Legislature, though they lost ground in both houses. NEW HAMPSHIRE    The Republican National Committee's strategy to recruit House members to run for open Senate seats worked well in New Hampshire as Representative Robert C. Smith defeated former Senator John A. Durkin. The seat was vacated by retirement of Senator Gordon J. Humphrey, a Republican.    The race to fill Mr. Smith's First District seat was a tight one, but William Zeliff, an Republican innkeeper who portrayed himself as a tightwad, withstood the challenge of Joseph F. Keefe. a Democrat.    The freshman Republican Representative in the Second District, Chuck Douglas, was upset by a 33-year-old architect, Dick Swett, who is the son-in-law of Representative Tom Lantos of California.    The Democrats could not unseat the Republican Governor, Judd Gregg. Control of the Legislature remains with the Republicans, as well.  NEW JERSEY     It looked like an upset in the making but in the end Senator Bill Bradley narrowly defeated Christine Todd Whitman, a virtually unknown Republican candidate whom he had outspent 12 to 1.  [ Page B16. ]   Mr. Bradley's slim victory contrasted with his 1984 race, when he won 64 percent of the vote. The closeness of Tuesday's vote is expected to cloud Mr. Bradley's position as a potential Presidential candidate in 1992.   Incumbents in 12 of the 14 Congressional districts were re-elected, but there were tough races in the districts once held by Gov. James J. Florio and his opponent in last year's election for governor, Representative Jim Courter. In Mr. Florio's former First District seat, the Democrat, Robert E. Andrews, the Camden County Freeholder Director, won despite being criticized for his connection to the Governor. In the 12th District, State Senator Richard A. Zimmer, a Republican, outdistanced Marguerite Chandler, a businesswoman.    New Jersey lost one Congressional seat after the 1980 census and is expected to lose another this year. Democrats control the Legislature and are likely to try to eliminate a Republican district.  NEW YORK    Against two opponents, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, 58 years old, easily won his bid for a third term, though not nearly by the margin many had expected. Mr. Cuomo mustered barely 53 percent of the nearly 3.8 million votes cast in the three-way contest, compared with the 65 percent he won four years ago. His opponents this time were Pierre A. Rinfret, a Republican, and Herbert London on the Conservative Party ticket.   Mr. Rinfret garnered 22 percent of the vote, just enough ahead of Mr. London's 21 percent to keep the Republicans as the state's No. 2 party on future ballots.  [ Page B13. ]   Mr. Cuomo's coattails also failed to help his party gain control of the State Senate, important for legislative and Congressional redistricting. The Republicans maintained control of the Senate while the Democrats kept a majority in the State Assembly.  [ Page B12. ]   Mr. Cuomo's frequent appeals also failed to attract sufficient support to pass a proposed $1.9 billion environment bond issue. PENNSYLVANIA    Representative Doug Walgren, a seven-term Democratic Congressman from Pittsburgh, earned the distinction of being one of only a handful of incumbents to lose this year. He lost to Richard Santorum, who was making his first run at elective office. Mr. Santorum, a 32-year-old Republican lawyer, ran his campaign as a grass-roots effort to unseat an incumbent who spent more time in Washington than in Pittsburgh.    Gov. Robert P. Casey, a popular Democrat whom no seasoned Republican dared to oppose this year, won by a landslide. He defeated State Auditor General Barbara Hafer, a Republican with little statewide experience. Mrs. Hafer never got her campaign rolling and never recovered from gaffes, like calling Mr. Casey a \\"red-necked Irishman\\" in a state with a large Irish population.    Redistricting is expected to cost Pennsylvania 2 of its 23 seats in the House, and Democrats will largely control the remapping since they increased their control of the State House and came within a seat of splitting control of the State Senate.   Voters approved ballot initiatives for selling bonds to build prisons and buy equipment for firefighters and ambulance services.  RHODE ISLAND    By a 74-to-26 percent majority, Bruce G. Sundlun, a 70-year-old Democratic broadcasting executive, defeated the incumbent Governor, Edward D. DiPrete, a 56-year-old Republican in a heavily Democratic state.   Mr. Sundlun lost to Mr. DiPrete in 1986 and 1988.    Mr. DiPrete's approval ratings, reaching as high as 88 percent in early 1988, plummeted amid negative publicity that year concerning his family's $2 million profit in a single day on a real estate transaction in Cranston, where he had served as Mayor.    Claiborne Pell, a Democrat who was first elected to the Senate in 1961, defeated Claudine Schneider. Ms. Schneider, a 43-year-old Republican, gave up her seat in the House to challenge Mr. Pell.    State Representative Jack Reed, a Democrat, defeated Trudy Coxe, a Republican involved in environmental issues, to win Ms. Schneider's former seat in the House. VERMONT     Bernard Sanders is the first socialist to win a seat in Congress since an East Harlem man, Vito Marcantonio, served in the 1940's. Mr. Sanders, who ran as an independent, beat the Republican incumbent, Peter Smith.    Mr. Sanders, who was born in Brooklyn and was Mayor of Burlington from 1981 to 1989, played down his Marxist views and led the public chorus of dissatisfaction with incumbents, Washington and negative advertising.    Mr. Smith, who got a late start on his campaign because Federal budget delays kept him in Washington, ran a negative advertisement late in the campaign that political analysts say cost him more votes than it gained.    Richard A. Snelling, the popular four-term Republican Governor from 1976 to 1984, defeated Peter F. Welch, the Democratic President pro tempore of the State Senate, in the governor's race. Mr. Snelling, who is 63 years old and owns an investment business, projected an image as a fiscal conservative and prudent manager. Mr. Welch, 43, sought to undermine Mr. Snelling's campaign with negative advertising that portrayed Mr. Snelling as a wealthy businessman out of touch with Vermonters.    Democrats lost two seats in the State House to progressive independents, which gave Republicans a two-seat advantage","excerpt":"the Democrats also lost one seat in the State Senate, splitting control of that body. WEST VIRGINIA    The 1990 election left West Virginia much as it found it: a land of wall-to-wall Democrats. The predominant party held on to everything from the Legislature to the Senate seat of John D. Rockefeller 4th.   Senator Rockefeller had no trouble defeating John Yoder, a Harper's Ferry lawyer who had no success in portraying Mr. Rockefeller as a \\"captive of special interests.\\"    Oliver Luck, a Republican lawyer, hoped to provide a little electoral variety, figuring that perhaps his fame as a quarterback at West Virginia University would help him defeat Representative Harley O. Staggers Jr., a four-term Congressman, in the mountainous Second District. But the seat that has been either Mr. Staggers's or his father's for all but two years in the past half-century will stay in the Staggers family.

It is based on the work of Camilo Jose Vergara, a journalist who has been photographing poor communities across the United States for 15 years. Mr. Vergara's pictures record the emergence of what he contends is a new urban form. Unlike the traditional skid row, which was a product of social neglect, today's slum is as institutionalized as an Army camp. And in contrast to the public-housing projects of a generation ago, the ghetto is now a full-service community where the services consist of shelters, clinics, police stations and prisons.   Mr. Vergara's photographs show this development unfolding in stages in cities nationwide: the collapse of local industries that once provided jobs","excerpt":"the demolition of residential buildings that have decayed beyond repair and the appearance on this erased terrain of new, fortresslike buildings that house what the photographer terms \\"the homeless industry.\\" Not all of Mr. Vergara's images are bleak. Many poor communities are rich in wall paintings blazing with color and indignation. It is evident, however, that such murals are now as standard a feature of ghetto life as methadone clinics; the viewer is left with the impression that even outlets for anger have been institutionalized.

(Among the reasons for the reclusiveness are Goddard's fear of wounding his father, who is in the classical music business and despises rock, and his own hyper-consciousness of the numberless rock stars before him whose failure to seal themselves off from the mob destroyed them.) The action of the book centers on a scheme contrived by a post-Stockhausen-style composer named Patrick Domostroy, whose career is in disarray, and his sexually kinky girlfriend to locate Goddard and penetrate his secrets.

But when the notice of her swearing-in ceremony arrived, her heart sank. The ceremony had already taken place.   The baby sitter missed a second and then a third swearing-in because subsequent notices from the Immigration and Naturalization Service also arrived too late. So, anxious and confused, she turned last spring for help to her boss, who happened to be the Deputy Attorney General.   Ms. Gorelick oversees the immigration agency, but she said she had called the I.N.S. \\"just as myself.\\" Transferred from number to number, she lingered on hold \\"for what seemed like forever,\\" she said, until she was finally disconnected. She tried again and reached an answering machine. She left her name, home phone number and a request for assistance.   But the immigration service never returned the Deputy Attorney General's call.   With that brief encounter, Ms. Gorelick got a taste of how the I.N.S. often treats its principal clients, for illegal immigrants, criminal aliens and corrupt brokers do not consume the bulk of its time. Rather, the agency expends most of its effort serving more than four million people from around the world who each year make simple and perfectly legal requests for benefits, from working papers to citizenship.   Every one of these clients pays a fee, generating $576 million this year, or a third of the agency's budget. Yet immigration officials acknowledge that the agency often fails to provide them with humane, efficient service, leaving people like Ms. Gorelick's baby sitter (who eventually was sworn in) unnecessarily anguished.   \\"We're a monopoly, yet we make people suffer,\\" said Phil Waters, the acting director of the agency's San Francisco office. \\"It's crazy. People are paying good money to get service from the Government, and we're not giving it.\\"   Every day, across the country, immigrants' phone calls go unanswered and their letters sit unopened. Their files get lost, and their cases get improperly entered in antiquated databases. And often, because they get only a busy signal or a recording by phone, immigrants stand for hours, sometimes even overnight, in lines that snake through office buildings and parking lots.   In an interview, Attorney General Janet Reno said she had not quite believed a friend in Miami who told her that it was impossible to reach the agency by phone. So she tried calling the Miami number herself -- and could not get through.   With 19,000 employees and 65 nearly autonomous offices around the world, the immigration service is not a monolith. Every day, some immigration officers rise above their daily tribulations and hobbling constraints to offer compassionate, intelligent service. And any agency that serves almost five million clients a year is going to offend some of them and make mistakes with others.   But the I.N.S. mishandles far more cases than its share because the agency is organized in a way that allows some barely trained employees to bark at the clients, turn a deaf ear to their complaints or mishandle their requests.   \\"A lot of people have gone out of their way to make this a cold, rude, insensitive and inefficient agency,\\" said A. D. Moyer, director of the immigration district in Chicago.   The I.N.S. is charged with two missions that many people inside and outside the agency find to be in conflict. On the one hand, the agency polices the borders and airports, arrests criminals and expels illegal immigrants. On the other, it provides services to an overwhelming majority who travel or already live here legally.   Of these two sides of the agency's personality, law enforcement has always dominated. In fact, making arrests at the border has always been the road to advancement. As a result, many legal aliens have long complained that some immigration agents treat them like criminal suspects. This attitude, coupled with the inefficiency that riddles the agency, often causes headaches and worse.   \\"The I.N.S. is completely like a Soviet bureaucracy,\\" said Leonid Zagalsky, 39, a Russian immigrant in New York. \\"Every sign starts with the word 'no': No smoking. No standing. No sitting. No asking questions. You cannot reach a human being by phone. And when you go, you stand for many humiliating hours in line only to reach a semi-human who answers your measly question by talking in a cabalistic language: 'I-95, dash, point 6, dash, B-52.' \\" (Mr. Zagalsky was referring to the agency's complex numbered forms.)   Many of the agency's own employees, interviewed in roundtable discussions at district offices across the country, openly ridiculed some of the agency's efforts to serve its clients. And almost without exception, the employees said nothing had improved for them since Bill Clinton took office -- in client service or any of the agency's other fields of responsibility.   \\"There've been changes, but it's not really better,\\" Mr. Waters said. \\"We're falling even farther behind.\\"   But the Commissioner of Immigration and Naturalization, Doris M. Meissner, said that she and others were struggling to improve. They are trying, for example, to promote the idea that immigrants should be treated with \\"humanity and respect,\\" as Ms. Gorelick said. Ms. Meissner has directed officials to stop calling immigrants \\"aliens\\" and to practice \\"enforcement with a heart.\\"   T. Alexander Aleinikoff, who became the agency's general counsel in March, said, \\"I go around telling people: 'This is not the Deportation and Detention Service. This is the Immigration and Naturalization Service.' \\"   But as with all the agency's problems, the leaders are dealing with an internal culture that may be difficult to change.   One senior official at headquarters, for instance, rolled his eyes at the idea that \\"illegal alien\\" was no longer an acceptable term. He asked, \\"What are we supposed to call them, 'out-of-status visitors' ?\\" The System 10 Years In the Wrong Line     On their first days on the job, immigration employees learn that efficiency is usually the goal, not the reality. They confront mountains of paper files, and they inherit backlog upon backlog. In the meager training courses that only some of them attend, many only skim the surface of the very complicated laws they will administer. And they are taught to be vigilant about the deceitful practices of immigrants.   Overworked and guarded, they can make mistakes. And when they do, it can take months to correct them, if not years. Michael and Corazon Graves of Newark, Calif., believe they are paying a high price for what they see as the agency's willful refusal to correct its own error. In essence, an immigration official mistakenly told them to wait in the wrong line, and that line was 10 years long.   On May 13, 1982, an immigration examiner in San Francisco approved Mr. Graves's petition to sponsor his stepdaughter, a Filipino, for an immigrant visa. With that, he placed the stepdaughter, Maria Isabel Cruz, at the end of a long waiting list for prospective Filipino immigrants.   In 1992, the year Ms. Cruz and her three sons were finally due to arrive, Mr. and Mrs. Graves completed an addition to their home for them. Half a world away, Ms. Cruz thought her final interview, with United States consular officials in Manila, would be little more than a formality.   She was wrong. She emerged from the interview in tears, her mother said. The consular officials denied her a visa because the I.N.S. had made a mistake in approving the original petition. A stepfather, it turned out, cannot sponsor a stepchild who was married before the age of 18, as Ms. Cruz was. The Graves were unaware of this fine point of immigration law, and the examiner who approved their petition had either failed to read it thoroughly or had not known this herself.   The Graves should have been advised in 1982 that only Mrs. Graves, who is 50, had the right to sponsor her child. But they were not, and so they were told 10 years later to start from the beginning, returning to the bottom of another decadelong waiting list.   \\"We were in a state of shock,\\" said Mr. Graves, a carpenter.   He hired a lawyer, who requested humanitarian parole for Ms. Cruz. That would have allowed her to enter the country and wait here for her visa. The parole was denied, in a letter from the district director in Thailand, who acknowledged that \\"the facts presented are certainly unfortunate.\\"   Crying, Mrs. Graves said, \\"Sometimes I wonder, 'Will I still be alive by the time my daughter gets her papers?' \\" Record Keeping Filed Away In a Hodgepodge     The I.N.S. lost Jusuf Becovic's file in 1992 but refused to acknowledge it for almost two years. Every few weeks, Mr. Becovic's lawyer, Diane George, would call about the file, and an agency employee would say they were still searching for it. Finally, Mr. Becovic, a building superintendent in Manhattan, sued the agency.   After 10 months of litigation in Federal court and the intercession of two Congressional offices, the agency created a new file for Mr. Becovic, a Montenegro-born immigrant, and his wife, Hatidza. With that, he and his wife were finally able to renew their work authorization.   \\"For two years, I had to keep it secret from my company\\" that his work card had expired, Mr. Becovic said. \\"I would be fired.\\"   Problems like this have their roots in a record-keeping system that combines 44 million paper files with a hodgepodge of more than a half-dozen outdated computer systems that cannot talk to each other.   Despite almost 20 years of consultants' studies, promises and plans, the I.N.S. still does not have a unified computer record-keeping system. It maintains only one very basic central index system, and even that is incomplete.   Over the last two decades, different branches of the agency have cobbled together their own computer networks, as have a few of the 33 district offices. But none of these networks can communicate with the others. So an agency worker checking an immigrant's record in one system has no way to know whether there are other records in another system -- showing, for instance, that an applicant for residency has a criminal history.   \\"If we had automation, we would double or triple our work,\\" said Robert Reed, a supervisory special agent in Los Angeles. In his office, agents still use manual typewriters and carbon paper.   The automation problem slows nearly every service the agency tries to offer. Officials across the country say they waste hours hunting through paper files and the various computer systems to settle immigrants' cases. That in turn lengthens the endemic backlogs -- like the 480 days it takes to become a citizen in San Francisco, according to the American Immigration Lawyers Association. Ordinarily, it should not take more than a few months.   The agency's central index system in particular contains much information that is incorrect or incomplete.   Last year, California and several other states asked the I.N.S. to review the files of 3.6 million immigrants applying for welfare and other benefits. It turned out that about 18 percent of these people, or 650,000, were not even listed in the central index, an omission that should have meant that they were in this country illegally. Before denying them benefits, however, the states pushed for more information, and found out that nearly all were here legally.   Ms. Meissner acknowledges the computer problem and says she has persuaded the Clinton Administration to remedy it. On Aug. 30, the agency signed a $300 million contract for new computer equipment, the largest such contract in the agency's history. By 1996, the immigration service hopes to merge all its data into three integrated computer systems.   But this is not the first time the agency has tried to solve the problem, nor the first contract it has signed for new computer equipment. Longtime I.N.S. employees wonder whether these plans will turn out any better than the agency's many failed efforts of the past. Attitudes  Unpleasantness As the Norm     Immigration officers learn to be hard-nosed in their first days at the agency's academy in Glynco, Ga.   During basic training, \\"we historically have told our employees that it's our job to keep them out and our job to keep them from getting benefits,\\" said Tom Farris, an assistant district director in Chicago.   The training inculcates an intrinsic suspicion of immigrants, some I.N.S. officers say. This often translates into rudeness and even vindictiveness, Mr. Farris acknowledged. It can create an atmosphere in some immigration offices that Maria Valencia, a Filipino immigrant in Virginia, described as a \\"sea of unpleasantness.\\"   While not totally out of place for law-enforcement officers on the border, this attitude creates problems when displayed by examiners reviewing routine applications. It has prompted many critics of the agency and even friends of it to suggest that it should be split in two -- a service side and a law-enforcement division. But Ms. Meissner says she believes that the agency's \\"cultural cleavage\\" can be bridged.   Some local offices are already trying to do that. The agency's 33 district directors run fiefs. They make their own rules, often quite different from one place to the next, and set the tone. In Chicago, Mr. Moyer is the host of a weekly television show in Spanish about immigrants' rights. He says he has found it trying, but possible, to buck the entrenched mentality.   \\"When I first got here to Chicago, we had agents who would brag about their weekend raids on Spanish-language movie theaters, and how all the Mexicans would be jumping out of the balconies,\\" Mr. Moyer said. \\"I have worked hard to try to correct that. We do no more neighborhood raids. Our enforcement is as strong as exists, but we go about it differently.\\"   In Baltimore, the district managers say they demand that immigrants be treated with respect. So it was no coincidence that Wiltrude Rasmussen, a Baltimore deportation officer, took a closer look at the seemingly straightforward deportation case of Adilio Diaz.   A 25-year-old Salvadoran, Mr. Diaz applied for political asylum in 1987. He settled in Maryland and hired a lawyer, Guillermo Diaz-Fontana, who kept assuring him that his case was going well.   Nothing could have been further from the truth. His lawyer, who later pleaded guilty to Federal fraud charges, had already lost the asylum case, and Mr. Diaz had already been ordered deported. He just didn't know it. So one day in December 1990, Mr. Diaz, who said he had paid his lawyer about $1,250, arrived at the Baltimore I.N.S. office, hoping to be told he could have a green card. He left in handcuffs.   When Mr. Diaz's new lawyer, Alison Brown, of the Washington firm of Maggio & Kattar, filed a motion to reopen the case, the I.N.S. did not oppose it","excerpt":"the deportation officer, Mrs. Rasmussen, said she was already suspicious of the first lawyer. The judge reopened Mr. Diaz's case, and, at 6 P.M. on Dec. 22, Mr. Diaz was released from a prison in rural Maryland, 120 miles from his home. He had no money because the Government had issued him a check for his cash -- only about $6, in any case -- and the banks were closed.   Officially, the agency had no further responsibility for Mr. Diaz. But David Talley, supervisor of the detention unit, said: \\"I couldn't put him out on the street that way. It just seemed cruel.\\"   So Mr. Talley drove Mr. Diaz home, a five-hour round trip, just in time for Christmas with his family.   Mr. Diaz still lives in suburban Washington and works at a skilled job as a rug repairman. His lawyer, Ms. Brown, said the case offered an important lesson.   \\"It goes to show,\\" she said, \\"that you can be a human being, that you can handle enforcement of the immigration laws without an attitude that every alien must be thrown out.\\" Chaos at the Gates    SUNDAY: Immigration agency is mismanaged; its ranks, demoralized.

Then you come to the vine-covered mansion and its private chapel, built in 1671, where members of the Guedes family have always lived. It was here, in 1860, that Dom Manuel Pedro Guedes da Silva da Fonseca introduced modern techniques to Portuguese grape growers and laid the foundation of one of the country's principal wine empires.   The Quinta da Aveleda Company is the leading exporter of bottled vinho verde, or green wine, a light effervescent wine with low alcoholic content, which is only produced in Portugal.

The Galactica is a spaceship, but it does not feel particularly space-age. The communication panels on the walls were scavenged from a Canadian destroyer","excerpt":"the desk lamps are from Ikea. If you have seen ''Battlestar Galactica,'' which began its second season on the Sci Fi Channel on Friday, you will know that this Galactica only vaguely resembles the ship that previously bore that name, when ''Battlestar Galactica'' first flew on prime time in 1978, square in the shadow of ''Star Wars.'' And it certainly does not resemble the Enterprise, the ''Star Trek'' vehicle that has defined the visual and thematic vocabulary of television science fiction for four decades. On the Galactica, there is no captain's chair; there are no windows full of stars. The command center is busy and dark, protected deep within the ship the way it would be on an actual military vessel. As the actors move from room to room, hand-held cameras swoop behind them, closing in on them claustrophobically. The characters do not travel heroically from planet to planet, solving the problems of aliens. There are, in fact, no aliens at all.    To be fair, though, there are androids. As in the original show, the humans of the Galactica and its fleet are relentlessly pursued by evil robots called Cylons. But in the current version, conceived by Ronald D. Moore and David Eick, most of the evil Cylons look like people and have found God. Ruthlessly principled and deeply religious, the Cylons have been compared by fans and critics both to Al Qaeda and to the evangelical right. And the humans they are relentlessly pursuing are fallible and complex. Their shirts are not clingy or color-coded; the men of space wear neckties. They are led by Edward James Olmos as the Galactica's commander and Mary McDonnell as the president of the humans, and their stories revolve as much around the tensions within -- between the military and civil leadership of the fleet -- as they do around the Cylon threat. As Eick described the show to me last month with evident, subversive pleasure, ''The bad guys are all beautiful and believe in God, and the good guys all [expletive] each other over.'' Moore, who is also the show's head writer, put it more simply: ''They are us.''

Three components of the fan that were based on patents intended for the aircraft industry enabled it to circulate an elongated spiral pattern of air: rear intake cones that funneled air in a rotary motion, a deep-pitch propeller that generated greater air volume and distance, and an aerodynamic cowl that channeled air against the blades, forcing the maximum amount of air into the room while keeping noise to a minimum. To demonstrate this vortex-tornado phenomenon, salesmen would place a lighted cigarette behind the fan, and onlookers would marvel at the twisting tube of smoke as it came out the other side.

Leading lives rooted in poverty, ignorance and racial animosity, they share a despair and frustration that is almost apocalyptic in its scope.   One of the triumphs of David Willinger's masterly dramatization of the novel, at Theater for the New City through Sunday, is the way he builds many interwoven vignettes into a hallucinatory mosaic of a community suffocating in its own wretchedness and cruelty. Using slides, pantomime and artful spotlighting, Mr. Willinger has staged the novel as a flashing cinematic nightmare. An ensemble of 13 actors conveys the characters' dreams, fantasies and frustrations in an expressionistic style that hits explosive peaks.

Even with Carl Banks out with a damaged left wrist, no other National Football League team has a pride of linebackers quite like them. Lawrence Taylor still defines the outside linebacker. And now Pepper Johnson has emerged as a force.   \\"Don't put him in Canton yet,\\" said Bill Parcells, the Giants' coach, \\"but Pepper's playing as good as anybody we got.\\"   Parcells understands linebackers. In college he was a Wichita State linebacker. As a New England Patriots assistant, he tutored their linebackers. As the Giants' defensive coordinator, he inherited Harry Carson, Brad Van Pelt and Brian Kelley, then blended Taylor with them. He drafted Banks in the first round. He molded Gary Reasons into his signal-caller. He developed Johnson. He traded for Steve DeOssie and Johnie Cooks.     \\"Coach Parcells loves linebackers,\\" Cooks said. \\"Everything you like to do as a linebacker, he lets you do.\\"   \\"We've always had good linebackers,\\" Taylor said. \\"But now some of our defensive linemen are playing well and we've got the best secondary since I've been here. That makes the linebackers even better.\\"   \\"Parcells lets us play,\\" Reasons said. \\"The coaches teach you so you know what's happening, then they let you play.\\"   \\"Parcells makes sure,\\" Johnson said, \\"that linebackers are showcased a lot more here than with other teams.\\"   But the Giant linebackers showcase themselves, as Pepper Johnson did with the big play Monday night, when the Giants joined the San Franciso 49ers to be the only two N.F.L. teams to get off to an 8-0 start in the same season since 1934. That year, the Chicago Bears with Bronko Nagurski were 13-0 before losing the N.F.L. title to the Giants in the \\"sneaker game\\" at the icy Polo Grounds","excerpt":"the Detroit Lions were 10-0 before losing their last three games, two of them to the Bears.   Just before halftime Monday night, Johnson, who is 6 feet 3 inches and 248 pounds, had what he later described as a \\"little confrontation\\" with Kevin Call.   \\"He pushed me in my face,\\" Johnson said of the 6-7, 307-pound offensive tackle. \\"I pushed him back. I told him I'd pick up the pace on him in the second half.\\"   When the Colts, trailing by 17-7, still had a chance, Johnson crashed past Call, jarred the ball loose from Jeff George, the Colts' rookie quarterback, then watched Dave Duerson hurry 31 yards into the end zone with the fumble recovery for the touchdown that assured a 24-7 victory.   \\"Jeff George was rolling away from me,\\" Johnson said, \\"but all I needed was for him to slow down one second, and he did. But the play wasn't complete unless we pick up the ball like Dave did.\\"   With Banks out, Pepper Johnson sometimes has lined up as the outside left linebacker, other times at his usual position of inside right linebacker, next to L. T., where Harry Carson roamed.   \\"L. T. tells me I'm really filling the gap with Harry gone,\\" Johnson said. \\"Harry left me his throne. When he comes around, he'll say: 'Son, you're doing a lot of what I told you to do. You slowed down. You got the kid out of you.' \\"   \\"Harry would probably take all the credit,\\" he added, laughing, \\"but I just want to give him 35 percent.\\"   Johnson, according to Parcells, has been more determined to be efficient and consistent in his fifth season since being drafted on the second round out of Ohio State.    \\"What makes players better is their ability to react,\\" the Giants' coach said. \\"But what makes reaction better is anticipation. Pepper's looking for keys now instead of the coaches having to tell him the keys. We expect our weak-side linebacker to be up there in tackles and he's got a lot.\\"     Of all the Giant defenders, Johnson has been in on the most tackles this season: 58, with 35 solos and 23 assists. Greg Jackson, a safety, is second with 49 (including 39 solos), followed by Taylor with 38 and DeOssie with 35.   \\"I knew this season I had to make a turnaround,\\" Johnson said.\\"We've got some old veterans that would like to have a Super Bowl ring, like Johnie Cooks and Everson Walls, and the only way to get it is if the defense picks up.\\"   But if the Giants are to remain undefeated for their Dec. 3 showdown with the 49ers in San Francisco, they must pick up the pace in the second half of their season, beginning Sunday against the Los Angeles Rams in Anaheim, Calif.   \\"We won't be looking past the Rams,\\" Johnson said. \\"They beat us twice last season.\\"   As a baby, Thomas (Pepper) Johnson got his nickname when an aunt noticed him putting pepper on his cereal. \\"I only did that once,\\" he said, laughing. \\"I put sugar on my cereal now. Or I buy sweetened cereals.\\"   But in the Giants' pride of linebackers, Pepper is putting pepper in the other team's eyes.

Two wineries in central Chile, both within an hour's drive of Santiago, offer free tours. They are Concha y Toro and Undurraga, set in a rich valley with vineyards and fruit orchards. Concha y Toro, founded in 1883, actually has 10 vineyards throughout central Chile. Its showcase vineyard is at a former hacienda in Pirque, about 18 miles southeast of Santiago, and is open daily from 10 A.M. to 1 P.M. and 3 to 6 P.M. A souvenir shop sells wine by the glass, and another shop, closed Monday, sells wine by the bottle. While tours are available in several languages, it is advisable to call at 850-1407 or 850-0007 to arrange for an English-speaking guide if you need one.    The Undurraga winery, founded in 1885, is in Talagante, 21 miles southwest of Santiago. It is open Monday to Friday from 9:30 A.M. to 3 P.M. Visitors are shown around by Pedro Undurraga, one of the owners, who is fluent in English. Visitors are shown the process of bottling and labeling.  There is also a visit to the winery's park, known for its variety of South American trees. The winery recommends a call a day ahead of a planned visit at 817-2346.   Travel companies in Santiago offer tours to the each winery (but not to both in one tour), by private car with a guide fluent in most languages. One company is Tour Service (696-0415). Its tour of the Concha y Toro winery also takes in the neighboring Cajon del Maipo region (the canyon of the Maipo River) in the lower slopes of the Andes. The cost is $57 for the car, which will hold up to four. One tour leaves Santiago at 9:30 A.M. and returns at around 2 P.M. Another leaves Santiago at 2 P.M. and returns by 6 P.M. The tour of the Undurraga winery costs about $61 and also includes a walk through Pomaire, known for its ceramics and other crafts. Two other Santiago companies with similar tours are Turismo Cocha (698-3341) and Expor Travel (698-5241). The Mystery of Point Baker    Q.     On an Aeroflot flight from Leningrad to Kiev our tickets were written as Leningrad-Point Baker. There was great confusion in Leningrad about Point Baker and we almost didn't get on the Kiev flight. No one I have asked since knows what Point Baker means. Is it some kind of code? -- Gloria Charney, Dobbs Ferry, N.Y.      A.  Point Baker is no code but a real place in southeast Alaska. It does have an airport, but gets flights from places like Ketchikan and Whale Pass, and certainly not from Leningrad. The probable explanation for Point Baker's appearing on your ticket lies in airport codes, the three-letter combinations that appear on luggage tags and are entered in computers when writing plane tickets.  Your flight from Leningrad was to one of Kiev's two airports, Borispol, code letters KBP. Point Baker's code is KPB. Your ticket was written by your travel agent, who may have transposed the last two letters. If she had, the computer would have printed Point Baker instead of Kiev on your ticket. Your agent said that your tickets, with a number of stops, were complicated, so she wrote the fares on them manually rather than using her computer. Therefore, the computer would not have indicated that Leningrad-Point Baker was unlikely or impossible. In any case, your name was on Aeroflot's list of passengers, and you did get to Kiev.  Scotland on Foot    Q.     We would like to take hikes in Scotland and spend nights in hotels or country inns. Do you know of companies that organize such hikes? -- Eugen E. Pacher, Pattenburg, N.J.     A.  There are a number of British companies that offer such walks in Scotland with overnight stays in inns, hotels, bed and breakfasts or even a castle. Luggage is usually moved from one lodging to the next by motor vehicle.

Ortolan is a tiny bird native to the southwest of France and are traditionally roasted and eaten in one bite, head, beak, bones and all.

A.Until well into the 20th century astronomers could not be sure there were any galaxies other than our own, but they had long been aware of a great many glowing fuzzy objects, called nebulae. In 1924 the astronomer Edwin Hubble was able to resolve the outer sections of a nearby spiral nebula into individual stars, and in 1944 Walter Baade did the same for two others. It seemed clear from these observations that a great many nebulae were likely to turn out to be other galaxies, and so they have, as telescopes grew larger and observations more acute. Individual stars still cannot be seen in galaxies billions of light years away, but astronomers assume that objects at great distances that look much the same as nearby nebulae used to look are in fact galaxies.

Daniel, a year and a half into the race, has finally hit its stride.    \\"Four stars?\\" asks a friend one morning. It is 8 A.M., and he is calling to say thank you for the dinner we finished a mere seven hours earlier.   \\"I have never had a better dinner,\\" he says, dreamily recalling ethereal linguine topped with slender shavings of white truffle. \\"If I concentrate,\\" he adds, \\"I can still smell the truffles and feel those noodles dissolving in my mouth like gossamer ribbons. What a meal!\\"   \\"Can't we talk later?\\" I ask crossly. But he is busy remembering a veloute filled with plump caviar-topped oysters, butter-drenched leeks and sea urchin roe. The voluptuous flavors were rich and decadent, so that the hint of lemongrass in the cream soup combined with the bracing taste of caviar to deliver a gentle shock. \\"It was perfect!\\" my friend insists. \\"Aren't you going to give them four stars?\\"   \\"I don't know,\\" I say. \\"I have to go back a few more times.\\"   \\"But was there anything wrong with the meal?\\" he wants to know. I pull the covers over my head and think for a moment. I hope he'll hang up. No such luck.   \\"They were nice to me when I walked in the door,\\" he says, \\"and it was abundantly clear that I was not one of their regular customers. All my clothes put together did not cost as much as one of those custom-made shirts the other men were wearing. And although neither of us had a single piece of jewelry, the hostess could not have been more welcoming.\\"   \\"Didn't you think the bar we waited in was awfully small and crowded?\\" I ask. \\"Our knees were hitting those of the people next to us. I thought it was uncomfortable.\\"   \\"O.K.,\\" he admits, \\"it was small. But they made up for it by bringing out that plate of lovely little cheese puffs.\\"   \\"They're called gougeres,\\" I can't resist saying.   \\"Whatever,\\" he says. \\"They were delicious. And we only had to wait seven minutes for our table. I timed it.\\"   \\"But didn't you think the dining room was awfully noisy?\\" I persist grumpily.    He has to concede the point","excerpt":"the dining room was crowded, and noisier than it should have been. \\"On the other hand,\\" he reminds me, \\"you said you thought the flowers were fabulous.\\"   They were. The drama of the flower arrangements dominates the restaurant, transforming a bland beige room into a place with personality. There are no windows, but the flowers announce the seasons and set the stage for the food with designs so spectacular you find yourself rushing in the door to look at them.    \\"And you liked the service,\\" he prods. He is right about that, too: the service that night was smooth and sweet, more like that in a stately mansion than a large restaurant. It was formal, thoughtful and not at all stuffy. The waiter passed the amuses gueules as if he were serving at a dinner party, urging us to eat the tiny crab spring rolls and mushroom toasts while they were still hot. One day at lunch, two Brazilian runners were seated at the next table. Before they had finished their meal, the waiter had not only offered tips for tourists in New York, but also convinced them that Daniel would be the perfect place to carbo-load before the marathon; the chef, he assured them, would be happy to create some special pasta dishes.   \\"Remember the nine-herb ravioli?\\" my friend asks now. Who could forget it? The floppy squares of pasta were filled with a bright green puree of herbs and painted with a vivid red coulis. Colorful leaves of herbs were scattered across the top with fragrant bits of toasted pine nuts and shavings of cheese.   \\"And the wild hare stew?\\" he asks. At that I sit up and sniff the air. I do remember the civet de lievre. Its deep red wine sauce was thickened with blood and a touch of chocolate; it was so rich and exotic I was seduced into taking one bite and then another as I tried to chase the flavors back to their source. Served with a puree of chestnuts and the roasted loin stuffed with porcini mushrooms, the stew was a masterpiece of hearty regional cooking.    Daniel Boulud was, for 6 years, the much-acclaimed chef at Le Cirque, but in his own restaurant he is working with a new confidence. He seems to be cooking for himself with a menu that offers both hearty French food and classic cooking so technically proficient it takes your breath away.   Chilled lobster consomme is a tour de force. The soup is as clear as crystal but so expressive of lobster that if you close your eyes and take a bite you are surprised to find your mouth filled with liquid. The soup, decorated with rounds of lobster topped with creme fraiche and caviar, is dotted with coral cream when it is served. This is an astonishing dish worthy of a temple of haute cuisine. Still, if you want to continue with a less complicated course, you could order something as down-to-earth as tripes gratinees, hearty cuisine bourgeoise that would be at home in a great country bistro.    Mr. Boulud also offers a changing celebration of the seasons: daily specials that depend on little more than great ingredients. One might be the simple luxury of a large yellow potato mashed with lots of butter and fresh truffles, another an abundance of porcini sauteed in clarified butter, sprinkled with bits of rock salt and a small shower of herbs.   \\"And wasn't that foie gras fantastic?\\" my friend asks, reminding me of the way the unctuous liver had been balanced by the austerity of fresh quince. Fully awake at last, I begin to revel in last night's dinner as my friend and I start shouting the names of dishes, giddily recapturing a cornucopia of flavors.   \\"Pumpkin soup!\\" I say, recalling the bright orange puree anchored by a small mound of grated squash topped with black trumpet mushrooms, tiny bits of bacon and crunchy little pumpkin seeds.   \\"Steamed skate!\\" he cries, and in my mind I can see a broth the color of clover, and feel the way the corduroy texture of the fish was emphasized by the soft lobster dumplings in watercress-lobster broth.   \\"Quail salad!\\" I say, thinking about a lunch when I was served the most appealing salad I can remember. Leaves of mache were topped with a pair of tiny fried quail eggs and laced with velvety strips of foie gras, silky pieces of grilled quail breast and rough shavings of Parmesan cheese.   \\"And the wine!\\" my friend says, reminding me of the sommelier's suggestions from that list of fabulous and fabulously expensive bottles. We had settled on a '91 Chassagne-Montrachet from Colin followed by a wonderfully plummy '89 Bon Pasteur.   \\"Desserts,\\" my friend says now, almost reverently. Together we recite the sweets of the evening, like children recalling Halloween treats. I liked a fruit soup that looked like a reverse sunset, a mint green verbena ice-cream sun setting in a magenta wine-poached pear. He liked the gratin of chocolate, a slim disk of warm chocolate on a fragile sugar wafer. We both loved the creme brulee with macerated strawberries, and were charmed by the finale, a plate of petits fours with its fanciful pulled-sugar birds and flowers.   \\"So?\\" says my friend. \\"Four stars?\\"   \\"It was a great meal,\\" I concede, pushing back the covers, \\"but I still have to go back and see if Daniel can sustain that level of cooking.\\"   Five meals later, it is clear that the restaurant can. I have had an occasional disappointment: a salty soup, a 15-minute wait for dinner, a lost reservation at lunch. But even on an off day, the restaurant is so exciting that you wake up the morning after a meal at Daniel eager to remember every bite.   It's quite a ride.

DINING OUT;\\nFrench Provincial Decor in Banksville"},{"year":"1999","title":"1. One of the most stylish black rooms of the 20th century -- the hall at Folly Farm, in Berkshire, England -- was done not by a decorator but by an architect. Sir Edwin Lutyens (1869-1944) is widely admired for his bold reinterpretation of Renaissance classicism, and this 1912 room is no exception. Glossy black walls are framed by white enamel-painted woodwork, while the balcony is painted red to match the lacquered cabinet below it. Lutyens is probably best known for his romantic country houses, some of which have gardens by the legendary Gertrude Jekyll. But he also designed the British Embassy in Washington and the Viceroy's House in New Delhi. Lutyens's smallest although certainly not least important project was a gift he designed for Queen Mary in the early 1920's -- a doll house, with flush toilets, electricity and working elevators.    2. Classic black and white, but from a slightly different source, adorns the bedroom of Oatsie Charles's guest house in Newport, R.I. Mrs. Charles was a longtime client of Dr. Erno Laszlo, the skin-care guru. The rooms in Laszlo's Fifth Avenue clinic were painted black with white trim. ''I told him I didn't know whether his treatments really worked or not, but that everyone who came into these rooms immediately fell asleep, they were so restful,'' recalls Mrs. Charles. So she painted her guest room accordingly, but cautions that straight black won't do. Adding some purple, she explains, results in ''a three-dimensional quality.''    3. As a decorating concept, black has deep historical roots. After Rome burned in 64 A.D., the emperor Nero (37 A.D.-68 A.D.) built a sprawling palace, the Domus Aurea, on the ruins of the charred city. One room, the room of the black vault, was lavishly decorated with black panels that framed miniature paintings. Nero's unpopularity assured that most of the Domus Aurea was buried after his death and ''redeveloped'' by subsequent emperors.    4. The lure of a black wall was irresistible to the decorator Dorothy Draper (1889-1969), who was, in the 1940's, as well known as Eleanor Roosevelt. Her style, a sort of insouciant Baroque rendered in vibrant colors, survives at the Greenbrier Hotel, in West Virginia, but much of her work fell victim to changing tastes. Draper's elegant exuberance is evident here in one of the public rooms at the Essex House Hotel (a). Draper's own apartment at the Carlyle Hotel (b), rendered in this watercolor by the decorator Mark Hampton, was painted a deep eggplant color (although Hampton depicted it as dark gray). It was loaded with family antiques and her signature rose-patterned chintz.    5. Charleston is the English farmhouse that became the country retreat for the artistic circle known as Bloomsbury. The artist Vanessa Bell, Virginia Woolf's sister, settled there with her companion, the painter Duncan Grant, in 1916. They turned the house into a beehive of artistic activity, particularly for the Omega Workshops, the collective founded by the painter and critic Roger Fry, a constant visitor. Much of the decorating was done by Bell, Grant and members of their extended artistic family","excerpt":"the dining-room walls were wallpapered black, then stenciled by Grant and Quentin Bell, Vanessa's son, in a gray-and-yellow pattern.    6. A classic magazine page: the November 1942 issue of House and Garden shows the living room of Katharine Brush, a novelist popular at the time. Black-brown walls serve as a foil for bleached oak furniture and pale fabrics and leathers, and accents ''in coral and russet tones.''    7. A recent project by the French designer-of-the-moment, Christian Liaigre, is this house in Bangkok, with dark-wood room dividers. Black, maintains Liaigre, ''is a perfect color to use in Asia, because the light there is very, very strong.''

With deft, swift movements, she conveys the authority of a person who has wrenched a living out of the land. Cutting hay, digging or hoeing, washing laundry in a stream, slicing meat, she makes us momentarily forget all the worldly or urban roles that she has played so superbly—here, she's the total peasant.Hard work and hard times have armored the widow against almost any form of indulgence. Hence Miss Signoret is also very touching as a stern, aging woman who falls reluctantly in love with a footloose young man. As in some of her other movies, there's the hopeful half-smile that appears when she likes someone, or the wistful appreciation that she reveals after making love.The man also sleeps with a mindless adolescent (Ottavia Piccolo—very good.) Then the widow's in-laws, who hate her, identify him to the police. The movie was adapted from a novel by Georges Simenon","excerpt":"the director is respectful of its characters, and their situation might even have the stuff of tragedy. However, Mr. Delon's role and his performance are too thin and elusive—so we can't care greatly when his life's in jeopardy.The actor just doesn't use the vitality that he has brought to some of his earlier parts; instead, he's almost phlegmatic, and—not for the first time—he seems to be thinking of James Dean. (A nice thought, admittedly, but one that's hardly rooted in the French working class.) Since Miss Signoret has all the strength to move us, it's worth wishing that the director had made her opposite number more substantial.

If \\"Doctor in the House\\" does not probe deeply into character or medicine, it is, at least, a carrier of contagious chuckles and a few belly laughs.Perhaps this ribald, carefree, and sometimes rough road to-ward a doctorate might give birth to misconceptions here, but suffice it to say that Richard Gordon, the nom de plume of the author of the book from which this comedy stems, Is a London medico and he, naturally, should remember the symptoms. At any rate, the bare bones of his plot support the fragile tissue of four students' trials and tribulations, as well as their effects on the nurses, professors and sundry citizens within their orbit during five years of training.This, as has been noted, is merely the integument. The guts of this airy adventure is in the pointed and often truly funny script contributed by Nicholas Phipps—he also doubles in brass in a small bit as a magistrate—and the brisk directorial job turned in by Ralph Thomas. Their heroes, who occupy a midden's nest of a flat, are not, as might be guessed, drawn to standard specifications. There is Dirk Bogarde, the serious chap who is taken in tow by Kenneth More, Who repeatedly fails his examinations. This, it appears, is his happily adopted way of life, since under- his grand-mother's will his allowance will stop if he leaves medical school. Then there is Donald Sinden, handsome, cheerful and not especially bright, who drools like Pavlov's dogs at the sight of each pretty, nubile nurse. And there is the athletic Welshman, Donald Houston, who is more devoted to rugby football than physiology.Romance, as might be expected, is part and parcel of their regimen. Suzanne Cloutier makes a fetching, if unusual, fiancée of Mr. More, who is as much at home with all of his friends as she is with him. There also is Muriel Pavlow, the cute nurse who falls for the Mr. Bogarde. And there is, among others, Kay Kendall (remembered as the striking, trumpet-playing fashion model of \\"Genevieve\\"), who appears briefly.Last, but certainly not least, are the veteran medicos upon whom the task of teaching lies heavily. In this category, James Robertson Justice, a heavily bearded bear of a man, who, as an eminent Harley Street surgeon, is gruff with his pupils but fondly remembers student days. His explosive instructions make for the film's outstanding portrayal.In short, the unreconstructed tyros at this London hospital seem to be ignoring in advance that portion of the Hippocratic Oath that has to do with abstaining \\"from whatever is deleterious and mischievous.\\" But the producer, Betty E. Box","excerpt":"the director, the scenarist and the capable men handling the Technicolor cameras have come up with a somewhat thin and contrived comedy, but one which is as light-hearted and happy as a man finally receiving that coveted M.

Because they are invisible to the human eye, the new inks can be placed anywhere on a package without interfering with the package design. More information can be added and the codes could be printed on all sides of a package, so that the information could be read regardless of the orientation of the container, speeding customers through the supermarket check-out lines. More information could also help stores keep better track of their inventories and help shippers keep track of their shipments.    \\"Several bar codes on a product could provide an enormous amount of information during the inventory, manufacturing and shipping processes,\\" said B.

Now, it appears, the tides are turning once more: the conventional dining room is disappearing.   The American dining room as a separate entity is a newer concept than most people think. It wasn't until the mid-19th century that dining rooms appeared on plan books as a main room. In simple Colonial houses, families ate in the kitchen. In somewhat more elaborate homes before 1800, there were eating rooms, as they were called, but they also doubled as sitting rooms. Only in large houses, like the plantation houses of the South or wealthy merchant homes in the North, was there a room of its own big enough to seat at least 20.

Also in the room, scribbling on a script, was the play's author, Jon Robin Baitz. The two men (following standard rehearsal protocol) spoke to each other only through the director, Doug Hughes, but they were nevertheless fidgeting in sync.      They've had a lot of practice: ''The Paris Letter'' is the fourth play Mr. Baitz has written with Mr. Rifkin in mind. Even so, Mr. Baitz knew that the character he'd created represented the biggest challenge yet to the actor's skills -- and the biggest provocation to their relationship. ''We'd gotten to the point where it couldn't just be more of the same,'' Mr. Baitz said. ''It had to be private, it had to be costly, it had to hurt.'' And so he came up with the role of Sandy Sonnenberg, who (like Isaac Geldhart in ''The Substance of Fire'' and Kenneth Hoyle in ''Three Hotels'' and other Baitz leading men Mr. Rifkin has played) is a cultured, well-married and prosperous businessman facing a moral catastrophe.

It is commonly thought that in a typical psychoanalysis, the analyst eventually discovers, perhaps through a reported dream or a slip of the tongue, what is troubling the unconscious mind of the analysand. The analyst then announces the new-found insight and brings the patient in a single leap to the mountaintop of understanding. Eureka! The sufferer has been cured.   But those who have actually been through analysis report that it is a slow and tortuous process, more like climbing a mountain a few inches at a time, with each tiny step gaining a vantage point to see just a little farther.    In his profound new book, \\"Love and Its Place in Nature: A Philosophic Interpretation of Freudian Psychoanalysis,\\" Jonathan Lear reveals that, surprisingly enough, early in his career, Sigmund Freud held a modified version of the former view. In his deep commitment to a 19th-century scientistic interpretation of the new discipline he was evolving, he believed that hysterics expelled the \\"foreign bodies\\" of their traumatic memories in a process of catharsis that resembled some law of thermodynamics.   It was only later and gradually that he came to understand that some primitive form of mental functioning underlay conscious thought and that it could only be coaxed to the surface gradually by an interpretation just one step ahead of the patient's understanding, not shouted down from the mountaintop, as it were. Moreover, the process of bringing the material to the surface involved not a strictly scientific procedure, but instead a form of love.   What Mr. Lear sees in these discoveries is a revolution that went much further than even Freud himself anticipated. In Mr. Lear's words, this revolution \\"contained three related elements whose significance we have only begun to understand: a science of subjectivity","excerpt":"the discovery of an archaic form of mental functioning; the positing of Love as a basic force in nature.\\" He adds: \\"To take these ideas seriously would be to view the world very differently than we do now.\\" In \\"Love and Its Place in Nature,\\" he strives for that altered world view.   It is not a simple book to read. Aside from being a clinical associate of the Western New England Institute for Psychoanalysis, the author is a professor of philosophy at Yale University and the author of \\"Aristotle: The Desire to Understand\\" and \\"Aristotle and Logical Theory.\\" His thesis is so closely reasoned and rigorously worded that in a footnote in Chapter VI he feels compelled to remind us that \\"I began to discuss the distinction between accepting responsibility and holding responsible in Chapter II,\\" as if his readers can't be expected to remember what they have already read.   The author sticks closely to Freud's own writing, so that his development of the master's ideas is done in the context of such works as \\"Studies in Hysteria,\\" \\"The Interpretation of Dreams,\\" \\"The Ego and the Id,\\" \\"Beyond the Pleasure Principle\\" and \\"Civilization and Its Discontents,\\" as well as many of Freud's less familiar works. Not incidentally, following a suggestion made by Bruno Bettelheim in his book \\"Freud and Man's Soul\\" (Knopf, 1983), he substitutes the words \\"I\\" and \\"it\\" for \\"ego\\" and \\"id,\\" so that Freud's most famous statement reads \\"Where It was, there I shall become.\\"    He explores the philosophical implications of psychoanalysis and compares his conclusions with those of thinkers like Kant and Nietzsche, finding both of them, and others, disappointingly limited in their views of the mind. In general he blames modern philosophy for its \\"tendency to investigate the structure of the human soul in isolation from any consideration of how that structure came about.\\"    But a careful reading of \\"Love and Its Place in Nature\\" yields valuable rewards. He makes one understand how psychoanalysis works not only on the therapist's couch but also as a condition of being alive. He writes: \\"Psychoanalysis, Freud once said, is a cure through love. On the manifest level, Freud meant that psychoanalytic therapy requires the analysand's emotional engagement with the analyst and the analyst's empathic understanding of his patient. But the latent content of this remark, which Freud only gradually discovered, and then through a glass darkly, is that psychoanalysis in its essence promotes individuation. In that sense, psychoanalysis is itself a manifestation of love. And the emergence of psychoanalysis onto the human scene must, from this perspective, be part of love's developmental history.\\"   Is psychoanalysis dying as a practical therapy? Mr. Lear asks in his Introduction. And answers: \\"To my mind, the issue is not whether psychoanalysis is obsolete, but whether the individual is.\\" For all their immense value in relieving human suffering, he writes, \\"there is no evidence that drugs, surgery or electroconvulsive therapy can treat more than the grossest of psychic phenomena. That there will be marvelous advances in neurology and pharmacology is beyond question; that they will solve the conflicts inherent in living    this    particular life is fantasy.\\"   He goes on: \\"And however valuable it may be to jump-start someone out of a depression, from the point of view of our commitment to the individual, the all-important question is: what happens next? Does the person use the relief from crippling pain as an opportunity to work through the meanings and conflicts inherent in his life; or is he 'relieved' of that opportunity? This is ultimately the question of whether a person is freed    to    become an individual -- or 'freed'    from    that possibility.\\"   Mr. Lear disdains self-help books, because \\"selves are not that easy to help.\\" He adds, \\"An individual requires a kind of nurturing and growth that goes far beyond aerobics and quick-fix therapy.\\" Yet \\"Love and Its Place in Nature\\" may be the ultimate self-help book. It not only offers a form of spiritual nutriment for the self, it also defines that self with a clear profundity that few readers will have encountered before.

He was seventy-nine. During his 38-year association with The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Dr. Rutledge helped improve the outlook for thousands of women with gynecologic cancers. He was at the forefront in designing conservative, individualized cancer therapy that extended survival and reduced post-surgical complications. He was born in Anniston, Alabama, on November 20, 1917, the only son of Josie and Felix Noah Rutledge, Sr. He began planning to study medicine as a youth. He received an undergraduate degree at the University of Alabama in 1939 and earned his medical degree at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in 1943. He completed an internship and residence training in three specialty areas at Johns Hopkins Hospital before moving to Houston. Dr. Rutledge joined the M.D. Anderson staff in 1948 on a part-time basis. At that time, patients were seen in temporary quarters on an old family estate while the first hospital facility was being planned and built in the then-new Texas Medical Center. He became the first chairman of the Department of Gynecology when M.D. Anderson opened in 1954 and continued in that post until he retired in 1986. Dr. Rutledge was instrumental in developing the Department of Gynecology at M.D. Anderson into one of the nation's most productive academic training centers. He was widely acclaimed for his work in pelvic exenteration, as well as poineering less radical methods to remove cancers and preserve patient function and body image. In addition to his surgical and teaching skills, Dr. Rutledge designed clinical trials that demonstrated conclusively the superior results of applying multidisciplinary therapy to treat many forms of gynecologic cancer. His research led to extensive publications in leading professional journals and contributions to several textbooks. As a teacher, he personally trained over 100 post-graduate fellows in gynecologic oncology, many of whom have gone on to hold senior academic positions in medical institutions around the world. In 1970, the physicians he trained honored him by establishing the Felix Rutledge Society. The Society's purpose, to share new developments in gynecologic oncology and to stimulate original investigation in gynecologic oncology and to related fields, mirrors Dr. Rutledge's philosophy and values in the practice and art of medicine. A member of all societies of his specialties as well as many other medical societies, Dr. Rutledge served as President of the Society of Gynecologic Oncologists in 1975, President of the American Radium Society in 1976, and President of the Society of Pelvic Surgeons in 1979. He was one of five physicians who created the Subspecialty of Gynecologic Oncology for the American Board of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Dr. Rutledge received many honors and awards throughout his life including the Janeway Medal, American Radium Society (1982)","excerpt":"the Distinguished Service Award, American Cancer Society (1985); the Heath Memorial Award (1985); Fellow of the Society of Scholars, Johns Hopkins University (1994); Honoris Causa in Medicine, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy (1994); Honoris Causa, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain (1997); Honorary Fellow, Royal College of Obstetrics & Gynecology of Great Britain; and Honorary Fellow, Royal College of Obstetrics and Gynecology of South Africa.

Those styles were not always the styles one associates immediately with the composers at hand. Her account of Mendelssohn's Fantasy in F-sharp minor (Op. 28), for example, had an almost Brahmsian weight. Yet it was so passionate and purposeful that to fault it on that ground would be to miss its point.    Mostly, though, her choices of coloration, balance and rhetorical gesture suited the music perfectly. In Beethoven's Six Variations on an Original Theme (Op. 34), her gestures were stately and her ornamentation was a picture of clarity. She gave Gershwin's Three Preludes the folksy rudeness and the bluesy accent that lies at their heart. Of the four Rachmaninoff Etudes-Tableaux Ms. Deane played, the ruminative G minor (Op. 33, No. 7) was the most touching, but each was individually characterized. And her reading of Debussy's \\"Isle Joyeuse\\" made the alternation of vividness and mystery seem easier than it is.

For Ages 6 to 10."},{"year":"1990","title":"EAST of the teeming center of Bangkok, about 45 minutes from the Grand Palace and off the Rajapraprop Road, is a walled lane overgrown with flowering vines and ending in a small cul-de-sac. There, under a large sheltering tree, the entrance flanked by a sleeping dog and strutting rooster, is a plain frame house that looks much like any other here in the Makkasan district. This is the home of Khunying (a title awarded by the king and roughly comparable to the British \\"Companion\\") Tongkorn Chandavimol, her Bangkok Dolls Museum and the company she started nearly 35 years ago, Bangkok Dolls.   Mrs. Chandivamol, a distinguished, vital woman of 73, is still sole owner and still oversees every phase of production -- something she has done since the day she took her \\"personal money\\" to start this cottage industry.   Her interest in doll-making began in 1945 when she was a teacher at Chulalongkorn Pre-university School and accompanied her husband, who was the Minister of Education, on an official visit to Japan. The dolls she saw there were beautifully made and had the scrupulous attention to detail that elevated them to art. Mrs. Chandivamol enrolled in the Ozawa Dolls School in Tokyo for a five-day course, and she returned to Bangkok determined to add collector's dolls to the list of quality Thai art objects. (She was so successful that, according to Paisan Wangsai, the director of tourism for Eastern North America, the Tourism Authority of Thailand gives Bangkok Dolls as gifts to foreign dignitaries.)    It wasn't until 1956 that she made her first doll, the presentation piece for the Queen's birthday","excerpt":"the doll is now on view in the Museum. With Her Majesty's encouragement, Mrs. Chandivamol began Bangkok Dolls. Asked whether, as a woman, it had been difficult for her to start her own business, she said that women are traditionally entrepreneurial here; it was especially easy to begin as a small home industry, then gradually expand as word-of-mouth brought more and more orders.   Khunying Chandavimol does the research, the designs, the seeking out and buying of materials herself. Her lifelike collector's dolls are authentic in costume -- in court dress, Thai period dress or simply contemporary dress -- whether depicting farmers, hill tribe people or figures from classical drama and dance. The antique clothes are based on wall paintings in temples, museum collections and old illustrations. Mrs. Chandavimol uses local suppliers, people who know the quality and type of fabric and trim she wants. Every one of the more than 5,000 dolls produced here annually is entirely handmade from local materials and completed in a day.   Pree Supsomrual, who is both saleswoman and caretaker of the showroom, took me on a tour of the workshops. There are 20 women at work, all \\"family\\" -- children of people who worked for the family as domestics. All of them were trained here and are longstanding employees. (Naree Teekayu, the production manager, started as an assistant 30 years ago.) Each person does a specific job.    Thanamsri Songsang makes legs. She was sewing a silklike synthetic into slim, sheer little stockings, connected to one another by thread. These were stuffed with cotton by a woman at the next table and then passed along to a table laden with cloth bodies stuffed with straw. Here, a U-shaped wire was threaded through each body and into each leg, allowing it to be bent into the required pose; arms are done the same way. Miss Supsomrual said that some dolls had been made with plastic bodies, experimentally, but the results were not satisfactory. The head, however, starts as a bulb-shaped plastic form onto which stiff fabric for the face is glued and then painted.   The doll has to be dressed before the head is attached. Every jewel and sequin is carefully sewn on; every pleat is carefully placed. The difficulty lies in keeping folds and gathers in scale, because these dolls are between 8 and 17 inches high. Sumptuous fabric -- brocade, lame, chiffon, satin, silk -- is guided around each bent arm and leg so that it drapes naturally, and tiny hands clasp tiny objects or each other. Shoe soles are then glued to the feet and the head is screwed onto the body. The doll is placed on its stand, a headdress or hair or both are added and shoes are sewn on. Finally, a tiny \\"Handmade Bangkok Dolls Thailand\\" tag is affixed, which is how you can be assured that you're buying one of Mrs. Chandivamol's very own. Considering the work that goes into the dolls, prices for them are low. They range from 200 bahts, or about $8, for an 8-inch country woman to 780 bahts, or about $32, for a 10-inch Khon figure, then jump to about $60 for a 12-inch Kinnaree, a mythical half-human and half-bird female, and about $72 for a 13-inch Thosaganth, the demon king in all his 10 hands, 4 faces glory.   The Khon dolls are the most striking. Khon is Thai drama performed by masked figures and tells of an episode from the Ramayana, an Indian epic poem. The Thai version is called the Ramakien; parts of it were written by King Rama I, founder of the present dynasty, and his son, Rama II, who was a great patron of the arts and supporter of Khon performance. While the dolls may be bought individually, they are most effective in groups, or at least in pairs. My favorite is the fingernail dancer, the elegantly dressed classical dancer with ultralong gold fingernails, who many think of when Thailand is mentioned. A 12-inch Norah figure -- in a fringed metallic-mesh bodice, arms upraised to an elaborate jeweled headdress and feet in ballet's second position under a skirt of alternating sheer and embroidered panels -- is about $24. A 12-inch Rama-- brandishing a serpentlike staff and resplendent in gold epaulets with red tassels, gold and green brocade breeches and tunic and three red-and-black panels richly embroidered and trimmed with gold hung from a gold belt -- costs about $26. A 12-inch Sida, his wife-- with matching tasseled and jeweled headdress, a gold and white brocade dress and cape lined with red, hands pressed together before her in traditional greeting-- is about $24. Hanuman-- the 10-inch white monkey general, all in white satin with gold accents and trim, his head a marvelous Khon mask, feet apart and knees bent, one arm up and the other at his waist-- costs about $26. Thosaganth, the mask-headed demon king, similar in pose and dress to Rama, is a 13-inch doll that costs about $30; these are the principal figures in the epic.   The dolls cost slightly less when bought in pairs or as a group. Particularly attractive are a 10-inch Hanuman and Nang Madsha, the golden mermaid, for about $62. (An 8-inch mermaid alone is about $27, a 10-inch doll about $32.) A 17-inch trio, Thosaganth against Hanuman and Rama, costs about$82. Ten-inch demons and monkey generals named in the epic are between $24 and $28.   A set of 30 Ramakien dolls costs about $1,400 and up, depending on the size of the dolls. The largest set consists of 50 dolls and costs at least $2,000; but it is rarely made. Indeed, orders for sets and special orders are filled at the discretion of Mrs. Chandivamol, who checks the stock on hand and whether the material is available to make any necessary dolls. In the same way, she decides whether a mail order can be filled. As far as I could tell at my visit, the average order should pose no problem because the difficulty is the customer's -- what to choose from among the great variety of dolls. The company's color brochure shows nearly all of them and is an accurate guide.   There are 15 dolls in hill tribe costume, priced at about $9 for the 8-inch and about $12 or $14 for the 10-inch. The women have the intricate headgear and elaborately embroidered clothing for which the tribes are known; noteworthy are the dolls with colorful yarn-streamer Lisu and beaded-and-silver-coin Akha headdresses. The period dress dolls are all 10 inches tall and cost about $18. They represent four Thai periods (Dvarati, Sukhothai, Ayutthaya, Bangkok) with bejeweled figures in sumptuous fabrics showing the evolution of dress from the 7th to the 20th century. The figures representing country people -- farmers, vendors, musicians and \\"housewives\\" -- are the least expensive but no less detailed; all are 8inches tall and priced at about $8 to $11. Most of these dolls hold something: wicker baskets hung from shoulder yokes, carried on the heads or in the arms, filled with fruit, grain or vegetables; sheaves of grain; farm tools; folk instruments. A group of nine is about $80, a wooden Thai house to complete the setting is about $14. For less than about $4 you can buy a Thai country dress outfit, with woven-straw field hat, for Barbie. There's also a charming Nativity set, unmistakably Thai, for about $80, which would be something different under the Christmas tree.   Mrs. Chandivamol makes another line she calls Cuddley Dolls, which are soft-body cotton cloth dolls ranging in size from 10 to 16 inches and in price from about $13 to $26. They are dressed in heavily detailed, authentic hill tribe jewelry and costumes and reminded me of Walt Disney's Small World figures. I'd fight off any kid who wanted mine. They should be given only to very careful, very appreciative young people. The Cuddley farm mother and child won first prize at the 1982 Bangkok Bicentennial Celebration; a 16-inch mother doll is about $24 and a 10-inch child about $13. The arms and legs are jointed, so mother can hold the baby.   Prices at the workshops are slightly lower than in town; cab fare evens it out, but visitors can watch dolls being made and tour the Museum. Traditional papier mache Khon masks are also made here, handmolded to a form and then painted, taking two weeks to complete: about $6 each.   There is a very charming, inexpensive souvenir that is uniquely Thai and collected by the Thai people themselves: Palace dolls. These one- to two-inch-long clay figurines were made by ladies of the royal household, not as toys but as decorations, until about 100 years ago. With the modernization of Thailand under King Rama V (Chulalongkorn, son of King Mongkut of \\"Anna and the King of Siam\\" aka \\"The King and I\\"), the art disappeared. According to Phaitoon Paga of the Office of Royal Secretary of the King, Queen Sirikit was responsible for the revival 10 years ago of these dolls. She was on an official visit to the Pamok District outside Bangkok, where the villagers had turned to brickmaking after rice crop failures. She suggested they make the dolls to supplement their earnings since the dolls are made of the same material, clay.   Palace dolls are strictly a home industry. Three parts clay are mixed with one part paper and hand-modeled into the little figures. They are left to dry and then fired in the cooking stove. The family rice pot is put on the burner, the dolls are popped into the oven underneath and when the dinner rice is done, so are the dolls. They are then painted with oils in typical Thai everyday dress and depict everyday activities, like children at play or a band of musicians. The prices are very modest, about 20 to 30 cents. They are sold at Chitralada shops, outlets for Support, the Government foundation whose objective is to revive the old crafts and through them supply villagers with an additional source of income. You can see doll-making demonstrations in the old capital, Ayutthaya, at the Government center run by Support.  WHERE TO FIND AND ORDER THE DOLLS The Shops   The dolls are available from several sources, including the following:  Bangkok Dolls, 85 Soi Rajatapan, Makkasan, Bangkok 10400 (telephone: 245-3008). The shop and museum are open daily, 10 A.M. to 6 P.M.; the factory, 8 A.M. to 5 P.M., closed Sundays and holidays. Mail orders are handled here; write for a brochure, then request a price that includes insurance and shipping; delivery takes about two weeks by air. If the dolls must be made to order, add another week. A second shop is near the Regent Hotel: Bangkok Dolls Arts & Crafts, Room 212, second floor, Peninsula Plaza, 153 Rajdamri Road, Bangkok 10500 (252-1492), open daily 10 A.M. to 6 P.M.

TAT (Tourism Authority of Thailand) Duty Free Company Ltd., 888 Pleonchit Road, Lumpini, Patumwan, Bangkok 10500 (253-6451-9), open daily 10 A.M. to 8 P.M.   Chitralada has five shops in Bangkok: at the Oriental Plaza, at Hilton International Hotel's shopping arcade, the Decorations Pavilion at the Grand Palace, at Wimanmek Mansion (directly behind the Bangkok National Assembly and said to be the world's largest building made entirely of golden teak) and at Don Muang International Airport. Branches are in Chiangmai International Airport, the Rose Garden in Nakhon Province and in South Pattaya. The Bangkok airport shop is open 24 hours every day and the branches from 9:30 A.M. to 4:30 P.M. except at the Grand Palace, which closes at 3:30. Information   It's a good idea to call before you go because the shops do close some days. If you're checking addresses on a map, remember that there's no standard transliteration for the Thai language; let sound rather than spelling, which varies quite a bit, be your guide.

''The Global Assembly Line,'' directed by Lorraine Gray, emphasizes the negative side of the arrangement. Workers in this country find themselves stranded as entire plants are shifted overseas. Foreign workers, mostly young women initially grateful for the employment, soon grow discontented with their working conditions, pay scales and restrictions on organizing. At least the ones focused on here do. It's an informative hour, and Miss Gray's sympathies for workers in both countries gives her work heart.

Tartan plaid was plastered throughout last week's fall shows in New York: in dresses (Ralph Lauren), belts (Nicole Miller), hats (Trinder & Boylan), scarfs (Isaac Mizrahi) and countless pleated skirts. A wee bit much, but then plaid is like Sean Connery: everyone seems to like it.   Chocolate was an important color, often mixed with pink. Skirts were still short but away from the legs. Perhaps designers reasoned that the recent skintight looks were rather unforgiving, and besides, women have tons of tube skirts in their closets already. The season's beau ideal was the model Nadege in a short petally skirt, looking like a flower with pencils sticking out of the bottom.   In several shows there was a new kind of double dressing: long dress jackets, which can stand on their own, worn over a dress","excerpt":"the double skirts at Michael Kors, where a close-fitting underskirt was topped by a looser overskirt; or Jennifer George's coats, with a buttoned jacket front sewn into the lining to give the illusion of a suit. Reversibility was also a recurring theme (Randolph Duke, Donna Karan). The strategy seems to be to give women added value.   A more baffling double style was the one-piece legging-boot at Anne Klein. A pair of leggings was attached to a pair of shoes. Question: How do you choose the right size, for the leggings or the shoe? And where to clean it, the shoe store?  No Fur, No Job    More and more fashion models are refusing to walk down the runways in fur.   Karen Alexander, a model who had been booked for a fashion show on Thursday, was canceled at the last minute when she refused to model a fur-trimmed dress. At an earlier fitting, Ms. Valentine had assumed the dress was trimmed in fake fur, she said.    When another model told her, just hours before the show, that it was real fur, Ms. Valentine asked to be put in a different dress. She was dropped from the lineup instead.   At some agencies, models' preferences on wearing fur are listed on their photo composites along with their measurements, hair color and shoe size. Meeting the Buyers   Five American designers showed collections on the mezzanine of the Paramount Hotel on Sunday, trying to take advantage of an estimated 200 store buyers staying in the hotel.   \\"It's so easy for them to just pop in before going out to dinner,\\" said Robert Savage, who is married to one of the designers, Lanette Lepore of Robespierre, and helped organize the show.    All five collections -- Anni Kuan, Assembly Line , Bettina Budewig, Jenne Maag and Robespierre -- are very structured, well-made lines with a forward-fashion touch. For example, Robespierre features Donegal Irish tweeds and plaid jackets this season.   \\"Everybody does the same thing at once,\\" Ms. Lepore said. \\"No one wants to be left out in the cold.\\"    The designers paid $2,500 each, about half of most trade shows, for the three-day event, which ends at 7 P.M. today.   Over at the Macklowe Hotel, a group of 20 British designers were camped out in suites on the 31st floor. With many American buyers having canceled their London fashion trips in March out of concern over the Persian Gulf War, the British decided to bring their wares to New York.    Business was excellent, several executives said.   \\"In a sense, good things have come out of bad,\\" said Murray Arbeid, the British designer. \\"The war, of course, is why we're here. But the results have been astonishing. We've been selling steadily and consistently for four days.\\"    Mr. Arbeid, who specializes in dressy evening clothes, said he sensed a new mood.   \\"For the first time in 35 years I've done no embroidery,\\" he said. \\"It's a less showy time.\\" Patterns"},{"year":"1991","title":"The double standard in the Middle East has become built into American diplomacy and journalism.

If a picture speaks a thousand words, then what does one’s picture on the front of a garish, oversize sweatshirt say? I found myself asking this question — along with many others — when I unwrapped the one and only present my family bought me for my 15th birthday (pictured above). Though bespoke fashion may be all the rage these days, this sweatshirt bespoke, if not be-screamed, a little too much to a 15-year-old. There were the more subtle particulars of taste — it’s white, a color I didn’t wear, and about five sizes too big. Then, there was the white elephant in the room: namely, the larger-than-life photograph pasted on the front, arguably the worst picture ever taken of me, ever.  I remember that the initial moment of shock led to specific interrogatives — why does it say “Buenos Dias” along the top? Why is Buenos Dias in quotes? Do they want me to learn Spanish? Then there were the broader questions of usage — what could I possibly do with this sweatshirt? Frame it? Wear it? Exchange it for a navy sweatshirt, five sizes smaller, with a better picture, that said, “Guten Tag”? What would ever make my family think that I’d want a sweatshirt with my picture on it? I wish I could say that this was an aberration in the history of Marks family gift giving. Alas, I cannot. My father is an Oxford-trained psychiatrist, with a very impressive series of letters festooning his business card, whereas my mother is thoroughly schooled in all things luxury. Over the years we have refined the art of bad gift giving into a form of psychological warfare (with distinct stages, categories and symptoms). There are no kettles or coat racks in our household, only gifts that ask more questions than they answer, such as the elaborately wrapped Prada boxes I once received containing a wonderful mélange of bath salts and perfumes (for women). It’s little wonder that as December rolls around, I find myself waking up in cold sweats, biting my nails and pacing my apartment, all in dreaded ponderance of one thing: what will my family be giving me, and what will I be giving them, for the holidays? Years past have brought us many different categories of bad gifts. There’s the Reflexive Regifted (a watch given to me for my 13th birthday, then accidentally regiven to me five years later as a high school graduation present), the Gifts Replacing Gifts We’ve Accidentally Broken (a Lalique figurine I shattered in the front hall, a replica of which I found on eBay and bought for my mom) and the British Foodstuffs We’d Never Eat (all the silly-named pies and puddings my father dutifully imports from Fortnum and Mason’s, which the rest of the family considers unfit for human consumption). One year, my father made the foolish mistake of actually expressing excitement over several Hermès ties we bought him. And so, my mother, sister and I latched onto his glee like a bull shark onto a seal, and he became the focus of our newly minted Gifts We Keep on Giving Category — long orange boxes appearing at the edge of his bed on every major cause for celebration. Not including the ones he’s taken out of circulation or the ones I’ve stolen, at last count he had 84 Hermès ties, enough, perhaps, to start his own duty-free shop at Charles de Gaulle. Once we recognized that our family could, in fact, muster our efforts and give one good present, we entered the Gifts in Bulk period. (Note: this differs from the former category in that the Gifts We Keep on Giving gives the same gift to one person, whereas Gifts in Bulk gives the same gift to many, many people). For several years, we’d gather at the Thanksgiving table and decide on one thing to give everybody else. Then, we’d buy enough of that one thing to warrant — at least, up until recently — owning shares in the company. From late November till early January our front hallway looked like a staging area for the Berlin air drop, save that everything was gift-wrapped. One holiday season, we sent out enough Slatkin and Co. candles — Twigs for men, Bamboo and Jasmine for women — to illuminate a small football field. A subperiod of the Gifts in Bulk stage had its own scientific name: Phalaenopsis amabilis, the simple white orchid, potted with moss and tagged with a gift card written by the florist. Our orchid-giving days were perhaps our best, that is until a form of “orchid inflation” set in. Instead of one plant, we’d send two, then three, then four. The Orchid-giving subperiod crested shortly after I finished my first novel, when my mother had a seven phalaenopsis arrangement delivered to my apartment. The glass container holding these plants was so large and heavy it took two people to lift and could barely fit through my front door. When the plants died and I got another friend to help me move the arrangement from the wood dining room table, the container had worn a hole right through the center. For several years we retreated to neutral corners, exchanging credit card numbers with each other and simply buying our own gifts. “Thank you so much for the La Mer,” my sister would say to me, “which will be appearing on your Amex as a charge made to Neiman Marcus on Dec. 2!” Or, on a note on the kitchen counter, “Wanted to thank everyone for the new telephoto lens everybody bought me from B&H Camera! Love, Dad.” There are those rare occasions when we’ve been able to give truly meaningful gifts to each other — the set of first edition Kurt Vonneguts my parents bought me when I got into college","excerpt":"the dozen or so political cartoons of Winston Churchill, cut from old Punch magazines, that I gave my father for Father’s Day; the rare Brassocattleya orchid we found to replace one that my mother had lost during a hurricane. So when my best friend turned 21, I wanted to transcend all this bad gift-giving blood and give him something that showed how much I cared. So at his birthday dinner, held at some forsaken Baltimore restaurant, he unwrapped a gift that he’d never forget — namely a gift that said “Buenos Dias!” Even though this might have fallen in the Reflexive Regifting category, I don’t think that the sentiment of an old, oversize white sweatshirt was lost on him, especially with a picture like that on the front.

Built in 1889, the Gladstone sunk to fleabag status for a few decades until a local developer purchased it in 2002 and began a full renovation. After a partial opening last summer, and an official one in December, it has already established itself as an anchor of the city's art scene. With popular hangouts at street level and a second floor dedicated to exhibition space and artist studios, it attracts more locals than visitors. Original architectural details were preserved during the renovation, yet the whole place oozes the urban feel of contemporary Toronto.    THE LOCATION -- Queen Street West in Parkdale, once the unremarkable western fringe of a busy downtown street, has become the stomping ground of Toronto's creative community (the city has declared it part of an Art and Design District). Boutiques, galleries and cafes have taken over the storefronts, and stylishly scruffy individuals shuffle between these establishments day and night. Residents are just now lamenting the arrival of the first Starbucks. The Gladstone is the second hotel renovation to reflect the changes in the area","excerpt":"the Drake Hotel (built in 1890), which is known more for its bar, restaurant and cafe than its guest rooms, opened here two years ago.    THE ROOMS -- Local artists have designed each of the 37 guest rooms, which span a wide range of aesthetic styles and features. Common to all rooms are welcome touches like flat-screen TV's, DVD players and billowy white bedding, yet none of them have minibars or coffeemakers. Beyond these standards, it's a roll of the dice. My Canadiana Room had an antler chandelier, pixilated forest wallpaper and a selection of second-hand Canadian novels in the credenza. Missing were a couple of basics: an alarm clock and a chair for the desk. Other rooms pay homage to an eclectic range of subjects, including biker culture, Teen Beat magazine and jigsaw puzzles. The hallways and other public areas are lined with local art, all of which is for sale and changed frequently.    THE BATHROOMS -- The so-called Gimme More rooms (like the one I stayed in) at the upper end of the price range have big and bright bathrooms equipped with combination tub and shower. The standard rooms have smaller bathrooms with shower stalls. New fixtures include pedestal sinks and small shelves that leave minimal room for toiletries. In a surprisingly earthy move, soap, shampoo and moisturizer all come in bar form from a small Canadian soap maker.    AMENITIES -- There's no gym and there are few fancy services, but the hotel's three bars take care of entertainment. The Melody Bar is host to popular karaoke nights Thursday through Saturday. The larger Ballroom is home to a variety of events -- concerts, performance-art shows and private parties -- while the smallest, the Art Bar, is used for other creative events, including life-drawing classes on Wednesdays. The hotel's original hand-operated elevator, which now travels in a glass shaft through the center of the main staircase, is a highlight -- as long as you can find someone to run it, which isn't always the case.    ROOM SERVICE -- There is none, but the Ballroom serves breakfast and lunch, and pub fare is available in the Melody at night. The friendly staff members are also happy to recommend nearby restaurants. One of the best bets is the dining room and raw bar at the Drake, just a few blocks east (1150 Queen Street West).    THE BOTTOM LINE -- With one foot in the past and the other in up-to-the-minute hipster territory, the Gladstone offers immediate immersion in Toronto's art scene for a relatively inexpensive 165 to 185 Canadian dollars a night ($150 to $168, at 1.14 Canadian dollars to the U.S. dollar).

There is little to challenge or stimulate the serious theatergoer.   Once, playwrights were pivotal figures in the American theater.

Still, it's a good story, false or true, and it has been made into a whopping adventure film with more action, suspense and melodrama than even a juramentado could shake his bolo at.Henry Hathaway (of \\"The Lives of a Bengal Lancer,\\" Hathaways) is chiefly responsible for it, we suspect, for Mr. Hathaway always has been one for direct action, honest blood-letting and fine big splashes of villainy. He directs with all the bugles blowing","excerpt":"the drums rolling and a tall man like Gary Cooper on a parapet heaving sticks of dynamite down on the attackers. And when there isn't a big fight scene on the day's schedule, he likes to taper off with such small encounters as that, say, between a burly Moro with a four-foot machete and a slight little Mindanaon with an empty rifle. There's hardly ever a neutral corner on his screen.The peculiar plot he is spading happens, of course, to he perfect for his free-swinging style. In 1906, so runs it, the American army of occupation abandoned Mindinao, leaving five officers behind to recruit and train a native constabulary against the fierce bolo-men of Alipang. The recruits had no taste for battle, especially after two of the officers had been cut down by the juramentados—these being the messenger boys of destruction sent out from time to time by Alipang. But Mr. Cooper, as the army surgeon, found a way to stiffen their spines, and a cholera outbreak, created by the Moros' damming of the river, did the rest.Mr. Hathaway couldn't have found a more appropriate cast. Mr. Cooper as the grimly grinning war machine, Andrea Leeds as the captain's daughter, Reginald Owen as the commanding officer barking to conceal his growing blindness, David Niven as the waggish lieutenant, Broderick Crawford as the burly chap with a love of orchids, Tetsu Komai as Alipang, Vladimir Sokoloff as the treacherous Datu—how else could it have been cast? So, if it's an adventure film you want, uncomplicated by small talk and unconditionally guaranteed to build up your blood pressure, the Rivoli's the place to find it. THE SCREEN: FOUR FILMS IN REVIEW; A Whopping Picture Is 'The Real Glory' With Gary Cooper, at the Rivoli--'Blackmail,' Featuring Edward G. Rabinson, Is Presented at the Capital--Two Foreign Pictures Also Are Shown"},{"year":"2005","title":"As a songwriter and bassist for the New York bands Ivy and Fountains of Wayne, Adam Schlesinger has probed the expressive possibilities of the pop song, crafting miniature dramas with wit and catchy hooks. A prolific songwriter for film and television, he is currently writing songs for a musical adaptation of the John Waters movie, ''Cry-Baby.'' Last week Virgin released Fountains of Wayne's ''Out-of-State Plates,'' a two-CD collection of new and unreleased material. Speaking recently with Joel Topcik, Mr. Schlesinger discussed what he has been listening to and why:    Def Leppard     I was just given a copy of Def Leppard's new all-covers album, ''Yeah!,'' which is coming out this fall on Island/Def Jam. If I were asked to come up with a list of fantasy songs for Def Leppard to cover, it would look pretty much like the one it came up with itself -- the Kinks' ''Waterloo Sunset,'' ''No Matter What'' by Badfinger and songs by T. Rex and E.L.O. With this album, Def Leppard is finally dropping any pretense of being a metal band, which of course it never really was, and admitting that it has always been a power-pop band. The production doesn't have that larger-than-life sheen of its Mutt Lange-produced 80's hits","excerpt":"the drums sound like drums, not cannon shots. It just sounds like a really tight garage band that also sings great harmonies.    Spoon     The indie-rock group Spoon is my favorite band these days. I was turned on to it by Darren Jessee, the drummer for the Ben Folds Five, who gave me a copy of Spoon's ''Girls Can Tell,'' from 2001. But it was ''Kill the Moonlight'' the next year that got me really hooked on its thing. The new record, ''Gimme Fiction'' (Merge), feels slightly looser and quirkier than the previous one. Britt Daniel sings in a distinctive, clipped style that has traces of John Lennon and David Bowie, and he has a way with little throwaway ''uh-huh's'' and ''awright's'' that are as meaningful as any of his lyrics. But what I love most about the band's sound is the negative space in its arrangements. Often there's so little going on that the introduction of a tambourine part can seem absolutely momentous. As someone who has a tendency to layer on too much stuff in the studio when a song doesn't feel like it's quite done -- a keyboard track or backing vocals -- I'm very inspired by Spoon's restraint.    X     The new DVD ''X: Live in Los Angeles'' was recorded at a pair of reunion shows in 2004, but this is no Las Vegas version of X; the band looks and sounds just as vital as it did in 1980. When I was a kid, I thought this was the most abrasive, bizarre music I had ever heard, but now I hear how much of a pop sensibility there was to what X did. Like a lot of the best punk bands -- the Clash and the Pixies, bands that seem anti-everything on the surface -- X is really a band of pop traditionalists. Exene and John Doe have a duet style that can barely be called harmonizing, but the sound of their voices together is a lot of what makes the band's songs work. This DVD has great renditions of ''We're Desperate'' and ''Johnny Hit and Run Pauline,'' as well as a couple of bonus acoustic duets and a photo gallery by the group's guitarist, Billy Zoom.    Stereolab     It's often hard to identify a Stereolab song by name; the song titles don't necessarily appear in the lyrics, and they're so random besides. But this electronic pop band from Britain has been consistently original and great for nearly 15 years. The new box set, ''Oscillons From the Anti-Sun'' (Too Pure/Beggars), has a lot of unreleased material, some endearing and funny lo-fi videos, and, if that isn't enough, a bunch of Stereolab stickers too. But the best thing in the package is a live performance of its 1993 song ''French Disko'' from the British television show ''The Word.'' There is something bizarrely perfect about seeing Stereolab play in front of an audience of dancing teenagers as if it were just another dance band.    Tony Martino     A guy handed me a demo when I was in Chicago recently. I get handed stuff almost every day. I try to listen to all of it -- 99 percent is garbage. But every so often you get something that stands out. Tony Martino is maybe 20, 21 years old; he just introduced himself, said he was a fan and gave me a CD of really ethereal, textured pop with classic melodic structure. He has obviously listened to a lot of 1960's British music, and you can hear the Beach Boys in the stacked up vocal harmonies. He told me he was working with Ed Buller, who produced the early Suede records, and these 10 or 12 songs look to be the makings of an album. This is a guy with incredible potential.    Jim Florentine     Jim Florentine is a comedian whose juvenile humor is perfect for long bus rides between gigs. That's how I first heard his ''Terrorizing Telemarketers'' recordings when our guitar tech put them on. They are sort of reverse prank phone calls in which Jim makes telemarketers miserable in creative and sadistic ways. There are four CD's worth of calls, and you can hear Jim's voice on Comedy Central's prank-call show, ''Crank Yankers.'' Fountains of Wayne did the theme song for ''Crank Yankers,'' but I didn't make the connection with the guy we were listening to on the bus. In the best of the bunch, he pretends to have missed one important piece of information in a telemarketer's pitch, and makes her read her entire script backward as he mercilessly interrupts her, saying: ''No, no, not that. I think it was what you said right before that.''

On Thursday night at the Gaillard Municipal Auditorium here, the opera had, for better and worse, the characteristics of a butterfly preserved in amber -- or rather, in layers of amber. It was charming in parts, a bit clouded, but portrayed well enough to reveal some neglected virtues. It was also almost as interesting for the layers of preservation as for the object itself.   The most remarkable aspect of this production is the sets, which were all used in the work's Rome premiere in 1882.

It is virtually the same bag of tricks as was used in Moran and Mack's \\"Why Bring That Up?\\" and while the ending in this current offering virtually is identical with that of its predecessor, it is accomplished here in an imaginative fashion.For the first time on the screen there is an impressive conception of a stage girl's delirious dream. This is wrought in Technicolor with modernistic settings, with action that is right down clever. Just before this dream comes to the screen one sees Casey. Hogan (Rosetta) and Babe Hogan (Vivian) in each other's arms. Babe is delirious and does not recognize her sister, and the ensuing scenes are the sick girl's dream of her stage hopes. This brightly arranged stretch also gives the director a chance to save the spectator several minutes anguish and at the same time permits him to entertain the audience with performances of the merry sisters as Babe dreams of their act.Even the lachrymose incidents are so adroitly acted that they have more than a veneer of truth. The bickering and recrimination that go on between Jimmy Dean (Lawrence Gray) and Casey are not without humor, and just as Casey's humor is the meat of the act, so the frolicking in this picture, more than anything else, causes it to be a corking good entertainment despite its stereotyped narrative.Besides the dream sequence there is another passage in natural colors, one concerned with a stage performance. It is rather confusing, however, to look at the same background first in rainbow hues and then in plain black and white, for only half of this chapter is in pastel shades.The vocalized screen serves the Duncan sisters well, for they are without a doubt infinitely more successful in this present affair than they were in their silent shadow production, \\"Topsy and Eva.\\" Sam Wood, the director of \\"It's a Great Life,\\" runs his story at a fast pace and makes the most of the talents of the Duncan sisters. There is also good singing and tuneful music in this film, \\"Following You\\" being one of the catchy melodies that is rendered several times.The opening scenes are far from conventional. The Hogan sisters, with a word or two about a purse, are perceived darting down the front steps of a house and then tearing through the streets. Their haste arouses the curiosity of a policeman and the sight of a minion of the law running stirs up the interest of hundreds of idle pedestrians. The shame-faced bluecoat eventually learns that he was pursuing two shopgirls who were five or ten minutes late for work.The glimpses inside Mandelbaum's department store provoke plenty of mirth, for such a place of business is a fertile field for the vivacious Duncans, and when they are subsequently beheld back-stage and before the footlights, these sisters naturally are in their element, and the fact that they are so familiar with the life of a stage performer is perhaps one reason why this production is so much more pleasing than the usual run of such yarns.Mr. Gray does well in the part of the ignoramus, Jimmy Dean, a piano player, who finds Casey Hogan one too many for him. He also sings pleasingly. Jed Prouty gives a sympathetic portrayal as a love-smitten store manager and Benny Friedman appears to advantage in the minor part of booking agent.On the surrounding program is a stage contribution called \\"Land of Syncopation,\\" devised and staged by Arthur Knorr. One of the best numbers in it is the work of the Caligary brothers, European acrobatic comedians. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"The Duncan Sisters.

Yeltsin if Russia could not meet its short-term debts, President Clinton said, because a meltdown of the ruble could threaten the stability the Government there. Mr. Clinton's statement appeared to pave the way for a new financial bailout of Russia by the International Monetary Fund.   A1    The Prime Minister of Russia said in an interview that the country did not need emergency international loans to pull itself out of its financial crisis. But the interview with the Prime Minister was taped before the statement by Mr. Clinton, whose his support had been sought by the Russian Government.   A8    Report Details Fate of Nazi Gold  Much of the gold looted by the Nazis was routed through Switzerland to pay other neutral nations for vital supplies that sustained Hitler's army in the last years of World War II, United States Government historians have concluded in a report.

A1    Pakistan's nuclear scientists were hailed as national heroes as they returned from the remote desert where they had set off atomic explosions. Ninety-seven percent of Pakistanis support the testing, according to a poll by the Pakistan Institute for Public Opinion conducted for Gallup International in major cities.   A6    Pakistan's nuclear tests required a global network of theft and espionage and the investment of millions of dollars. But the tests could not have happened without smuggled Chinese technology and contradictory shifts in American policy, say current and former United States officials.   A6    Afghan Quake Kills Over 3,000  At least 3,000 people died after an earthquake shook northeastern Afghanistan, and many more bodies were feared hidden under rubble, aid agencies said.

A12    Clinton's Missile Decision  The February decision by President Clinton to approve the Loral satellite launching by China was treated as an urgent matter not because of its importance to the national security but because the company was facing heavy fines for delay, according to White House documents. Concerns about European competition for the satellite business, and fears that denying the deal would damage the United States-China relationship, overrode words of caution from other Government agencies.

(Dryad Press/Jefferson Street Press/Taylor Publishing, $15.95.) In the early 1950's, college basketball was shaken by a point-shaving scandal. One of the most talented players of the era was Columbia University's Jack Molinas, a brilliant man compelled to live life on the edge. Drafted by the Fort Wayne Pistons of the National Basketball Association, he played in only 29 games before being banished from the league for placing bets on his own team. Several years later, after becoming a lawyer, he was convicted for his role in another college point-fixing scheme. After his release from prison, Molinas drifted into some shady deals and was eventually shot to death as he and a girlfriend sunbathed in his backyard in the Hollywood Hills. It is upon the life of Jack Molinas that the sportswriter Phil Berger has based his latest novel. Jake Cardoza is a kid from the Bronx who uses his brains as well as his enormous athletic ability to hoist himself out of the slums. Unfortunately, he's got the obligatory tragic flaw: a need to circumvent the rules. While others get caught in a college point-shaving conspiracy of which he is a part, Cardoza lucks out and winds up in the N.B.A., playing for a fictional team called the Rockbridge Stars. Naturally, character equaling destiny, Cardoza soon succumbs to his baser instincts, and therein lies this tale. Mr. Berger, who reports on boxing for The New York Times, knows his subject well and goes to great lengths to give the reader a sense of his story's time and place. Sometimes, however, he tries too hard","excerpt":"the early parts of the novel, for example, are overloaded with brand names and landmarks, an excess of detail that becomes wearisome, even irritating. In addition, Mr. Berger has set a difficult task for himself by trying to weave a fictional story that's more interesting than the real one on which it is based. Although he makes a valiant effort, in the end he isn't quite up to it. Instead, \\"Big Time\\" serves to whet the appetite for a book on the genuine article, rather than a pale imitation.

The pieces of this musical shown in &quot;Morning Sun&quot; are so fulsomely straightforward that being denied a chance to see it in its entirety feels like a form of deprivation. That is, until the directors focus on the adults who were indoctrinated under the firm, unambiguous hand of Mao. Then deprivation is defined in truly horrific terms. One of the grown-ups describes the Revolution in grimly elegant fashion: &quot;It was an age ruled by both the poet and the executioner; poets scattered roses everywhere, while the executioner cast a long shadow of terror.&quot;  It was a force that, as &quot;Sun&quot; reminds us, molded a new generation into killers without any sense of the long and tortured history of a China that existed before Mao brutally eliminated all traces of it. One of the few subtle points of &quot;Sun&quot; is that even simple, lurid tragedy looks different to its admirers as people mature. The eloquence of the interview subjects  and the clips have a power that the written narration, which often sounds like an &quot;All Things Considered&quot; segment, often lacks. &quot;Chairman Mao said, 'You young people are like the Morning Sun; our hope is placed on you,' &quot; remembers Li Nanyang, who was a child of 1960's China. And, as &quot;Sun&quot; unfolds, she's shown to be one of the Cultural Revolution's victims. Her father, Li Rui, who rose through the ranks to become Mao's secretary, made the mistake of criticizing a failing policy during the Great Leap Forward, when farms were converted into small factories and the resultant shortages nearly crippled the nation. His reward was being publicly repudiated and sent away. His then 9-year-old daughter was ridiculed until she denounced him. &quot;Sun&quot; ends with a reunion of father and daughter, brought together again after 11 years. — Elvis Mitchell The Loss of Relationships Under Mao's Rough Revolutionary Hand"},{"year":"1964","title":"UNIONDALE, L.

But they got little help in defining the values they were expected to teach.   Threats to the nation's economic competitiveness also raised demands for a response from the schools, particularly for better science teaching. Ironically, at the same time fundamentalists sought to elevate creationism to a science and to give it equal time with the teaching of evolution. Arguments over ''creation science'' went to the Supreme Court in a suit brought by Louisiana's Attorney General against the state's education authorities.

The decision not to charge him eliminates a major distraction for the White House and allows Mr. Rove to focus on the midterm elections. But a cloud hangs over the executive branch: I.

The court said Mr. Hill could challenge Florida's method of lethal injection under the Civil Rights Act of 1871, an appeals route with few obstacles. Death penalty opponents have questioned whether the drugs used eliminate pain. If not, they say, it is a cruel and unusual punishment. In their ruling, the justices gave no indication of where they stand on the issue.    FREED    The News -- Abu Bakar Bashir, an Islamic cleric linked to the bombings of two nightclubs in Bali three years ago, was released from an Indonesian prison.    Behind the News -- American officials said they were disappointed in the release of Mr. Bashir, whom they consider to be an important operative for Al Qaeda. Mr. Bashir had served a little over a year of a 30-month sentence after being convicted of conspiracy in connection with the bombings, which killed 202 people. The judges in the case said Mr. Bashir knew the perpetrators and may have encouraged them. But as he returned to his hometown there were signs his influence may be waning: the crowd that welcomed him was far smaller than expected.    SUED    The News -- KFC was sued by a nutrition advocacy group seeking to have it stop using partially hydrogenated oils in its fried chicken and other foods.    Behind the News -- The lawsuit by the Center for Science in the Public Interest came after the group had unsuccessfully petitioned the Food and Drug Administration to require warning signs in restaurants regarding use of the oils, a major source of trans fats, which nutritionists consider unhealthy. KFC said the suit was frivolous and that the company took health issues seriously. It said it was reviewing the use of alternative oils, but that maintaining the flavor of the original Colonel Sanders fried chicken recipe was important.

Within the defective score that has come down to us, dances have their places in a chain of events that also includes songs, dialogues and choruses, but probably in a 17th-century performance the infiltration of dancing went further. Graceful movement and posing would have been expected of the soloists as much as beautiful singing, and members of the chorus, in their bodies and the spacing of their bodies, would have given a visual equivalent to their music. All this would make sense, whether the work was written for a girls' school in London or, as modern scholarship implies, for the court of Charles II.    There was therefore some reason for Catherine Turocy, credited in the program as stage director and choreographer, to give us statuesque groupings, elegantly curving arm gestures and trim dancing, though whether these should have been so much based on 17th-century records is another matter. We now expect some degree of archeological exactitude in the performance of music","excerpt":"the effort to learn from documents has produced not wooden reproduction but a great cascade of new approaches to the music of Bach, Handel and Purcell.

Now, apparently, NBC's fortunes having improved, it is the turn of the struggling ABC to try being different, at least once in a while.   Sunday evening at 9 o'clock, the network presented ''The Execution of Raymond Graham,'' one of the more intriguing drama projects of the season. The network kept stressing that this was its first live broadcast of a dramatic program in over 25 years. Of course, viewers on the West Coast would be seeing a tape-delayed broadcast, which muddied any arguments about the virtues of live presentations. And further, about 20 minutes of the two-hour presentation were indeed pre-recorded, which meant that, discounting the commercial breaks, fewer than 80 minutes were actually ''live.''

His statement that the Pythagorean theorem was known 1,000 years before Pythagoras shows how black male self-esteem will be fostered in the planned school. It will be done by insisting that whites, particularly the Greeks, stole the basic ideas and institutions of Western civilization from the (black) Egyptians.   This is the thesis of a book by George G. M. James, \\"The Stolen Legacy\\" (1954), which should be read by those concerned by black attacks on the Western heritage. The thesis is widely accepted by black educators. It is also demonstrably wrong. Mr. James, for example, (echoed by Mr. Mchawi) maintains that Alexander the Great pillaged the Library of Alexandria on behalf of his old tutor, Aristotle. There was no Alexandria to pillage until Alexander founded the city and the consensus of classical scholars is that the great library was not created until some 50 years after the deaths of Alexander and Aristotle.   The case of the Pythagorean theorem is equally clear. The Babylonians knew the Pythagorean relationship, a  + b  = c","excerpt":"the Egyptians knew that a 3,4,5 triangle for which the Pythagorean theorem holds was a right triangle, but theorems, the proof of the relationship, are Hellenic.   Black intellectuals condemn Western civilization, yet ardently wish to prove it was founded by their ancestors.

(The Sixth Avenue El underwent an unfortunate reincarnation, its steel having been sold as scrap to Japan in the late 30's.) A canopy formed by the Third Avenue El's spindly girders plunged the pubs and antiques stores below into perpetual twilight. Its tracks could not accommodate the newer (and faster) trains, but the El continued to rumble until  1955, when Ann Shanks preserved its final months with these and other vivid photographs that will be exhibited at the New York Transit Museum in Brooklyn from Jan. 21 through March 24. At the El's demise, its replacement by a new Second Avenue line seemed assured. It wasn't.

The Casino Revenue Fund was established in 1976 to pay for the reduction of property taxes, rents and utility bills of those over 65 years old.

The news coming from Washington regarding President Bush's proposed budget (front page, Feb. 5) threatens a generation of Americans who do not know what to expect next on health care. Medicare, a program established to provide for the health of the elderly, is again being singled out by the Bush Administration for disproportionate cuts.   Health care is not an economic commodity. Health care is a social good. Every citizen has a legitimate expectation of access to health care, and physicians and hospitals have legitimate expectations to be properly compensated for providing that care. Our nation must develop a system that responds to the health-care needs of the elderly and the millions of others who lack health care.   It will be interesting to see what Congress does with the latest proposals, especially since these proposals actually rehash proposals previously rejected. Let's hope Congress does its job in holding the President accountable.  JOHN E. CURLEY JR.

Medicaid spending inthe state was cut by 9 percent last year. No one suffered because of the reduction. No one really noticed.

Although Mr. Pataki wants a 12 percent  Medicaid cut next year - about $1.1 billion - there will again be no health emergency.

Still, Mr. Petruso has engaged in a fair amount of crystal-gazing of late, equipping his district's elementary schools with computers, laser disks, compact-disk players, 8-millimeter video camcorders, videocassette recorders and Sony Watchman televisions.   Only a small number of schools nationwide have gone so wholeheartedly into high-technology education. But more and more schools are eyeing the field and sallying forth. The problem for educators, as Mr. Petruso notes, is understanding the new and emerging technologies and the promise they hold, so as to tap the best ones for classrooms of the present and future.

War, weather, modernization, religious tension, neglect or tourism -- sometimes more than one -- have ravaged these treasures, imperiling their existence. Many pictures in ''Vanishing Histories: 100 Endangered Sites From the World Monuments Watch'' are sad. They depict monuments like the Thomaskirche in Leipzig, where Johann Sebastian Bach was choirmaster, Richard Wagner was baptized and Martin Luther preached, now suffering from pollution, damp and insect infestation. Or the My Son temple complex in Quang Nam province, Vietnam, built between A.D. 300 and 1200, ranking in size and importance with Angkor Wat, now overrun with weeds. The book spans the globe, encompassing famous landmarks like Petra in Jordan and obscure ones like the Tipasa archaeological site in Algeria. With many of these sites shown in lush color, ''Vanishing Histories'' is a beautiful book. Colin Amery, the former architectural correspondent of The Financial Times in London, and Brian Curran Jr., director of projects for the World Monuments Fund in Britain, briefly describe the history of each site, then provide details of its troubles and preservation efforts. What they write is plain and simple. But together with the pictures, their words deliver an eloquent message that is hard to ignore.
