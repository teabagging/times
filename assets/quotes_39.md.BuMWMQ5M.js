Our solace must become our resolve to speak as fearlessly as he spoke, imagine as creatively as he imagined, and work as tireless as he worked.   CYLAR--Keith. BTQ Financial and the Hudson Planning Group mourn the loss of advocate and friend Keith Cylar. His vision, courage, and commitment to improving the lives of homeless people living with HIV/AIDS were both inspiring and transformative","excerpt":"stated most simply, his work created positive change, in individual lives and throughout communities. We extend our deepest sympathies to the Housing Works community, his partner Charles King, and to the thousands of people personally touched by Keith's work. The world was made better by Keith's example; those who knew him will continue his work.   CYLAR--Keith. The Board of Directors of the AIDS Day Services Association of New York shares the profound sadness at the loss of our colleague and friend, Keith Cylar. Keith was a national leader in the field of AIDS services, caring for the most disenfranchised in our community. His unceasing advocacy, boundless compassion, and personal courage were truly an inspiration to all of us who worked with him so closely. We express our heartfelt sympathy to Keith's devoted partner, Charles King, his family and the Housing Works community for whom he was a beacon of hope and fearless protector.   CYLAR--Keith.
