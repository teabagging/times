Q: Why would anyone buy at full price when so many stores promote sales of their basic goods several times a year? A: That's a crazy practice that somebody started by saying, \\"I can get extra retail volume at a time that's dead.\\" As a result, they probably destroyed their business and thought they were huge heroes because they did such good business in the dead month of February. For people to spend money at regular prices, they have to be reassured that that price will be stable for at least a six-month period. But some retailers get panicky and lower their prices very soon, and the person who bought something at full price hasn't even had a chance to wear it yet because the weather hasn't permitted it. I think semiannual sales are a good way of supporting a market instead of panicking and just dumping everything and  losing your pricing structure.

A mild-mannered, apolitical upper-class Swede who was an importer of luxury foods from Hungary, he was directly responsible for saving thousands of Hungarian Jews from massacre by the Nazis.   In the film's opening scene, Wallenberg is traveling in the luxury dining car of a train speeding through central Europe when it suddenly halts, and policemen run through the cars drawing the shades. Peeking out his window, Wallenberg watches the bodies of Jewish prisoners being dumped from the cattle car of a freight train across the tracks.

The case simmered throughout the 1930's, and its underlying tensions are still very much with us. Edgar Nkosi White, a playwright, and Genji Ito, a composer, have built a stylized blues opera from the basic facts of the case.   The plot focuses on Clarence Norris, \\"last of the Scottsboro boys,\\" who lived to be pardoned by Gov. George C. Wallace of Alabama in 1976. He is represented as a naive, wayward soul who leaves his mother and girlfriend to find work. Thrown summarily into prison, he finds himself the victim of racial hatred. He is about to be lynched when Samuel Leibowitz, constantly referred to as \\"a lawyer from New York City,\\" arrives on the scene. Leibowitz's defense fails, and Norris breaks out of prison rather than face a death sentence. He finds his girlfriend, Donna Lee, shows up at Leibowitz's apartment in New York and is directed to a hiding place in Harlem. The police recapture him and return him to Alabama. In a vibrant gospel epilogue, he is shown being pardoned by the villainous sheriff, who is seated in Wallace's wheelchair.

But independent analysts say that Governor Pataki's proposed $66.1 billion budget for the fiscal year that begins April 1 squanders a rare chance to use the surplus to correct longterm problems, instead making them worse.

Besides accusations that he failed to pay taxes on his winnings from the show, he is accused of using donations made to his charity for personal expenses and failing to pay taxes on hundred of thousands of dollars in other income. Before the hearing, Mr. Hatch, 44, called the accusations absurd. He said: ''I've never taken a penny from a charity, and they know it. I've always paid my taxes, and they know it.'' He was released on $50,000 bond, ordered to surrender his passport and restricted to Rhode Island, where he lives, and Houston, where his lawyer's office is situated.

''The prefix Vilar will disappear from all printed material, and signage around the building will be altered over the forthcoming months,'' the announcement said. It said that Mr. Vilar, an opera-loving philanthropist, had pledged nearly $19 million to its development appeal, ''and in recognition of this generosity the Floral Hall was renamed the Vilar Floral Hall.'' But it said that despite warnings this year that his name would be removed if he failed to meet payment deadlines, ''we have received no communication from Mr. Vilar.'' He was arrested in May and indicted on charges of defrauding a client of his Amerindo Investment Advisors of more than $5 million and using some of the money to make donations.

Motley Crue's performance in Atlanta during its Carnival of Sin reunion tour ended after five songs on Friday when the singer Vince Neil slipped off the stage, partly ripped a calf muscle and was taken to a hospital, Reuters reported. ''He will be able to perform but can't really jump around until it heals,'' said Nikki Sixx, the band's bassist. ''Luckily we have a few days off here and there for him to recover.'' The Atlanta show is to be rescheduled.  Coldplay has apologized to fans in the United States after canceling concerts last week in Tampa, Fla., and Birmingham, Ala., because the singer Chris Martin was suffering from throat problems, the BBC reported. ''It was felt by his doctor that if he didn't give his voice a rest, he might not be able to sing for the rest of the U.S. dates, the drummer Will Champion said in a statement on the band's Web site. ''Please be assured that we are planning to return to the U.S. in the spring of 2006, and when we do, we will definitely reschedule both of these shows.''    Renoir Recovered       Stolen from the National Museum in Stockholm five years ago, the Renoir painting ''Young Parisian'' has been recovered in the United States, Agence France-Presse reported. ''It was recovered two or three months ago,'' Bjorn Engstrom, a Swedish police spokesman said, adding that its return to Sweden is expected this week. The painting was stolen along with another Renoir, ''Conversation,'' and a Rembrandt self-portrait. ''Conversation'' was recovered by chance in a drug raid in 2001, and the Rembrandt was recovered last week in a sting operation in Copenhagen.

Such primal emotion, seized and sustained, was the core of Ms. Ono's concert at the Knitting Factory on Wednesday night. She doesn't perform often, but as she stood in a spotlight surrounded by darkness, her body contorted and her voice moving from childlike peeps to tortured grunts and cries, she was spellbinding.         In recent years, the 63-year-old Ms. Ono has been recognized as a foremother  of alternative rock. She collaborated with her husband, John Lennon, but she also worked separately on songs of hugely varying quality -- some startling, some negligible. The seeming naivete, and sometimes simple banality, of her lyrics has been taken up by groups from Shonen Knife to Cibo Matto, the New York duo that joined Ms. Ono onstage for a few songs. And her unfettered voice presaged not just avant-garde vocalists like Diamanda Galas and Shelley Hirsch,  but the raw tones of rock singers like Sinead O'Connor and Bjork.

First came the disclosure of a 1947 memo from Benjamin J. M. Gorby, an officer in charge of operations for the 970th Counter-Intelligence Corps of the Army, that his office had received information that Dr. Mengele had been arrested in Vienna in 1947.

Unexpectedly, Anagrama, a small, prize-winning independent literary house, found it had a year-long super best seller with John Kennedy Toole's ''Confederacy of Dunces.'' Good writers are making their prose more accessible. Both Eduardo Mendoza and Manolo Vazquez Montalban have experimented with the detective novel, now a very modish genre.   Fernando Savater, Spain's most popular young philosopher, also wants his ideas to be understood by the general public; in addition to his essays, he writes plays, novels and detective stories. Bypassing linguistics with casual aplomb as though all that jazz had never happened, Mr. Savater has assumed real prominence by dusting off the old-fashioned study of ethics and presenting it to the Spaniards as being just what they need. Both physically and intellectually all over the place, Mr. Savater jets around Spain, talking to newly created lecture-circuit audiences. Instead of citing imperialism as the enemy, he points out to his countrymen (as did generation of thinkers prior to Spain's Civil War) that their primary enemy is Spanish fatalism. What most excites Mr. Savater is that his generation of writers has found a brand new and enthusiastic public at home; the lecture circuit is a new phenomenon for Spain.

''We wanted to aim lower.'' So instead of expending the time, energy and Internet bandwidth to build a Web site dedicated to all the Jews who made their names in the arts, Mr. Segal and the other founders of Jewsrock.org opted for a less ambitious project: a virtual shrine to the sons and daughters of Israel who have practiced rock 'n' roll. Another curator for Jewsrock.org -- coming soon, though a beta version has been running for several weeks -- is Jeffrey Goldberg, a staff writer at The New Yorker, and its manager is Allen Goldberg (no relation), director of branding and communications at XM Satellite Radio. The site pays semi-serious tribute to rockin' Jews both genuine and honorary, from Bob Dylan and Lou Reed to two-thirds of Sleater-Kinney.    Dubbed the Jewish Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, until some unpleasant mishegoss involving the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum in Cleveland necessitated a name change (''Is there anything more un-rock 'n' roll than a temporary restraining order?'' Mr. Segal asked), Jewsrock.org plans to offer such diverse content as essays on the Sex Pistols manager Malcolm McLaren and the clothier Nudie Cohen","excerpt":"a recipe for chopped liver from the Dictators' frontman, Handsome Dick Manitoba; and even a place where Jewish rock fans can -- gasp! -- show their decidedly unkosher tattoos. ''It's a shanda'' -- a shame -- Mr. Segal admitted. ''It's a part of rock 'n' roll culture, and it's totally against tradition, but there are Jewish people out there who just can't resist.''    Perhaps the most compelling feature is the online quiz ''Jew or Not?'' Visitors are shown photographs of well-known rockers and asked to guess whether they're members of the tribe. The quiz says Paula Abdul and Billy Joel are indeed Jewish, as are all four members of the pop-rock band the Knack, and even the woman who inspired their hit 1979 single ''My Sharona.'' (She now sells real estate in Los Angeles.) By the somewhat malleable Jewsrock.org criteria, so too are Beck (a well-known Scientologist), the Strokes guitarist Nick Valensi (who has only a Jewish father) and the punk group New Found Glory (three of their five members actually are), but really, who's kvetching?

It is another yarn of a speeding and dancing daughter, who is taught, chiefly through crooks and bullets, that although her father is rolling in wealth he does not own the city in which he lives, let alone the earth.This incredible piece of work begins as a comedy and then turns into melodrama. During the early stages it aroused some laughter, especially from the younger element yesterday afternoon, for they admired the headstrong conduct of Babs Holworthy and the ready patter of the subtitles. There were later, however, periods of absolute quiet, which may or may not have meant that most of those in the big theatre were thrilled by the queer conduct of a millionaire, the audacity of a bootlegger and the sangfroid of gangsters who elect to riddle a rival with bullets in a crowded dance hall.The only persons to be respected in this film are Motorcycle Policeman Dan Brown and Judge Elliott. Babs Holworthy is a silly little darkeyed girl and Buck Brown, for all the compliments paid to him in the subtitles, does not behave like a particularly brainy person. Babs's father is virtually responsible for the murder of Tony, the bootlegger, who, it must be admitted, is enough to exasperate any ordinary man. Even so, as the heroine's father, one would expect this eminently respectable Mr. Holworthy to be above appealing to hijackers for protection and promising favors to Dan Brown's son.Babs is in the habit of closing her eyes to stop signals and she happens to run afoul of Judge Elliott and Dan Brown. The wild young creature is not in the least perturbed by a summons. She tears it to pieces before the policeman's back is turned and, to her, it is then a matter of the past.Dan Brown's son, Buck, happens to be one of the guests at a party in Babs's palatial home, when Dan Brown comes to serve a bench warrant on Miss Holworthy. Dan insists on carrying out his mission which, of course, does not make Buck particularly popular. Our speeding maiden then comes up for sentence and Judge Elliott, despite the fact that he is alluded to, unwittingly, as a \\"sap,\\" is lenient with her. She must pay a hundred dollars or go to prison for ten days!A bootlegger named Tony enters into the yarn prior to this. He is impersonated by Roy D'Arcy, the man with a perpetual smile. Somehow, the show of white teeth displayed by Mr. D'Arcy in all his film portrayal, does not suit a bootlegger. Tony is perceived talking to Babs, which is infuriating to Mr. Holworthy, who ejects Tony and tells his butler to \\"throw out the 'stuff,'\\" which, incidentally, is packed neatly in automobile upholstery. There's a wicked leer on Tony's face, as he promises Mr. Holworthy to get even.In one of the subtitles Malcolm Stuart Boylan describes Tony as a young man who expected to float into society on a case of Scotch. Mr. Boylan has some other good captions, but also some that were very forced.Sue Carol is attractive, vivavious and capable as the reckless Miss Holsworthy. William Russell officiates as the honest policeman. Nick Stuart is the disappointed hero, Buck Brown.There are some interesting subjects on the Movietone newsreel, and S. L. Rothafel's stage numbers are appealing to the eye and the ear. Those nimble dancers, the Roxyettes, are perceived this time, during a charming offering called \\"Voices of Spring,\\" as nothing more nor less than a rainbow. When one first gazes upon the prismatic arc one would never for a moment suppose that it was made up of thirty-two dancing girls. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"A Reckless Maiden. A Day of Truth.

Oil has never been more important in funding unstable, anti- American governments and yet we have failed to make the investments necessary to move more rapidly to alternative fuels, a policy that is now as important to our national security and our Mideast strategy as to our economy and environment. The lost opportunities of the years since September 11th are the stuff of tragedy. Remember the people rallying in sympathy on the streets of Tehran; the famous headline, We are all Americans now. Five years later, much of the world wonders what America is now. As we face this landscape of failure and disorder, nothing is more urgent than for us to begin again to rebuild a bipartisan consensus to ensure our interests, increase our security and advance our values. It could well start with what our founders had in mind when they pledged a decent respect for the opinions of mankind in the Declaration of Independence. I think it's fair to say we are now all internationalists and we are all realists. This administration's choices were false ones: internationalism versus unilateralism, realism versus idealism. Is there really any argument that America must remain a preeminent leader for peace and freedom, and yet we must be more willing to work in concert with other nations and international institutions to reach common goals? The American character is both idealistic and realistic. Why can't our government reflect that? I want to suggest three principles I believe should underlie a bipartisan consensus on national security, and consider how they apply to some of the most difficult challenges we face. First, and most obviously, we must by word and deed renew internationalism for a new century. We did not face World War II alone. We did not face the Cold War alone. And we cannot face the global terrorist threat or other profound challenges alone either. A terrorist cell may recruit in Southeast Asia, train in Central Asia, find funds in the Middle East and plan attacks in the U.S. or Europe. We can stop a deadly disease anywhere along the line as it hop- scotches from continent to continent, or we can wait until it arrives at our own doors. We can deal with climate change together now or excuse its calamitous consequences later. We can turn our back on international institutions or we can modernize and revitalize them and, when needed, get about the hard work of creating new ones. Second, we must value diplomacy as well as a strong military. We should not hesitate to engage in the world's most difficult conflicts on a diplomatic front. We cannot leave the Middle East to solve itself, or avoid direct talks with North Korea. When faced with an existential challenge to the life of our nation, President Kennedy said, Let us never negotiate from fear, but let us never fear to negotiate. Direct negotiations are not a sign of weakness; they're a sign of leadership. Third, our foreign policy must blend both idealism and realism in the service of American interests. If there's one idea that has been floated about over the last six years that I would like to see debunked, with all due respect to some of the political scientists in the room, it is this false choice between realism and idealism. Is it realist or idealist to stop nuclear proliferation? Is it realist or idealist to come together on global warming? Is it realist or idealist to help developing nations educate their children, fight diseases and grow their economies? And is it realist or idealist to believe we must turn around the ideology underpinning terrorism? Strategies with respect to all of the problems we face require a mix of both, and each requires building that consensus approach; that we then have to do the hard work of bringing others to our side. We cannot achieve any of the solutions that we need to be pursuing without American leadership and we cannot achieve any of them alone. American foreign policy exists to maintain our security and serve our national interests. And in an increasingly interdependent world, it is in our interests to stand for human rights, to promote religious freedom, democracy, women's rights, social justice and economic empowerment. But reality informs us we cannot force others -- nations and peoples -- to accept those values. We have to support those who embrace them, and lead by example. At our best, Americans have always lived in a creative tension between idealism and realism, between our clear-eyed insistence on seeing the world as it actually is and our deeply held desire to remake the world as it ought to be. This administration has abandoned that tension for a simplistic division of the world into good and evil. They've refused to talk to anyone on the evil side and some have called that idealistic. I call it dangerously unrealistic. At the end of the day, you have to question whether this administration has led with our values or used our values as a cloak to justify its ideology and unilateralism. Something is wrong when our pursuit of idealistic goals has turned a good portion of the world against us. Earlier this year, a progressive and conservative, Anatol Lieven and John Hulsman, wrote a book together called Ethical Realism. You don't have to accept all of their policy proposals to learn something from the common ground they found. They remind us of a time when America's leading Protestant theologian, Reinhold Niebuhr, cautioned us against believing that God was on our side; of a time when President Dwight David Eisenhower rejected rhetoric about a preemptive attack on the Soviet Union by asking, among other things, the practical question of how we would occupy the vast country if we won; of a time when the editor of Foreign Affairs invited a little-known diplomat named George Kennan to publish an article, an anonymous article, that established the bipartisan foundation of our Cold War foreign policy. In every era, we wrestle with how to reconcile the pragmatic with the moral elements of our strength and what we choose to do with both. We got it right, mostly, during the Cold War, when realists and idealists, together, built the institutions and policies serving our interests and our values. We got it drastically wrong when a small group of ideologues decided we didn't need those institutions or alliances or diplomacy or even the respect of other nations. These principles would force a sea change from the current administration's policies. If you look at the dangerous situations we face today in Iraq, Afghanistan, Iran, North Korea, the proliferation of deadly weapons, the prosecution of the war on terror, you will see the same mistakes repeated over and over. The mistaken belief that alliances, international institutions, all of that irrelevant to American interests; the mistaken belief that diplomacy, even if backed by force, is synonymous with weakness; the mistaken belief that our military's experience in war planning, our intelligence community's objective analysis and our diplomats' experience in negotiations could be dismissed and replaced with ideological wishful thinking; and in Iraq, the mistake of waging a preemptive war based on faulty intelligence, fanciful scenarios and bluster has turned out to be a one-time-only doctrine, with no deterrent effect. We need to return to patient diplomacy, backed by military strength and informed by American values. Let me start with Iraq, because in human terms this has been a horrible month. We mourn the loss of more than 100 American servicemembers and many hundreds more Iraqis. In political terms, we have finally reached the point of complete absurdity. The administration announces it will propose timetables or benchmarks and the Iraqi prime minister denounces them. President Bush says we are adjusting tactics, but Secretary Rumsfeld insists we are staying the course. The administration tells Iran and Syria they're responsible for helping to keep the peace, but won't talk with them about how to do it. We continue to deny evident reality, proceeding with few -- or no -- allies and precious little direct communication with people who matter. No wonder the American people think we are adrift. We need a fundamental change in course, and I believe there are three basic parts to that. First, we need to press consistently, privately and publicly the Iraqis to become serious about achieving an internal reconciliation and political solution and present real consequences for their failing to do so. Only the Iraqi government can take action to create the condition for a political settlement. Instead, the government in recent days seems to be going out of its way to rebuff our efforts to move in that direction. American credibility is held hostage by an Iraqi government that will not fulfill its pledge to seek a political resolution of the rights and roles of the Sunni minority and to determine how oil revenue is allocated. For several years -- actually since the summer of 2003 -- I have pushed the idea that we should establish in Iraq an oil trust, guaranteeing that every individual Iraqi would share part of the country's oil wealth every year. Instead, the oil distribution remains unsettled. Sunnis have no incentive to stop fighting, Kurds have no incentive to operate within Iraq, and Shiites have no incentive to stop participating in militias and internecine conflict. Guaranteeing every Iraqi a share of the oil revenues at the individual level is one way to try to begin to move beyond the impasse and to give Iraqis some reason to believe, number one, we aren't there for oil; we aren't there to support big oil; we aren't there to line the pockets of the new Iraqi elite and fatten their Swiss bank accounts; and to give the Iraqis, also, some reason to feel positive about their national government. Second, we do need what many of us have been calling for now for months, even years at this point: a public international conference of the parties in the region -- the Turks, the Saudis, Egyptians, the Emirates, the Jordanians, but also the Syrians and Iranians. We need to put everybody on the record as to whether they will make public commitments to respect Iraq's sovereignty and to further the task of Iraq's stability. Instead of fearing to negotiate, we should fear what happens if we never attempt to negotiate a regional commitment to a stable, unified Iraq. And also Iraq's neighbors should fear that as well. They would bear the brunt of an all-out civil war, including millions of fleeing refugees and new bases for regional terrorist operations. And thirdly, we do need to begin -- I had hoped by the end of this year -- a phased redeployment. I joined with Senators Levin and Reed and the Democratic leadership in the Senate and the House in proposing a phased redeployment of U.S. troops from Iraq during this year, 2006. That would also include a change in the mission of U.S. forces to one of training and supporting Iraqi troops and targeting counterterrorism (sic) as well as protecting American operations and personnel and facilities. Richard Holbrooke in his recent article is right; we really have three choices: We muddle along, not necessarily going forward, but, as my chairman on the Armed Services Committee, John Warner, has said, moving sideways; we begin some kind of sensible, prudent de- escalation; or we escalate. And we can't do any of those in the absence of either the full-hearted attempt on the part of the reconciliation front, the oil allocation front and the regional parties being involved. But however we proceed, it is time to insist that the Iraqis take the lead and demonstrate to the Iraqi people, first and foremost, that the United States will not be in Iraq permanently; that American troops will not be put in the crossfire of a civil war. Phased redeployment will get the attention of the Iraqi leadership. In my meetings with members of that leadership, there has been a mixed message at best. We are a sovereign nation, they tell me. We make decisions now. And by the way, we're not ready for you to leave. It is time for us to force the Iraqi government to face up to that contradiction and to begin to do more to resolve their own political situation and make it clear that American forces will not be there to prop up their denial and refusal to deal with the problems at hand. Now, we talk a great deal, as we must, about Iraq, and not enough about Afghanistan, where our failures have squandered much of what our military accomplished and limited the reach and positive impact of President Karzai's moderate democratic government. Three years ago, when I was here, I told the council about meeting an American soldier in Afghanistan who greeted me with these words: Welcome to the forgotten front line in the war on terror. Well, today, we have senior NATO military officials predicting that the country could fall back to the Taliban in six months. The use of suicide bombings and other terror tactics is on the rise. Afghanistan is now responsible for 87 percent of the world's opium production. And a quote making the rounds in Kabul sums the situation up nicely. The Taliban commander supposedly boasted to his captors that, You have watches, but we have time. To prove him wrong, we need to give our Afghan allies time, yet all we seem to do is check our watches. Convinced, first, that we had all the answers, and then that we could subcontract out counterinsurgency to our allies, we seem to have gone on autopilot. Inattention and false optimism are not only endangering all that we accomplished there, they are costing lives. It is a great and brave thing that our allies from Canada, Britain, the Netherlands and other NATO countries have done by sending troops to Afghanistan. But Afghanistan and NATO need us as a leading partner to help with security, to root out corruption, to find alternatives to opium, and to improve the security situation with Pakistan. We know the general area where the leaders of the Taliban and probably the leaders of Al Qaida are. It's a failure of our policies on all fronts that five years later they are sending waves of fighters into Afghanistan from their safe haven. The stakes are unbearably high for Afghanistan, for Pakistan, for the country's northern neighbors in central Asia, for the reach of Al Qaida and for our own credibility and leadership. We should begin by responding to our NATO commander's call for more troops in Afghanistan where on a per capita basis we have spent 25 times less than we spent in Bosnia and deployed 1/50 as many troops. In Iran as well, this administration outsourced its policy to the British, the French and the Germans. Meanwhile, the Iranian so-called moderates we ignored were pushed out of power and the extremists went merrily forward. Now we are left hoping that those same moderates we wouldn't talk to can regain control. Hope is not a policy. U.S. policy must be unequivocal. Iran must not build or acquire nuclear weapons. Iran's president has made a series of incendiary, outrageous comments, questioning the Holocaust, calling for Israel to be wiped off the map. We know that a nuclear Iran poses a direct threat to its neighbors in the region, with Israel as its chief target. It also poses a significant threat to the United States, by combining access to nuclear materials and technology with support for terrorists whose aim is to attack and kill Americans. We have to keep all options on the table, including being ready to talk directly to Iranians should the right opportunity present itself. Direct talks, if they do nothing else, let you assess who's making decision, what their stated and unstated goals might be. And willingness to talk sends two very important messages: first, to the Iranian people, that our quarrel is with their leaders, not with them; and second, to the international community, that we are pursuing every available peaceful avenue to prevent Iran from becoming a nuclear power. We also need to be willing to use the tools available to us in working with the Israelis and the Palestinians. In part because the administration chose to disengage at crucial moments, we are now at a very discouraging place. There is no reliable partner on the Palestinian side, and still no willingness to take a clear stand of acceptance toward Israel. In the aftermath of the Palestinian elections that gave rise to Hamas, we need to continue to insist that any Palestinian government recognize Israel's right to exist and cease terrorism. However, there are reports from the region of discussions between the Israeli government and President Abbas, and of the possible dissolution of the Hamas government. As events unfold, we need to be prepared, in close coordination with our Israeli ally, to resume America's indispensable role in finding a just and lasting resolution. In North Korea, we got some potentially good news this morning. This administration has adopted a narrow and, you know, sort of, self-reinforcing world view that doesn't look at the facts and that rules out some of our best tools for defusing threats before they threaten us. We have six years of policy with no carrots, no sticks and only bad results. And we basically left negotiations to the Chinese and left Kim Jong Il home alone with no inspectors watching his plutonium. Now we have fewer options and a much more difficult task. We have U.N. sanctions, though they're not as tough as I would want. We need to enforce them. We have the six-party talks and apparently, based on what we heard this morning, after intensive discussions that included direct talks between Ambassador Chris Hill and the North Koreans, we are going to revive the six-party process. We can't take anything off the table. We've had troops in South Korea for 50 years for a reason. But I have fought for a long time we made a mistake not talking directly to North Korea. North Korea's neighbors have long supported direct U.S.-North Korean talks on security matters. In the past, such engagement has prevented the development of plutonium bombs and the testing of long- range missiles. Kim Jong Il needs to hear a single, unified message: Choose between nuclear weapons and aid from South Korea, China and the international community; you can not have both. Right now, we seem to be relying, too much for my taste, on China's good will to restrain North Korea. At the end of the day, Pyongyang will have to hear this message directly from us. The common strand that draws these crises together is the threat that sophisticated terrorists, operating out of Afghanistan or Iraq or somewhere else, will be able to acquire nuclear weapons or materials. For 40 years, the U.S. provided bipartisan leadership in building a network of treaties and expectations that kept global nuclear ambitions in check. Countries like Brazil and Argentina and South Africa and Kazakhstan and Ukraine and Belarus elected not to develop nuclear weapons or even gave up weapons they had, giving terrorists fewer opportunities as a result. Today we face intense extremist efforts to buy or steal either a bomb or the material to make one. And it doesn't have to be very big. We also are seeing increased interest in peaceful uses of nuclear power on the part of many legitimate states. In response, we need to modernize the nonproliferation treaties and related agreements. Last year we had the chance to start talking about what a stronger regime would look like at the Non-Proliferation Treaty review conference. But while other countries sent foreign ministers or senior ambassadors, the administration sent a mid-level official a clear signal it just wasn't interested. Our influence is already been eroded by our abandonment of the comprehensive test ban treaty and the administration's interest in developing two new small nuclear weapons, including the robust nuclear earth penetrator, the so-called bunker buster. The wholesale abandonment of nonproliferation efforts is a serious mistake. The more countries that have fissile material, the more opportunities for it to go astray. American experts, like those working at the council, have made innovative proposals for a 21st-century NPT. When the Senate resumes, I'll be asking my colleagues who chair the Armed Services and Foreign Relations Committees to hold joint hearings on the future of a nonproliferation policy with the aim of creating a new blueprint for our shared security. And we have to increase our efforts on preventing terrorist groups from obtaining nuclear weapons or materials. You know, Sam Nunn and Ted Turner with the Nuclear Threat Initiative have said over and over again we aren't doing enough to get every last bit of weapons grade material under safeguard. I will be introducing a bill based on their ideas which would create a senior White House adviser for countering nuclear terrorism, require a yearly report that would specify every site with nuclear material or weapons. And we would do what we have to do, working in concert with other nations, to try to make that material as safe as it can be. Here in New York, we don't need anyone to tell us we're in a war against terrorists who seek to do us harm. Strategically, it is also true that the world is watching us. We are unlikely to make headway facing the challenges that I've discussed, and many others, if we are seen as losing ground to the terrorists. On September 12th, 2001, when the Bush administration could count on the good will of the entire world, they had strong support from both parties and the determination of the American people to sacrifice for a common cause. That call to sacrifice never came. Five years later, the administration has failed to transform our national security institutions. The people who promised less government have instead given us the largest and least competent government we've ever had. As a result, our front-line fighters in the war against terrorists often lack the tools they need. The administration has ordered our military to fulfill missions for which it is not sized, equipped or funded. I joined with other Democrats and Republicans in proposing that we expand the Army by 80,000 troops; that we move faster to expand the special forces and do a better job of training and equipping the National Guard and Reserves. The administration has failed embarrassingly when it comes to homeland security. Last week, the council's own Stephen Flynn awarded them three Ds or Fs and four Cs our of nine grades on homeland security. That's not good enough. The administration has failed to create a culture of prevention within the FBI. Last December, the 9/11 Commission gave administration efforts at the FBI a C and said, unless there is improvement within a reasonable period of time, Congress will have to look at alternatives. The FBI still has only 33 Arabic-speaking agents and none is assigned to counterterrorism. The agency's top counterterrorism job has turned over six times in five years. And we have yet to see the completion of reform in the intelligence community and the restoration of morale. The 9/11 Commission package envisioned a director of national intelligence who actually directed the intelligence community. We don't have that. We're still living in a need-to-know culture instead of a need-to-share one. The administration's supposed new standards on interrogation and torture have left our CIA personnel, and even our military unsure of what is legal to do, what they're authorized to do, what their country wants them to do. During the Cuban missile crisis, President Kennedy had at his side Llewelyn Thompson, former ambassador to Moscow, who understood the Soviets and had even lived with Premier Khrushchev. We don't have that expertise any longer inside our government when it comes to the threats we face from Islamic extremism. When we need to look beyond our intelligence community, as we did during the Cold War, we challenged a generation of universities and students to serve their country. We should do the same today. Learn the languages that we need. Understand the cultures of the societies where our biggest threats are incubating. Our military commanders make a point of telling us we cannot win the war against terrorism through military means alone. As the new Army and Marine manual on counterinsurgency puts it: The best weapons for counterinsurgency do not shoot. Pete said when he introduced me that I work as a member of the U.S. Joint Forces Command Transformation Advisory Group. One of the common themes of our work there is that we don't have enough civilian capacity to manage pre- and post-crisis situations. The world has changed, but our civilian institutions and preparation for public service have not kept up. I recently introduced legislation, along with Senator Specter, to create a public service academy, a West Point for public service, that would send a message about the importance of civilian preparedness and response at home and abroad. It could become a place where we teach critical languages and put a high priority on learning about those cultures we so poorly understand today. You know, finally, it comes down to whether we can win the war on terror, not just the battle. And that requires we face squarely our long-term challenge of putting the U.S. on the side of dignity and progress and making it clear that we do oppose tyranny and violations of human rights. And in that fight, our only realistic weapons are our values and ideals. We need to start by addressing the troubled conditions terrorists seek out. I have focused on support for global education because I think it provides an alternative in places where the only schools are also incubators of religiously-fueled extremism. And it returns immediate health and social gains and reinforces our basic value of equality. I introduced legislation for our country to take the lead in education for all, to aim at giving every child in the world access at least to primary education by 2015. We've done a good job talking about democracy but we sure haven't done a comparable good job in promoting the long-term efforts that actually build institutions after the elections are over and the international monitors have gone home. We have to give citizens more tools and we should be talking more about the successes of this administration, the relief efforts after the tsunami and the earthquake in Pakistan, the global AIDS program, the Millennium Challenge grants. They're seldom emphasized and they often seem to run counter to the basic ideological argument the administration is making. This month I was one of 34 members of the Senate to vote against President Bush's military commissions act. On the floor of the Senate, I recounted a choice that General George Washington made 230 years ago. New York City and Long Island had been captured. Washington and the Continental Army had retreated across New Jersey to Pennsylvania, suffering tremendous casualties. Here in New York, American prisoners, often held in the hulls of boats anchored in the harbor off of Brooklyn, were suffering unspeakably at the hands of the British. The cause of American independence was in doubt. Then Washington won the Battle of Trenton, capturing nearly 1,000 prisoners of war, and he had to decide what to do with them. The order he gave should still speak to us: Treat them with humanity and let them have no reason to complain of our copying the brutal example of the British army in their treatment of our unfortunate brethren. America was born out of faith in certain basic principles and out of an understanding that it matters deeply -- in fact, it matters for our survival, that we hew to those principles at home and in the eyes of the world. There can be no mercy for those who perpetrated 9/11 and other crimes against humanity, but we have to pursue justice in a way that lifts up our values, the rule of law and sets an example we can point to with pride, not shame. That is an utterly realistic brand of idealism that has been with us since our beginnings. The administration's experiment has failed. We cannot go backwards, we must go forward, building that new consensus and risking a new bipartisanship. I cannot speak, of course, for the administration. But I know that my Democratic colleagues are ready to do so. Thank you very much. (APPLAUSE) MODERATOR: Hillary, thank you very much. You know, just before we came in, you and I began a conversation. You said maybe we ought to continue it a bit. And taking the prerogative of the (inaudible), let me reinitiate it with you, because I'd be very much interested in your reactions. I've been around a long, long time, and I don't think I've ever seen a time in this country where there are so many long-term challenges defined by two or three criteria: number one, virtually all the experts from both parties agree on the magnitude and the existence of the problem; second, that all or most of them agree they're unsustainable; and yet, in spite of that, we do nothing about them. We seem dysfunctionally paralyzed. I give you the entitlement problem, with its massive burdens on our kids in taxes and debts. I give you our current account deficit, which, if we continue at these levels, we end up looking a bit like a Third World country, with huge debt service. I refer you to our health care problem, which, it seems to me, threatens to devour our resources and not have other resources we desperately need for research and development; our energy gluttony, that puts us in a position of both financing and making us even more vulnerable to some of our worst enemies and the related first-cousin, the environment. So my question to you would be the following: Do you share my concern about our lack of response to these kinds of problems? And if so, what do we do about them? Is there some new approach or, B, is there a crisis that will be required? And I know this is not directly related to foreign policy, but in a sense it very much is. CLINTON: It is very much related to foreign policy because, in the absence of a strong American economy that is able to deal with the challenges that Pete have just mentioned, from health care to energy, we undermine our leadership around the world; we are ceding our fiscal sovereignty as we speak because of our indebtedness, our rather remarkable transformation to the world's biggest debtor nation. So it is intimately related. And I share your concerns. And to me it comes down to leadership. Obviously, I think we do better when we have a bipartisan consensus, not only in foreign policy but in addressing some of these other issues. And it requires, though, not only public sector leadership, but I would add it requires private sector leadership as well. We need an American commitment, across the political spectrum but also from those who create the wealth, those who create the jobs, those who are globally knowledgeable about what we confront, to be part of speaking out for that kind of leadership and those solutions. You know, I'm always amazed when I go back and look at what Truman and Marshall did after World War II to create the extraordinary commitment to rebuilding Japan and Germany, to investing in other people's freedoms in other parts of the world and the fight against communism at the beginning stages of the Cold War. You know, can you imagine an American president today going and saying, We've been taxing you at confiscatory rates for years now to fund this world war, we've sent you off to fight and die, we've seen the worst that humanity can do, and we're going to keep taxing you at confiscatory rates because we've got to go rebuild the enemies that we have just defeated? It would last, like, a nanosecond on talk radio. (LAUGHTER) And one of the reasons that it eventually succeeded is because Truman enlisted the business community to make the case. It was an idealistic and a realistic approach. Realistically, we needed to try to have new markets and have a different outcome after the Second World War than we did after the first, and Germany in particular. But it was idealistic as well, that we could over time, with patience, develop democracy. I feel that we're at a comparable period now. And I have, as you have heard and as you might guess, many specific critiques of the president's policies on both domestic and foreign issues. But my biggest regret is that after 9/11, when the country was truly ready to follow wherever he led, he didn't tackle these problems. If the president had come to the Republican-dominated Congress after 9/11 and said, We need an energy policy that puts us on a fast track toward at least less dependence, if not independence, which is quite a difficult goal, he would have gotten it. If the president had come and said, We've got to figure out how we're going to deal with this deficit, so I don't know what the future holds; we're going to have so many costs related to the war on terror; we need to take a deep breath here; no more tax cuts until we figure out where we are financially, this Congress would have done it. And he could have been re-elected in his second term with a very big majority. Now, it would have required him turning away from some of the more radical ideological elements of his base, but he could have had a broad majority support across the country, and that hasn't happened. And now we're going to have to figure out how to create it in, yes, a polarized, divided electorate. We're going to need leadership at all levels of government and, as I say, in the private and not-for- profit sector. MODERATOR: Thank you. Let's start here. QUESTION: Senator, even though you spoke about the issues of North Korea, Iran, the Middle East, but with all these big issues we tend to forget our neighbors to the south. And I wanted to ask you questions on one specific one, which is Mexico, which is obviously very important to us. And what are your views with this new government in Mexico, your views on the government, our relations with Mexico, the issue of the border, on the fence, and also the issue of the 12 million undocumented workers that we have here in the U.S.? CLINTON: Thank you very much. You're right, we have given short shrift to Latin America, and we are paying for it. And today I didn't talk about it, or didn't talk at length about China or Russia or what's happening in Africa, which I've very concerned about, with the collapse of a lot of these regimes and Islamists moving into the vacuum. There's a lot that we have on our plate that doesn't get into the headlines. But specifically with Latin America -- and you know so well, having served as an ambassador in Chile -- that we have not been able to maintain the relationships that were nurtured during the '90s to support democracy, to support market economies. And people have been voting in a very clear message that they weren't benefiting from these policies and we were not really there trying to help them work better. Mexico is such an important problem on our doorstep. I hope that the new government will have a concerted commitment to a jobs program to employ Mexicans. I mean, honestly, I wish they would go back and dust off the WPA. There is so much work to be done in Mexico, there is so much infrastructure. And it's a classic case of a very small, relatively small number of people reaping the benefits of the natural resources and the economic prosperity that doesn't trickle down. And it is so unfortunate because Mexico right now is poised to have a tremendous forward movement with its economy and with its political and social structure. I don't know what the new president will do. Obviously, the person running against him, Lopez Obrador, had a very different approach and was very outspoken and even quite confrontational about what should be done. It would be great politics and it would have lasting impact if this new so-called more conservative government would actually deal with the conditions on the ground in Mexico. I heard just recently, in talking about the problems we have on our border, that hundreds of thousands of guest workers from Central America are brought into Mexico every year because they will work for less than the poor Mexicans will work for. And, in effect, the Mexican government's policies are pushing migration north across our border. And there can be no long-term resolution unless economic growth increases in Mexico and unless there is some commitment to its equitable distribution. Very briefly, on immigration, I hope that we get back to comprehensive immigration reform. We've had an unfortunate political season where the issue has been used as a political football. There isn't any sensible approach except to do what we need to do, simultaneously: Secure our borders with technology, personnel, physical barriers if necessary in some places; and we need to have tougher employer sanctions; and we need to try to incentivize Mexico to do more; and we need to create the environment in which we get people out of the shadows and then give them some earned right to legalization that will enable them to continue to work. If they've committed transgressions of whatever kind, they should be obviously deported. But that won't stop it unless Mexico and their neighbors to the south actually let these hard-working people have a future in their own countries. These are people who are willing to work but, for them, there is no future in where they came from. And that is a problem that the governments of their country and we should be trying to address. QUESTION: Senator, that was a brilliant speech. CLINTON: I always call on my friends. (LAUGHTER) QUESTION: Where do you think we ought to go in respect of Cuba? CLINTON: Well, I think we're in a waiting game. And I don't think there's anything that's going to change until we know what happens to Fidel. There's not going to be any changes on their side and there are not going to be changes on our side. This is a very intractable political problem here in our country. I hope there will be come opening to try to figure out a more effective approach, to exercise more real influence by us into a post- Castro, but I think we're just in a holding pattern right now. QUESTION: Sudan's President Bashir has rejected the Security Council's suggestion for a peacekeeping operation. What do you think the right balance is between the responsibility to protect and the rights of sovereign states? Under what circumstances would you support a humanitarian corridor and a non-consensual deployment to create safe havens? CLINTON: Well, you know, I know how much you and the foundation have really been involved in this terrible issue. And I commend you for it. I don't know if Nick Kristof is here, but he had a terrific column about a couple of days ago, outlining a very detailed plan of action that I hope somebody in the State Department is reading. I would support having a continuing presence with a high-level envoy that actually get back to the peace talks that fell apart with the rebel groups. It was kind of like done on the fly. We weren't really that committed to it, from my observation. We made an agreement with a minor party and then we basically left and declared victory. We're getting to be very good at declaring victory. That seems to be our PR strategy on nearly everything we deal with these days. (LAUGHTER) And we've got to get serious again about that. We've got to force the Sudanese, the government from Khartoum, to get back to the table. I think we need to beef up peacekeeping forces, whether they're from the African Union or elsewhere in Chad, because this is spilling over into Chad. And I think we should consider some kind of humanitarian corridor. Now, you know as well as anyone in this room -- and that's why I mentioned Russia and China pursuing their own interests; often at odds with global imperatives like nonproliferation and genocide in Darfur because the Chinese and the Russians are particularly allergic to any kind of internal intervention. And that's why we need a different approach. The work that Kofi Annan commissioned with the reform proposals that came out of the high-level group that was appointed -- there were some very good ideas in there that would be particularly applicable to this situation; most particularly, the responsibility to protect. So I am open to taking much more vigorous action. But we are in a bind. And it gets back to Pete's point. And I say this all the time as I travel around upstate because I think it's important for people to recognize, you know, because we're now the world's largest debtor nation, we have to hope, every morning, central bankers in Beijing and Tokyo and Seoul and Riyadh and everybody wake up and continue to buy our debt instruments. When it comes to trying to enforce trade agreements, to put the issue of currency manipulation on the table, or to deal with Darfur, we are now at a disadvantage. You know, how do you get tough on your banker? How do you try to create the leverage that is needed? So it's not just in the direct areas that you can point to that we're not succeeding. It's in the atmosphere that has been created by the policy choices that have been made by the Congress and the president over the last six years that have given us a weakened hand. And I think that's very clear, in dealing with Darfur. QUESTION: Currency at the U.N.: We have many, many resolutions and frustration by the international community, invoking Chapter 6, Chapter 7 sanctions, and there's just no response. At the rate we are going, the strength of the U.N. is certainly going to be undermined, if it's not by now. What is your vision for the United Nations and our relationship to the U.N.? CLINTON: Well, you know, I'm glad you asked that because I alluded -- obviously, I didn't have time to go into any detail -- about what I see as a need for a process to begin where we try, seriously, to assess the international institutions that we have; obviously, the U.N. being foremost, but you can look at IMF, World Bank. There's a group of them, most of which came into being after World War II in response to the Cold War and horrors of the war. And I believe very strongly that we need more multilateral and regional alliances; NATO being the clearest example of what's worked. But it's taken a lot of tending and care. You don't just set these things up and expect them to do America's bidding. You've got to be involved, you have to be constantly trying to reform and revitalize them. We don't have many tools in our current tool box to deal with rogue regimes, to try to bring pressure on an Iran or a North Korea. And the United Nations, for all of its, you know, problems -- which are legion -- is basically captive to the Security Council when it comes to the really serious issues that we confront. And if we don't have a better atmosphere in which to deal particularly with China and Russia on some of these intractable problems, you know, we could have the U.N. or not have the U.N., we're not going to make a difference. And so I would like to see us, you know, take some of the steps that were recommended to try to reform and revitalize the United Nations. But I have no illusions that that will automatically answer everything that ails us. I think we need to try to create a new level of responsible leadership among nations that are now assuming greater roles in the world like China, like Russia, like India. You know, they need to be part of us creating a new set of rules to guide us by. And we're not there yet. And so I think that I support the United Nations because we have no alternative. When people criticize it or condemn it and then they turn around and ask that we get sanctions against somebody, it just shows you the contradiction, because we haven't yet grasped the reality that we need to rethink this, we need to have a greater level of commitment from some of the leading nations in order to deal with these problems. And we don't have that right now. So the U.N. is basically what we've got. And I don't like seeing it demeaned and denigrated, when we have to turn around and rely on it. I'd rather see us begin to try to put into place a process that could perhaps create some either different configurations or even new institutions, which I think are badly needed. MODERATOR: We're a couple of minutes late, but there's been a young lady in the third row here that's been waiting a long time. QUESTION: Thanks for the young, Pete. (LAUGHTER) Senator, you're rarely in a room, probably, where as many people will go to the polls next week. My question is, I'm sure the comptroller of the state of New York has something to do with foreign policy. And since Pete said something that wasn't so foreign policy- ish... (LAUGHTER) ... my question is: What would you advise, as a person who is on the ticket, we do when clearly the Republican is incompetent and everyone else has asked for the resignation of the Democrat? (LAUGHTER) CLINTON: Can we get back to talking about nuclear proliferation? (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) We are at a very difficult juncture because even if he were to resign tomorrow, there's no way to place a substitute on the ballot. I do believe, with you, that the alternative is totally unqualified to manage the huge responsibilities of the pension fund and the investments that are within the jurisdiction of the comptroller. There seems to be a commitment on the part of the soon-to-be new governor and legislative leadership that they will commence a process after the election -- you know, they couldn't get it done before the election, for obvious reasons -- but, after the election, to determine whether, if he succeeds in the elections, which I personally hope, because I think it's better than the alternative, whether he will at that point resign, whether he will be subjected to a process in the legislature, and if he's removed or if he resigns, then the new governor gets to appoint a qualified comptroller. So look, this is not a pleasant situation for a lot of us who are friends of his. And I personally believe he did a lot of good things as comptroller. But he did something that was wrong. And it was not only wrong, it was, according to the state ethics probe, illegal. And, you know, you have to be held accountable for that. And so I think that the process is as I've just described. So I'm voting for him. Chuck Schumer's voting for him. We think it's the better of some very bad alternatives. MODERATOR: Hillary, thank you so much. I hope we don't have to wait three more years. (LAUGHTER) CLINTON: Thank you all.

Because there are more nonprofits than profit-making organizations in the county, the issue is important.   Unquestionably, financing operations    has    become more difficult for nonprofits. But not just because of the two reasons cited, the downturn in the economy and cutbacks in public funds.   Fund-raising, like other forms of human activity, has reference to Pareto's Law","excerpt":"a relatively few causes account for most results. Thus, a relatively few givers responding to a relatively few signals provide most of the money raised in any campaign and for any organization. To cite one example of this law in action locally, there would be no Westchester Council on the Arts if the county government and I.B.M. refused to make annual grants.   The major issue for nonprofits, as Peter Drucker writes in his recent book, \\"Managing the Nonprofit Organization,\\" is that too many have no clear sense what their missions are. Defining a specific purpose became less and less important when public funds poured in. Good intentions sufficed. But inevitably, this joyful period had to end. And just as the shift in financing from private to public funds that began in the mid-1960's confused nonprofits, today's shifts from public funding back to private-sector funding utterly confuses nonprofit staffs.   It also confuses people who might under other circumstances contribute to nonprofits. To raise money, an organization should define for prospective givers a purpose that they think right and reasonable. The public has to believe that with its limited resources, it can do something about the problem cited. To ask people to contribute because government has cut back or the economy has faltered is to present them with reasons    not    to give. What can they do, if governments and the wealthiest people in the community can't really help?   Moreover, today we have dozens of black, women's and homosexual groups that reflect the needs of their respective constituencies. These groups don't fit United Way qualifications for membership. Guided by its by-laws and history, United Way has no choice but to exclude them.   But that doesn't mean that black, women's, and homosexual groups cannot or will not raise money and thus negate consolidated local fund-raising efforts. On the contrary, these groups will become far more competitive and successful in the future.

But as an overall performance, this one failed to cohere into a moving statement of this extraordinary Mozart masterpiece.    Part of that failure is endemic: only functionally rehearsed, internationally cast performances in a horseshoe-shaped, 4,000-seat theater, sung in Italian without supertitles so that the audience sits placidly, with comic points conveyed by crude exaggeration. Despite weaker singing in every major role, the recent performance with supertitles in the 1,800-seat New Brunswick (N.J.)

And Bear in Mind  (Editors' choices of other recent books of particular interest)    BEING DEAD, by Jim Crace. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $21.) Biology is applied to biologists in this blunt novel, which begins with a dead couple, professors of zoology, then flashes back to see how they came so and forward to watch them decompose.    BLUE ANGEL, by Francine Prose. (HarperCollins, $25.) The sexes and the generations no longer speak in this high comic novel, in which a middle-aged professor is the target of the student he supposes he is exploiting.    DREAMBIRDS: The Strange History of the Ostrich in Fashion, Food, and Fortune, by Rob Nixon. (Picador USA, $23.) Camouflaged as natural history, ode to gawky beauty (great legs, lipstick, lashes to die for) and social study of precarious empires built on feathers, this book is at bottom a haunting memoir of the author's South African boyhood.    THE FEAST OF LOVE, by Charles Baxter. (Pantheon, $24.) A luminous he-said-she-said of a novel, in which He (a handsome toadlike man) and She (Ex-Wife No. 1) unspool contrary narratives of their life together, with cameos by Ex-Wife No. 2 and a pair of love-drunk slackers, played out on a stage shot through with moonlight and inky shadow.    THE HUMAN STAIN, by Philip Roth. (Houghton Mifflin, $26.) The novel's doomed protagonist is a modern converso: a black man passing as a Jew so he'll be taken for white. Our old friend Nathan Zuckerman tells his story, which explores the freighted border between transformation and trespass.    IN THE FALL, by Jeffrey Lent. (Atlantic Monthly, $25.) Yes, a wounded soldier walks home from the Civil War, but this novel emerges from the shadow of ''C--- M-------'' to tell of the hero's marriage to a runaway slave and their family's disturbing legacy.    MR. PHILLIPS, by John Lanchester. (Marian Wood/Putnam, $24.95.) When the accountant at the center of this novel is fired, he begins a curious new life, involving a bungee jumper, performance art and a blue movie (these are three separate things).    RAILS UNDER MY BACK, by Jeffery Renard Allen. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $26.)

The 1 percent tax on payrolls of at least $2,500 would raise an estimated $5 million for the quarter.          Because Jersey City passed its ordinance imposing the tax during the fourth  quarter of 1995, \\"We're going to bill it in the fourth quarter of '95,\\" said Tom Gallagher, the Mayor's press secretary. Local businesses and labor unions oppose the payroll levy, which is meant to provide relief from soaring property taxes.  But opponents dropped a petition drive to overturn the ordinance last year after Tom DeGise, the City Council president, promised the tax would not be imposed retroactively.

But the dance is far more than the occasion piece it first seems. Ailey created a modern-dance version of a classical pas de deux, emphasizing its buried element of sexual teasing. He also captured the sassy exuberance of Ellington's music, as well as its fleeting undertone of melancholy and its melodic lushness, in five pieces that suggest Ellington's range and, physicalized onstage, the complexity of his music.

In January, for example, the high-rated funds dropped 1.6 percent while lower-quality funds lost 1.2 percent.   The reason is that lower-quality bonds are more vulnerable to recessions than their high-quality counterparts because the probability of defaults rises as the economy sours.

Coetzee. (Viking, $23.95.) The ''disgrace'' of the title belongs to the central character of this novel (winner of this year's Booker Prize in Britain), a Cape Town intellectual whose sexual sin, later visited on his daughter, is made to reflect the old guilt of white privilege.    DOUBLE DOWN: Reflections on Gambling and Loss, by Frederick Barthelme and Steven Barthelme. (Houghton Mifflin, $24.) Two brothers, both writers of distinguished fiction, tell how they lost more than $300,000 and managed to be indicted for cheating as well.    EDWARD M. KENNEDY: A Biography, by Adam Clymer.

HOMESICKNESS, by Murray Bail. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, paper, $14.) An Australian novel that cogitates on the dubious pleasures of mass tourism as a group of 13 follows a senseless itinerary through surreal and baffling museums.    THE LONG HOME, by William Gay. (MacMurray & Beck, $24.95.) This first novelist fears no theme, however large; it's good versus evil in Faulkner territory, and good succeeds only when it's better armed than evil and willing to exert violence.    LOSING NELSON, by Barry Unsworth. (Doubleday, $23.95.) A provocative, absorbing novel whose mad hero hides from his own life by his elaborate identification with Admiral Nelson, a folly he understands well enough to labor at the same time to destroy it.

A luscious Russian novel with a love story at its heart, surrounded by picaresque events in America and demanding, the author insists, frequent help from the reader.    SILENT STARS, by Jeanine Basinger. (Knopf, $35.) A film historian argues that many of the stars of the silents, especially Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks, wielded talent and cultural scope that have been forgotten as the films themselves were forgotten, lost or just unseen.    THE WALKING TOUR, by Kathryn Davis. (Houghton Mifflin, $23.) A brilliantly dexterous novel that manages to contain a 20th-century murder mystery, told in a post-global-disaster future by one victim's daughter. (The other victim was somehow responsible for the disaster.)    WALTER BENJAMIN AT THE DAIRY QUEEN: Reflections at Sixty and Beyond, by Larry McMurtry. (Simon & Schuster, $21.) A peculiar book, part memoir, part tour de force, part commonplace book, in which the author of ''Lonesome Dove'' regrets what he thinks is his failure to subvert fallacies about the Old West.

It is true that the director plays with French history, but the story of the little French milliner and her conquest of Louis XV??? makes a fascinating drama.Pola Negri is charming as the scheming, heartless ???irt, known as Mme. du Barry. She has never played a r???le better than she does the one in this film. The scenes follow on as if they had been made in the same time that it takes to screen the production. M???le. Negri's spontaneity is convincing, and the use she makes of her eyes elicits sympathy for those who fall in wild admiration before her charms. No time is lost in getting the story running. From the first instant Pola Negri appears the interest is whetted. If one has seen the production before, then there are certain sequences to which one looks forward, wondering, perhaps, how they will seem after two and a half years. To the writer they were just as excellent as in 1920.Nothing could be more charming than the interrupted luncheon where the French milliner has to conceal herself behind a screen and where she eventually meets one of her many paramours. The scene where the King kisses Mme. du Barry's foot is wonderfully well directed. Incidentally, the same idea was copied in ???Bella Donna,\\" but the censor would not permit it to pass.Whether French Kings, or Louis XV??? especially, were given to playing blind man's buff does not really matter. But it must be admitted that by putting??? in such a sequence in ???Passion,\\" Ernst Lubitsch, the director, accomplishes a good deal. He shows the foolishness of the King.Lubitsch is remarkably careful about his sets, the narrow streets with steps being exceptionally well done, giving a fine opportunity for two characters.The scenario is carefully mapped out with whimsical twists and a strong dramatic climax. Mile??? Negri is careful about her make-up, but she does seem to have put a little too much color above her eyelids. She makes the same mistake in \\"Bella Donna.\\"Emil Jannings as the king is an artist throughout the picture. First, he is seen looking through his lorgnette at ???e little milliner, who is seated on a bench in the royal gardens, and later when he meets her he plucks from her corsage the roll of parchment she wishes him to sign for du Barry. He looks full of admiration for the girl. Lubitsch scorns to think that the King ever bothers his head about affairs of state. Mme. du Barry dominates Louis??? eventually meeting her doom at the hands ??? of the mob as \\"the wickedest woman of France.\\"Jannings gives a remarkable portrayal of the King dying and his last sight of ???me. du Barry.\\"Passion\\" is well worth seeing again.

Giordano's hero bears scant resemblance to the historic Chenier, a high-born Parisian poet who championed the causes of the downtrodden but denounced their violent excesses and was executed on trumped-up charges of treason in 1794. No matter. In the opera house, this dashing role has provided some glamour tenors of the past -- Mario Del Monaco, Franco Corelli -- with a chance to exult in virile lyricism and dramatic impetuosity.         So the announcement that Luciano Pavarotti, at 60, was going to undertake his first staged Chenier in a new Metropolitan Opera production was understandably greeted with misgivings.

The music is drawn from an unsuccessful 1924 ballet, a tale of youngsters fresh from communion services at church who run afoul of a pastry shop. To his standard battery of instruments, Strauss here adds some exotic touches: sand blocks, tambourines, castanets. The music is like an overstuffed Viennese cream puff, one of those delectable desserts that you dig into greedily but can't finish. It certainly provided Mr. Jarvi with a chance to show off his orchestra's precision, power and color.         The program began with the Overture No. 2 by Veljo Tormis, Mr. Jarvi's fellow Estonian. The work is dark and agitated, with grim modal harmonies, churning figures for the strings, ominous outbursts from the brass and melodramatic volleys of snare drums and timpani.

Thousands have come to the estate for midsummer full-moon dances, Christmas parties, medieval banquets and weddings. \\n\\nBut now all of this may be coming to an end.

Officials at Wesleyan, which is across the river in Middletown, a few miles away from the property, said the sale was necessary because Wesleyan said it could no longer afford to maintain the house, which has gradually deteriorated.

The change was signaled most clearly by the Catholic President of Nicaragua,  Violeta Chamorro, who astonished Vatican officials by greeting the Pope with an enthusiastic kiss on the cheek instead of on the ring. In 1983 followers of the leftist Sandinista Government heckled the Pope, but this time the infallibly maternal Mrs. Chamorro treated him like Grandpa. After a day in Guatemala when his pallor and heavy movements gave rise to rumors that the 75-year-old Pontiff's health was failing, he seemed invigorated by the Nicaraguans' affection.

The prints have a spooky, sensual look, as if the photographer, like a medium at a Ouija board, had done nothing more than allow the light to play over the paper. The prints are so painterly and layered that it is tempting to look at them from above, from below and from the sides to see exactly how light made its strokes. In one picture of  a hunk of bread, printed on pebbly paper, the light itself appears to have dived in and out of the dough's crevices. But of course these prints were not made by  light alone.

Only a few years separated her work from that of such FSA photographers as Walker Evans and Ben Shahn, and the lives of the people she photographed were not very different from those of the people they photographed. Yet her photographs are softer and more romantic in atmosphere. The people in them seem more dignified and self-possessed. \\n\\nAt the same time, however, there is something disquieting about her photographs that links them with those of the FSA photographers. Despite the romantic atmosphere and the dignified approach, her sitters often have something odd and misshapen about them that suggests the harsher, more realistic vision of Evans and Shahn. In the long run, the similarities are perhaps more interesting than the differences.

S. Moss's Broadway. It is deserving of a better title than \\"Men in Her Life,\\" as it is called, for it is adequately staged, neatly directed and has the advantage of efficient and restrained performances by Lois Moran, Charles Bickford, Victor Varconi and Donald Dilloway.Although this narrative becomes unnecessarily melodramatic toward the close, most of the episodes are set forth with sympathetic interest and pleasing comedy. Miss Moran acts Julia Cavanaugh, an American girl of good family, who, while in France, learns that her fortune is in jeopardy through the closing of a trust company. She is at the time living in a small provincial hotel, where Count Ivan, with whom she believes she is in love, is also staying. He boasts of his ancestry and breeding, but this does not deter him from decamping early one morning with Julia's money and jewelry. At the time she is wondering how she can pay her hotel bill and travel to Paris( where she has friends. Flash Madden, an ex-racketeer of New York, played by Mr. Bickford, comes to Julia's assistance. He has a million dollars, and it is his main desire to have his manners improved. Therefore he engages Julia to coach him as to how to behave in decent society. This affords a good deal of amusement, but while Madden does his best to conduct himself in a satisfactory fashion, he is constantly reverting to type.The scene then changes to New York, where the Count threatens Julia with the publicity of really harmless letters she has written to him unless she gives him $25,000. Madden again comes to the rescue. He goes to see the Count on Julia's behalf. The blackmailer whips out a pistol just after Madden has delivered his opinion of the \\"gentleman,\\" and in the course of a struggle the Count is shot and killed.Madden proves himself to be a rough diamond by his chivalrous conduct both before and during his trial, for he refuses to mention Julia's name or tell why he went to the Count's apartment. He is, of course, duly rewarded by winning Julia's affection, Dick Webster, her fiancé, having discovered that he had no faith in her.It is a pity that Madden is so uncouth, for no matter what admiration one may feel for him one is inclined to think that it will be many years before Julia is able to give him the talked-of \\"veneer.\\" The story might have been even better if instead of having the Count killed, the producers decided to have him thrashed by Madden and then have Madden show his gallantry in some other fashion.Miss Moran is charming and capable. Mr. Bickford tackles his rôle with his usual forcefulness. Mr. Varconi does quite well with the part of the Count, especially considering that he has hitherto played on the other side of the fence.

Knight (McGraw-Hill $14.95).   Written in cooperation with the staff of the Energy Resources Center at the University of Illinois, this is an easy-to-understand, large-format 364-page hardcover manual that gives detailed instructions on how to cut down on energy waste by keeping heat inside in winter and outside in summer.   Profusely illustrated with sketches and drawings, the book makes no effort, as so many other books on energy-saving do, to go into such subjects as modernizing the heating system or installing various types of energy-saving equipment. It limits itself to telling the reader how to plug air leaks and improve insulation in walls, floors, windows and doors.

S. S. R.From the very beginning, when Tchapayef, the heroic leader of a band of Red partisans fighting against a section of the White Guards in the Urals in 1919, is seen capturing a bridge and routing the enemy, until the final reel, where he sinks beneath the waters of a river under the bullets of the reactionary troops and the film ends with the Red cavalry avenging his death, there is action, action, action. This doesn't mean that machine guns are rattling and blood flowing all the time, as there really are only three scenes of fighting, all of them highly effective. But the interest of the spectators is held every minute by the development of the story, which conforms closely to the actual historical episodes upon which it is based, and the dramatic and comic incidents scattered with a liberal hand throughout the scenario.Even hardened observers are likely to find themselves seriously following the course of the unobtrusive love affair between Anka, a textile worker serving a machine gun in the Red army, and Petkya, Tchapayef's favorite lieutenant, and to be thrilled by her devotion and skill. Then there are all sorts of humorous situations, involving peasants, Red partisans and the leader himself, and Furmanof, the political commissar attached to Tchapayef's force by the Soviet High Command. At first the rough-and-ready partisan chief mistrusts the educated young man from Moscow, but soon the latter wins his confidence and undying friendship. Many of the flashes of wit are at the expense of the partisans' and muzhiki's ignorance of what the war is all about, but there is an undercurrent of earnestness that keeps the humor from descending to the slapstick variety.This time the Bolshevist filmmakers allow the White Guard leaders and their followers to act like persons not much worse than the usual run of human kind. In fact, about the only piece of brutality charged to the colonel in command of the White troops is the allowing of the brother of his faithful old orderly, Petrovitch, to be beaten to death for attempted desertion to the Reds. One of the most impressive scenes in the whole film is when a detachment of White Guards made up of former officers charges in parade formation in an almost successful effort to break down their adversaries' morale.The young directors of the picture were fortunate in having such a fine type of actor as Boris Bobotchkin to fill the exacting rôle of Tchapayef. Despite his heroism, he remains a human being, with lots of weaknesses, but with a dash and sincerity that are winning in the extreme. Every one of the principal players is excellent and the ensemble work hardly can be excelled. The photography is at all times up to the high Russian standard and the ??nd reproduction is clear. ???

Flaherty did with the Eskimo in his classic production, \\"Nanook of the North.\\" Though the kaleidoscopic flashes give one quite an impressive conception of these people, who live on the banks of the Amur River, there is neither the clarity nor the drama of \\"Nanook\\" in this present offering.Igdenbu is the name of a young hunter who has a good head on his shoulders. He is a born leader and does well by his people. It is claimed by Amkino, the representative company here of the Sovkino, that the storv is real. Igdenbu typifies the Bolshevik and the Soviet emblem flutters in a closing sequence.There are some beautifully photographed stretches in this film, but quite a number of others are spoiled by a vignette of haze. Amo Bek-Nazarov is too eager to show himself a stylist to give as graphic a story as there was in \\"Grass,\\" for instance. He depicts the ceaseless rain, which destroys the tribe's mighty salmon catch, on which they depend largely for Winter rations, but in doing so he points his camera hither and yon, so that the result is more than a trifle confusing.The Goldi in this film get down to eating the dried skin of the fish. Finally, however, the heroic Igdenbu literally brings home the bacon, with flour and other food, much of which the tribe had apparently never had the faintest idea of eating.Through the enterprising Igdenbu the tribe in one episode awakens to the absurdity of putting faith in magicians and idols made of wood.Li-Iun-Shen undertakes the rôle of Igdenbu and he gives a believable performance. Valentina Ten is wonderfully natural as the girl. The magician or shaman is played by a man in that line of endeavor. Igdenbu's father is acted by a nomad camp hunter.

Mining-law reform seemed a cinch. Since 1872, mining companies have been given almost unlimited rights to extract gold, copper and other minerals from Federal land without paying a royalty the way oil, gas and coal producers do.

These nine male a cappella singers from South Africa, who are at the heart of the new Broadway play \\"The Song of Jacob Zulu,\\" make music so insidiously penetrating that you seem to absorb it with your whole being rather than just the ears. Fond of reverberant harmonies that can skirt doo-wop and gospel, Ladysmith Black Mambazo is not loud in volume or showy in its effects. Rather, this group, best known to American audiences for its \\"Graceland\\" collaborations with Paul Simon, seems to have a ventriloquist's gift for tossing its voices lightly through space. The voices seem to be pitched to aurally subliminal frequencies more suggestive of heaven than of earth.   Because their unaccompanied music rises out of nowhere, the group's first entrance in \\"Jacob Zulu,\\" from a deep well far upstage at the Plymouth Theater, has a theatricality so stunning the rest of the evening is hard pressed to match it (and never does). Simply dressed, the men climb to stage level and then advance toward the audience as if to push their airy music forward. They keep coming and coming, their singing expanding as they walk, and by the time they reach the stage's edge, the whole house is ready to embrace them.

For the basic story about the hazards attendant on the pre-Civil War beginnings of the Pony Express is not exactly new to Hollywood nor is it likely to be a revelation to devotees of the Western. But to give proper credit it should be noted that the producers have not stinted in money, sets, costumes, livestock of cast. And the cast, playing their roles to the hilt, seem to have earned their salaries.William Elliott, a cinema bucka-roo, whose cool talents have dis-posed of more bad men than all the frontier marshals put together, is the hero of this sagebrush saga. As one of the founders of the equine mail service spanning the 2,000 miles between St. Joseph, Mo., and Sacramento, his time was divided between cursorily wooing the local banker's daughter and eliminating dastards. These are led by Joseph Schildkraut, a stage-coach line owner, obviously eager to destroy his new competition, Mr. Schildkraut's suave villainies are more than adequate for this latest test. As the banker and his daughter, Reinhold Schunzel and Vera Ralston contribute exotic accents to the Old Western proceedings, while Gail Patrick, as Schild-kraut's scheming cohorts, handle the other principal assignments. In short, \\"The Plainsman and the Lady\\" is a Western which is prettier than most but not much different.

A more thoughtful analysis of the remuneration of teachers would reveal that the starting salaries in the profession are not the real issue, but rather the prospect that a bright, bushy-tailed young professional, whose peers pursue careers in medicine, law, engineering, etc., faces a future with no potential for significant compensation, if the choice is made to remain ''merely a classroom teacher.''
