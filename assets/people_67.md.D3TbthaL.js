Ten years ago, the playwright Len Jenkin wrote a new adaptation, which was presented at the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis. Now, for her parting production as artistic director of the CSC Theater, Carey Perloff is offering the New York premiere of the Jenkin version. The production is co-directed by Ms. Perloff and her CSC successor, David Esbjornson.

Set in a quarantined English port during a cholera epidemic in 1831, this well-researched novel uses the crisscrossing experiences of a 15-year-old prostitute, a surgeon and a journalist to explore the underside of 19th-century medicine and the Industrial Revolution. Earlier this year in the Book Review, Annette Kobak praised the author's ''outstandingly generous and fertile imagination'' and her ''limber and vivid'' prose.    LIVES OF THE POETS, by Michael Schmidt. (Vintage, $20.) A British publisher and editor conducts a sweeping (and lengthy) tour of English poetry from the mid-14th century to the present, issuing breezy, opinionated assessments of everyone who crosses his path. '' 'Lives of the Poets' is . . . almost constantly interesting,'' Henry Taylor wrote here in 1999. It is ''the work of a man who has read widely and lovingly, and now wants also to be fair and inclusive, without giving up his independence of taste.''    BLUE PASTORAL, by Gilbert Sorrentino. (Dalkey Archive, $12.95.) In this satirical, picaresque novel, a composer embarks with his wife and child on a quest across America in search of the notes that will form the ''Perfect Musical Phrase.'' The result is ''a wild and crazy book, lavishly inventive, full of surprises, sometimes exasperating, often exhilarating,'' Joel Conarroe said in these pages in 1983.    NAT KING COLE, by Daniel Mark Epstein. (Northeastern University, $17.95.) This vigorously written biography captures the graceful American balladeer in all the phases of his short life (he died at 44 of lung cancer), from teenage prodigy to dazzling jazz and pop music icon in the 1940's and 50's. The book ''gives us the most complete accounting yet of all the Coles who added up to a musical king,'' Margo Jefferson wrote here in 1999. It was ''a career that was astonishing for its cultural timeliness and good fortune.''    FLU: The Story of the Great Influenza Pandemic of 1918 and the Search for the Virus That Caused It, by Gina Kolata. (Touchstone/Simon & Schuster, $14.) A science reporter for The New York Times traces the efforts of modern researchers to discover why the flu plague of 1918 (it killed tens of millions of people) was so virulent, and to keep it from happening again. ''As well as its intrinsic excitement, Kolata's narrative offers a number of insights into the workings of science,'' David Papineau said here last year.    WHAT THE BODY REMEMBERS, by Shauna Singh Baldwin. (Anchor, $15.) This ambitious novel, which takes place during the era of India's independence and partition, focuses on the relationship between a childless 42-year-old woman and the 16-year-old bride her wealthy husband brings home to bear him a son. ''With her sharp focus on women in . . . turmoil, Baldwin offers us a moving and engaging look at 20th-century India's most troubled years,'' Ron Carlson wrote here in 1999.

Edited by Sonia Orwell and Ian Angus. (David R. Godine, $17.95.) For much of his career, George Orwell was primarily a reporter, reviewer, polemicist and cultural critic. These volumes, originally published in 1968, include both well-known essays and personal correspondence, and much of the work is infused with politics and Orwell's commitment to socialism. ''The result . . . is far superior to all but the very greatest of literary biographies,'' Hilton Kramer wrote here. ''The editors have performed their task with great industry and great tact, and have given us a classic.''    THE FALL OF THE YEAR, by Howard Frank Mosher. (Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $13.) In a fictional northern Vermont town, a Roman Catholic priest with a colorful past tries to keep the peace among the eccentric residents. His adopted son is the novel's narrator, and ''each exchange between the two is a small story in itself, in dialogue so right you feel like you're eavesdropping on a small, special world,'' Kimberly B. Marlowe said here in 1999.    THE END OF IDEOLOGY: On the Exhaustion of Political Ideas in the Fifties, by Daniel Bell. (Harvard University, $19.95.) Originally published in 1960, this collection of essays focuses on the protean nature of American society and the decay of Marxism and other systematic ideologies in the West.

The differences in approach between the three sets provide an interesting insight on how the impact of performers can be affected by the manipulations of the people who are guiding their careers - or, in these cases, their recording careers.   By 1954, Miss Vaughan had gone through 10 years of a gradually unfolding career - as a band singer with Earl Hines and Billy Eckstine's bands, then into a solo career recording for Continental, Musicraft and Columbia. Complete collections of recordings by jazz musicians can have substance and value because, no matter what the basic material, the performance is the creation of the musician. Like most singers, however, Miss Vaughan was expected to be aimed at a pop market, given current plug songs and novelties, and squeezed into trends of the moment.

These volumes, published in 1963 and 1966 respectively, are the standard work in English on Sikhism as a religion and the Sikhs as a people seeking a degree of autonomy within India - an issue manifested in the recent assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. Khushwant Singh's use of Persian, Gurmukhi and English sources for ''The History of the Sikhs'' is one of its virtues. Volume One provides a detailed political and military history of an area plagued by Hindu-Moslem antipathies and by the Sikhs' desire for separation. Volume Two has been cited by reviewers as a corrective to pro-Hindu or pro-Moslem historical writing.       MY LAST SIGH, by Luis Bunuel. (Vintage, $6.95.) From 1928 to 1977 Luis Bunuel, the Spanish avant-garde film maker, directed 32 films, including ''Los Olvidados,'' ''Viridiana,'' ''Belle de Jour'' and ''The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie.'' Peter Schjeldahl wrote in The Book Review that ''My Last Sigh,'' published shortly after Bunuel died in 1983, ''may be quite simply the loveliest testament ever left by a film director.

The organization hopes to continue housing programs that formerly depended on government financing with help that will come largely from volunteers.   One of the most urgent problems in the Bay Shore-Brentwood community is that of home foreclosures since empty houses invite vandalism and threaten neighborhood stability.
