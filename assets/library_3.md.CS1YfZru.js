As a result, she has become one of the most important documentary photographers working today, taking her place alongside such contemporaries as Sebastiao Salgado, Eugene Richards, Susan Meiselas and a handful of others. A marvelous exhibition of Ms. Mark's work opens today at the International Center of Photography Midtown. It was organized by Mary Ann Fulton of the International Museum of Photography at George Eastman House in Rochester.   Like many other photographers, Ms. Mark achieved her first success depicting people from other cultures. In her case, a Fulbright grant in 1965 enabled her to spend two years photographing in Turkey and throughout Europe.

Although not widely known in the United States, Mr. Fabro, who is 56 years old, is a prominent member of Arte Povera, the Italian art movement that formed in Milan and Rome in the late 1960's, becoming known for its stylish iconoclasm and unusual materials.   The initial impression created by Mr. Fabro's 25-year retrospective is that he has never had an artistic idea he didn't like.
