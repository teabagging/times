The Resort at Squaw Creek, which opened Dec. 20, seeks to change that with its 405 rooms and suites, which have been added to the 60 rooms and 300 condominium units that previously existed at the base of the mountain.   The new resort is about a half-mile from the main base lodge. A high-speed triple chairlift takes skiers to the top of Snow King Mountain (formerly Red Dog Peak) at 7,550 feet, from which they can ski to lifts, trails and base facilities.    The Squaw Creek resort consists of two buildings, a nine-story hotel and a shorter structure that varies from one to three stories and contains four restaurants, some retail shops, a fitness center and some conference rooms.   In addition to skiing, Squaw Creek, on Lake Tahoe, offers skating and cross-country skiing in winter, and tennis, horseback riding and an 18-hole golf course, opening next summer.

The forests around the church, now a National Historic Site, and cemetery have given way to industry, and the only reminders of the village green -the setting of events that helped establish a foundation for the First Amendment freedoms of speech, religion, press and assembly - are a small parcel of land and the remnants of an old stone wall.\\n\\n''One of our dreams here has been to get our stone walls back in shape,'' said Connie M. Cullen, administrator of Saint Paul's National Historic Site and Bill of Rights Museum. ''This place was not taken care of for a long time - the parish did not have the money - so it was neglected and people would take stones until the whole wall was dissipated.'' Standing beside the small portion of wall that survives, she said the original wall was built ''to hold up and support the village green,'' which once extended about a mile in front of the church. With the acquisition of adjacent property, donated by the city of Mount Vernon to be used for a driveway and parking lot, Ms. Cullen said a restored wall would serve as ''a natural separation between the modern driveway and the beauty of the historic site.''

After their beautiful moment on Mr. Carminati's yacht, the handsome and cynical bachelor steals out of the damsel's life forever. If you have seen more than ten films in your life, you will not have to be told that the participants spend the next forty-five minutes languishing in polite despair for the partner of that wonderful night. While Mr. Carminati is refusing to be consoled by champagne and his retinue of ex-mistresses, Miss Harvey is striving to quench the ardent memory by agreeing to wed a reliable young man who, though she does not know it, is Mr. Carminati's brother. When her perfect mate turns up for the wedding feast, you can perhaps imagine the orgy of sacrifice and renunciation that transpires.If it is not unkind to say so, the new film at the Roxy is a musical comedy libretto without the musical comedy. Its chief liability is a grim and rather frightening absence of humor, which places the plot in the embarrassing position of having to speak for itself. Although Miss Harvey and Mr. Carminati are abundantly equipped for romantic comedy, the script requires them to be liquid-eyed and love-sick at distressing length. Luis Alberni, in what is technically known as the comedy relief, is supposed to raise the roof with merriment during his colloquies with a parrot which mutters \\"Horseface!\\" when he appears in the vicinity. All in all, \\"Let's Live Tonight\\" is something the world will little note nor long remember. . . .

Born in Providence, Rhode Island in 1942, Stephen earned his doctorate at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in solid state physics and material science engineering. He resided with his family in Pacific Palisades, California for 32 years. Stephen was deeply loved and respected by his family, friends and business associates as a warm-hearted, honest and incredibly generous individual. He will always be remembered for his intelligent wit, offbeat sense of humor and an endless spirit and passion for life. Stephen A. Koffler was a Managing Director at Barrington Associates and formerly a Managing Director with both Smith Barney and Merrill Lynch & Co. He also launched his own firm Koffler & Co., which was eventually acquired by Barrington Associates. ''Steve was a valuable partner and a dedicated family man,'' said Jim Freedman, Managing Director of Barrington Associates. ''His guidance and presence at our Firm will be greatly missed.'' After a successful career on Wall Street, Mr. Koffler joined Mattel, Inc. as a senior financial executive, and went on to run the west coast operations of several firms, including Smith Barney, Merrill Lynch & Co, and Sutro & Co. He was well known as one of the leading investment bankers in the country, pivotal in highprofile deals including the sale of Jenny Craig to Deutsche Bank in 2002, Midas Rex to Medtronics, and Avia to Reebok, as well as many others. Mr. Koffler served on the Board of many organizations including Saint John's Health Center Foundation, the Greater Los Angeles Zoo Association, Sandel Medical Industries, and the Los Angeles Music Center Opera.
