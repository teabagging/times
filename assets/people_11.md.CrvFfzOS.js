And while her commitment to the visual world and faith in easel painting may not seem to have much to say to the brave new art world of the 1980's, younger artists are, in fact, very much aware of her achievement.   One reason why Freilicher generates such loyalty and good will is that her work is without malice, pettiness and the need for judgment. Another is that she paints from the inside out. She begins not with a theory or program but rather with a mood or feeling.

Irving served twice as President of the Board of Directors of Congregation Beth Simchat Torah, New York City's Gay and Lesbian Synagogue. Founding President of New York City's Gay and Lesbian Community Services Center. First openly gay member of the Board of Governors of the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College.

My heart is broken. Your Lou    COOPERBERG - Irving. The Board, Staff and Volunteers of the Lesbian and Gay Community Services Center mourn the passing of our Founding President and dear friend and colleague, Irving Cooperberg. Irving had the foresight, determination, humor, and tenacity required to guide the Lesbian and Gay Community Services Center through its early years. His generosity and determination played a key role in securing the building which is now the Center's home. Irving led the Center's first critical fund raising campaign, spurring other members of our community to follow his generous lead. Upon completion of his term as President (May 1987), Irving was named President Emeritus by the Center's Board of Director in 1988. Together with Lou Rittmaster, his lover of 25 years, Irving continued his fundraising efforts for the Center. Irving's wisdom and generous spirit were present in his devotion to New York's gay and lesbian synagogue, Congregation Beth Simchat Torah, where he served as Chairman for five of his fifteen years as a member of the Board. His smile and laughter overcame even the darkest hours, and he faced his twelve year struggle with HIV and AIDS with a courage none of us will forget. Through his example we learned about living and not dying with HIV. He was, simply put, a true Mensch. Our deepest sympathy and love go to his devoted lover, Lou Rittmaster. Everyone at the Center will miss Irving more than words can say, and we are forever indebted to him for sharing a vision and spirit that lights our path to a brighter tomorrow for future generations of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. Judith E. Turkel, Esq President Richard D. Burns, Esq Executive Director Michael Seltzer Board Co-Chair Janet Weinberg Board Co-Chair Lesbian & Gay Community Services Center    COOPERBERG-Irving. Congregation Beth Simchat Torah, NYC's gay and lesbian Synagogue, mourns the loss of Irving Cooperberg, one of the g'dolei hador-the giants of our time. Irving was a visionary and an inspiration. Irving gave to community without limit. One of the earliest members of the shul, he served as a trustee for 15 years, and as Chair of the Board for 6. His soul was bound up with community. We are diminished without him. We pray that Lou and the family will find comfort in the many living monuments left by Irving which honor his memory. May they be comforted among all the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Rabbi Sharon Kleinbaum Yolanda Potasinski, President Congregation Beth Simchat Torah    COOPERBERG-Irving.

The Board of Governors of The Reconstructionist Rabbinical College (RRC) express their sorrow on the death of Irving Cooperberg. He was a deeply committed Jew and effective communal leader whose work contributed substantially to the betterment of the Jewish community. His concern for the future led him to serve on the RRC Board of Governors, where he served as a bridge to the gay and lesbian community.    COOPERBERG-Irving. Our Irving is gone. Metaphors spring to mind: a mighty oak has fallen; a bold pioneer has left us. We admired and respected him, but above all we loved him (and indulged him) as a friend and colleague and brother.

It is a collection of eleven one and two-reel British war shorts—films representative of the hundreds which have been made for and distributed by the Ministry of Information during the last three years and which have done much to inform and encourage the British people in their war effort. \\"Inside Britain\\" is the collective title which the playhouse has given to the films. And, although they were made individually to serve a particular nation in critical times, the lot of them should be of vital interest to American audiences, not only as significant samples of morale films but, in certain instances, as vivid and compelling accomplishments in the documentary field.These are not films which can be classed with the run of entertainment shorts, but obviously their ability to hold attention is the measure of their worth. Some of them are mainly informative, some inspirational and some a combination of both. (Three have been shown over here before on programs at the Museum of Modern Art.) Yet all have a vital quality which derives from their subjects and purpose, and a few would be stimulating pictures under any circumstances.Most striking in this last respect is probably \\"Shunter Black's Night Off,\\" which gives a dramatic report on an incident in a railway yard, when a workman heroically separated a carload of explosives from a blazing car of wheat. It is a terse, tense and inspiring episode. \\"Ferry Pilot\\" is also an instructive and exciting account of the work done by the Air Transport Auxiliaries, which ferry planes from factories to bases for the R. A. F., and it contains some beautiful aerial photography and shots of a Spitfire going through tests. And \\"Commandos\\" is a gripping newsreel sequence reporting the raid on Vaagso and Maaloy in Norway.\\"Neighbors Under Fire\\" is a factual glimpse into the lives of the East Londoners after the first terrific air raids in 1940, while \\"Troopship\\" recounts, for the benefit of the people back home, the routine of a soldier's life aboard same. \\"Scotland Speaks\\" is a pretty-picture survey of the war potentials in that corner of the British Isles, and \\"Young Veterans\\" is an interesting demonstration of the fighting tactics now being learned by British troops. \\"The Builders\\" is an inspirational discourse on the service of construction workers, and \\"Yesterday Is Over Your Shoulder\\" humorously relates how any man can do his bit.The program is concluded with a lengthy and rather tedious colloquy between Leslie Howard and three empire soldiers—a Canadian, an Australian and a New Zealander—on the things for which they are fighting and the unconquerable spirit of man.

The monkeys were donated by the Riverbanks Zoo in South Carolina to enlighten New Yorkers about this endangered species. The best time to see BeBe and Peg is in the morning, when they're full of vim and vigor. After lunch (crickets, worms, fruit and vegetables), the pair tend to get window shy and it becomes difficult to make their acquaintance. Their home is behind a large glass exhibition in the zoo's Tropic Zone. Their native habitat is in Brazil's southeastern coastal rain forest (these two, however, have always been in captivity), where this tamarins species is in peril. Less than 1,000 are believed to exist worldwide","excerpt":"an international consortium of conservation groups has been working to save the remaining population. What makes them so special? They move like sparrows, have disproportionately long, delicate nails, fashionably coiffed orange manes and eyes that seem to bear the weight of the world. The zoo is open daily from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. Mondays through Fridays, 11 A.M. to 5:30 P.M. on weekends and holidays. Starting in November and through March, the zoo is open from 10 A.M. to 4:30 P.M. daily. Strollers are welcome and a cafeteria is on the premises. Admission: $2.50 for adults, 50 cents for children 3 to 12. Greenburgh Nature Center   Dromore Road, off Central Avenue  Greenburgh, N.Y.  (914) 723-3470  All ages    The 32.5-acre Greenburgh Nature Center is fond of boasting about its \\"animal museum,\\" home to 126 animals, according to a recent census. Most of the menagerie is inside the center's 1918 manor home, a rustic stone-and-shingle house. This is virtually an indoor petting zoo, though the animal collection is indeed eclectic: no ponies here. In two former bedrooms on the second floor (there is no elevator and visitors are asked to leave strollers downstairs), you can hold, stroke, even wrap around your neck in some cases, snakes, a ferret (who also likes to kiss), rats, mice, a chinchilla and turtles, among others. There is also an African hedgehog, Yashka, whose back feels like a Brillo pad. Yashka is old, having suffered a stroke and lost the use of her hind legs. Squiggy, the snapping turtle, is not meant to be touched, unlike most of the other animals, and that goes for the baby timber rattlesnake and copperhead, both of which were found in Westchester County. The iguanas are, of course, enigmatic, but the Burmese python is larger than one would expect. On the grounds outside are a pet cemetery, chickens, rabbits, turkeys, hawks and a great horned owl whose brown eyes blink and mouth clicks when greeted. The glass and wire cages indoors are arranged at a child's-eye level; most of the animals are meant to be touched and they all have names. But that can be superfluous. As a 4-year-old said, pointing to one resident: \\"It's a wattlesnake.\\" The nature center is also ideal for a long walk along the bosky trails and for birthday parties in the house's sunny party room. Restrooms and a water fountain are on the first floor. The museum is open Mondays through Thursdays from 9:30 A.M. to noon and 1 to 4:30 P.M. and on Saturdays and Sundays from 10 A.M. to 4 P.M. Suggested contributions are $2 for adults and $1 for children. 'To Preserve Tibetan Culture'  'Monks Demonstrate a Modern Craft'   American Museum of Natural History  Central Park West at 79th Street  (212) 769-5800  Recommended ages: 3 and up  Through Nov. 8    Four Tibetan monks, sitting cross-legged on raised platforms, are diligently fashioning dolls to raise funds for the growing Buddhist monks' migration from Tibet into India. Families can see the dolls being created -- from the carving and painting of the clay and paper heads to the sewing and beading of their elaborate silk brocade costumes -- every day except Monday, Columbus Day, from 10:30 A.M. to 5 P.M., through Nov. 8. The monks, from the Drepung Loseling monastery, formerly in Tibet but now in India, are paid a small stipend for their work. They are here to tell New Yorkers about their plight after the Chinese takeover. In addition to observing the monks busily working, four display cases of finished Losel dolls can be seen. The \\"Picnic Scene\\" display, for example, shows noblemen and noblewomen relishing their picnic, a valued pastime in Tibet that can last up to 10 days. The noble characters sit resplendent in costume and poise; their faces, like all the other dolls', are sensual, serene and unflappable, including the nurse's, who is busy taking care of the noble baby. The noblemen even sport one earring, just like the women. And the Lhasa apso in this picnic scene reminds viewers that these tiny dogss hail from a high plateau on the cusp of the Himalayas. The suggested admission fee to the museum is $5 for adults and $2.50 for children. The museum is open from 10 A.M. to 5:45 P.M. Sundays through Thursdays and until 8:45 P.M. on Fridays and Saturdays. Information on purchasing the dolls, which cost about $500, can be obtained through the museum gift shop. 'Wild Lives'   Leo Castelli Gallery  420 West Broadway (near Spring Street)  SoHo  (212) 431-5160  Recommended ages: 3 and up  Through tomorrow    Over two years, the artist Dianne Blell photographed Africa's vanishing wildlife, trekking alone or with African rangers and native trackers through the bush, savannahs and deserts of Kenya, Namibia, Mali, Rwanda, Tanzania and Zimbabwe. The photographs she took of such endangered species as the elephant, mountain gorilla, rhinoceros and African painted wolf can be seen in this exhibition. The color photographs are huge; many are close-up shots, allowing young viewers to see, for example, just how wrinkled an elephant's skin really is. A detailed photograph of a female gorilla shows her caring but frightened eyes; a shot of a bull giraffe's snout reveals its similarities to a camel's. Some youngsters get very excited over the lion pictures: in one, a lioness is devouring a buffalo, while another is sitting pretty after dinner. This photograph may be slightly scary because of the blood, though children seem to accept it matter-of-factly. Another photograph of youths forcing an elephant herd to retreat might stir children to cheer for the Africans, but also to empathize with the animals. The second-floor gallery, reachable by elevator, is open from 10 A.M. to 6 P.M. Tuesdays through Saturdays.

Many of these companies want to provide customers with a broad array of digital services, but to do so they need to pump torrents of bits into homes at high speeds.         The telephone companies, in particular, are scrambling to find new ways to supply their customers with high-speed data connections capable of carrying video and Internet services. But the most often discussed solution, replacing their existing copper phone lines with high-speed optical fibers, is breathtakingly expensive, and the most obvious solution, using existing coaxial  cable, has already been appropriated by the cable television companies that are  now competing with the phone companies.

The measure, containing no restrictions on private lawsuits, faced withering attacks from both cigarette manufacturers and public health authorities.

The main bipartisan bill for a thorough overhaul of the law was never allowed onto the floor for a vote.

California's experience has created a new nationwide industry of policy-making by plebiscite, often dominated by special interests.   A18    Supreme Court to Rule on H.I.V.  The Supreme Court took up its first case under the Americans With Disabilities Act, and the argument over whether the law covers people who have the H.I.V. virus but who show no symptoms of disease underscored the statute's complexities. The 1990 law forbids discrimination against people with disabilities, defined in part as ''a physical or mental impairment'' that substantially limits ''some major life activity.''

The company's current version of \\"The Comedy of Errors\\" at St. Clement's Church is easygoing and broadly eclectic. A motley group of professionals and near professionals has been gathered under the leadership of William Gaskill, the distinguished British director. Only a few of the actors seem to have a feeling for Shakespeare beyond the immediate horseplay.   The company specializes in nontraditional casting and in so doing approximates on stage the broad ethnicity of the people in the audience. In principle, this serves a very useful purpose, but as practiced in \\"Comedy of Errors\\" it leads to unnecessary confusion. The two actors twinned as Antipholus do not look or sound anything like each other, contradicting a crucial point in this comedy of mistaken identity.

At least, this joint production or Edmund L. Dorfman and Laurel Films has an oddly disturbing slow-beat rhythm and plenty of sleazy atmosphere. It also has capable performances by Zachary Scott, Faye Emerson, Mary Boland, J. Edward Bromberg, Kay Medford and Sam Levene.The story, we'll grant you, is average—and average, in this type of film, means patent, contrived and superficial, which adds up inevitably to dull. It's a densely involved now-you-see-it-and-now-you-don't sort of rigamarole about the desperate hunt for a kidnapped youngster by his father, a rummy ex-cop. And met in the course of the searching are some unpleasant smugglers of gems, a waterfront hotel proprietress, a shady doctor and any number of goons. In short, neither story nor characters are of a lofty or edifying sort.But the slow, sultry, steaming sadism that is usually standard in this type of film is rather effectively accomplished. The photography is full of heavy moods. And some of the melodramatic action, such as a chase in the subway, is good. Mr. Scott plays the agonized pursuer with genuine intensity and Miss Emerson does very nicely as his frightened and earnest ex-wife. Miss Boland, best known as a comedienne, plays a blowsy old harridan colorfully and Miss Medford is properly brittle and trashy as a trull.Mind you, we aren't proclaiming \\"Guilty Bystander\\" much of a film. But for those who want cheap melodrama, it has its considerable points.

Review/Music","excerpt":"An Irish Mix Of Rock Beat And Folk"},{"year":"1928","title":"An excellent all-screen entertainment was presented last night by William Fox before a discriminating gathering in the Globe Theatre. The feature picture, \\"Mother Machree,\\" a sympathetic and skillful blending of gentle humor and restrained sentiment, was prefaced by several splendid Movietone subjects, a conspicuously successful example being that of Beatrice Lillie in selections from the musical comedy, \\"She's My Baby.\\" This effort was singularly captivating, so much so that one, in listening or laughing, almost forgot that it was only Miss Lillie's shadow that was providing the singing and the fun. Gertrude Lawrence's image was seen and heard in one of her old songs, which also met with hearty aproval.The narrative of \\"Mother Machree,\\" which begins in 1899, was written by Rida Johnson Young, who was responsible for the words of the famous song. It may be an old, old story, but it is one with a strong appeal, not only to those who hail from Erin, but to those who are not opposed to a tale of a mother's love. It is beautifully staged and capitally photographed. The flashes of Ballymore, as set up in Hollywood, bring to mind such towns as Tipperary and glimpses of the outskirts of Cork and Limerick. The cast has been adroitly selected. Belle Bennett officiates as Ellen McHugh, the Mother Machree of this film. Victor McLaglen, who gave a striking performance as Captain Flagg in the film conception of \\"What Price Glory,\\" in this instance plays the part of a Kilkenny giant with a woebegone traveling road show. Subsequently he is seen as a side-show performer in America and later as a satisfied, good-natured member of New York's police force. Philippe DeLacy, a good-looking and thoroughly manly little fellow impersonates Brian McHugh as a boy, and Neil Hamilton takes charge of the rôle when Brian grows up.This chronicle hinges on the hard time the devoted Widow McHugh has in making a living. Even in America she finds herself forced to take a job with a carnival. This gives her enough money to send her little son to a good school, but the principal, an austere woman, discovers by chance how the Widow McHugh is earning her livelihood and forthwith sends Brian away from the school. Mrs. McHugh then is confronted with the proposition of permitting the school principal to adopt her son. The mother consents to this because she is so eager not to interfere with Brian's future.In one especially charming scene, Mrs. McHugh, while a scrubwoman in a household, secretly takes charge of a baby girl who is constantly crying. Mrs. McHugh finds that the child has as \\"much clothing as the Queen of England,\\" and she promptly takes off the old-fashioned attire. Soon the infant is wriggling and laughing. It is a distinct surprise to the eminent physicians and the nurse, and the mother appreciates that Mrs. McHugh knows better than any one else in the house how to look after the child. The audience was stirred to laughter when the baby put its little toes on Mrs. McHugh's lips.There is a storm scene on the coast of Ireland that is cleverly pictured. The pathos in this film is shrewdly balanced by nice touches of comedy. There is the great contrast between the unpretentious Ballymore cottage and the palatial New York residence in which Mrs. McHugh finds work.In the end, as one might gather, every one is satisfied, for Mrs. McHugh becomes a despot in Mrs. Cutting's home and Brian McHugh weds the girl who as an infant was supposed to be so ill-tempered.Miss Bennett acts with an earnest, motherly conception of her part. Mr. McLaglen introduces moments of humor and sadness. Pat Somerset has a minor rôle. In one scene Neil Hamilton, as the grown-up Brian, is supposed to sing \\"Mother Machree,\\" the song being heard through the medium of the Movietone, which furnishes the orchestral accompaniment for this production. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"An Irish Mother. Bootleggers and Night Clubs."},{"year":"1994","title":"The Prime Minister of Ireland, Albert Reynolds, made a surprise appearance on Sunday afternoon. He turned up at Carnegie Hall to introduce the Fureys, four brothers who have been making folk-tinged pop hits for two decades. The Prime Minister's appearance -- something like having President Clinton as M.C. for Crosby, Stills and Nash -- was a measure of how important music is to the Irish, who have held on to their traditions as tenaciously as any people on earth. Young musicians still work to become world champions on instruments like the tin whistle and the button accordion, and bands don't consider it old-fashioned to include fiddle or uillean pipes, the bellows-driven Irish bagpipes.   The Fureys' show was part of the annual incursion of top Irish bands. For American fans of Celtic music, it's feast or famine, because every booking agent in the United States seems to get the same bright idea: March tours for Irish bands so every major city can have Irish music on St. Patrick's Day. Over the weekend, I heard Altan at Town Hall on Saturday night, the Fureys on Sunday afternoon and the Pogues at the Beacon Theater on Sunday night. Still to come is the big night itself, Thursday, when the Chieftains play Carnegie Hall and New York's own Black 47 comes to the Academy.

These days the enemies list includes Mayor David N. Dinkins and Irish-born gay men and lesbians.    In fact, Ireland itself and the Irish generally, especially the younger generations, have become noticeably more receptive to change in recent years despite the fretting of an old-guard establishment. A spirited willingness to challenge entrenched cant is evident in everything from the popularity of Mary Robinson as liberal President of the republic to the success of The Irish Voice, a lively, nose-tweaking weekly newspaper in this country.

Since it seems reasonable to assume that all galaxies harbor stars large enough to become black holes once their fuel is spent, then it would be only a matter of time before all galaxies have at least one black hole sucking the life out of them. Indeed, this is exactly what will eventually occur according to the theory reported on your Jan. 16 front page.     Although the universe may be expanding and may continue to do so indefinitely, there is the possibility that it will eventually collapse in on itself. Therefore, what had been the two great conjectures about the end of the universe -- that it will continue to expand forever until the lights go out or that gravity will eventually pull all of the stars and planets back together -- will come true, but only relative to their own situation. That is, the universe will expand globally, but shrink locally. Then, according to the new theory, even the black holes will evaporate into nothing.

There is hardly another French cinema actress with more charm—for the French as well as Americans—than Gaby Morlay, who is featured in the picture and finds a part fitted to her talents.Playing in the big Aubert houses all over Paris, it has good presentation and makes a completely entertaining evening.

No doubt it will soon be showing in Manhattan's \\"advance guard\\" houses, if the \\"advance guard\\" could find itself entertained by such a diverting story.The fall of the Briand Government last month perhaps gave an extra fillip, in the mind of Paris, to \\"Les Nouveau Messieurs,\\" since the story concerns the collapse of a Cabinet and the substitution of an extreme Radical Ministry. At the houses where it is showing now a careful foreword is thrown on the screen, asserting that no characters are drawn from life and even explaining that the interior of the Chamber of Deputies, where some of the drama and much of the comedy of the picture occur, was constructed at the Feyder studios.An Ironical Divertissement.Parisians assuredly are associating the picture with recent political events, though aware, of course, that it was made before they happened. They even point out, in laughing whispers, the true identities of various fictional Deputies who play major or minor rôles in the film. Revelations of favoritism at the Opéra and other governmental improprieties are taken with chuckles, as the foreword urges. The chuckles are undoubtedly as ironical as the picture itself.Suzanne Verrier (Gaby Morlay) is a ballet dancer at the Paris Opera. A Count, who is a Deputy of wealth and power, much taken with her, influences her advancement and at the same time makes a rich and elegant haven for her. Far out of his world—and the world he leads Suzanne into—is the young man, Jacques Gaillas, chief electrician at the big theatre. But Suzanne is not insensible to Gaillac's youth and charm.Her interest in Gaillac rises when she learns that he is secretary of the powerful radical-labor organization called the C. I. T. When she watches him quell a mob of striking taxidrivers and win a rate war she does not hesitate to dance all night in celebration with the young worker, and afterward, when dawn breaks, she even takes a swim in the Seine. But Suzanne, sensibly considering the adventure as mere diversion, departs next day for the Count's country château on a three months' visit before the opera season gets under way for her again. She makes a rendezvous for dinner with Gaillac in November on the night of her return.Meanwhile, political events take place. A considerate Cabinet falls and a Deputy, Morin by name, Trotskyesque in make-up, manners and aims, is called to form a Ministry. At the same time young Gaillac, popular among the Paris workers, becomes a Deputy. When Morin calls at 3 A. M. to invite Gaillac to his Cabinet, Gaillac has been expecting him. But he feigns sleep, and when Morin wakes him listens with well-drawn amazement to the invitation.\\"I'll offer you either the Ministry of Marine or Agriculture,\\" says Morin. The ex-electrician shakes his head. \\"Nothing but Labor,\\" he responds, and gets the appointment.So, when Suzanne, eager to see her lover again, comes in to Paris it is a very different Gaillac she meets—the Minister of Labor, seated at a monstrous rococo desk with a score of humble petitioners waiting in the anteroom.Success and Truth.Here the typical success-story which \\"Les Nouveau Messieurs\\" seems to be fades and reality sets in. The Labor Government doesn't seem to do very well. The Ministers—including young Gaillac—are just as inconsiderate to their constituents as the former Cabinet. Favoritism is just as rife at the Opéra. The conservative forces rally, and Gaillac, called home from opening a new model village for workers, is too late to save the situation, even if he could. The elder Count finds Gaillac slightly in the way in Paris and wangles a diplomatic post abroad for him. And to cap the climax Suzanne, offered the mediocre life of the diplomat—no doubt underpaid—returns to the elegance of the great world and the faded charms of the Count as well.With this story actors and director have done remarkably well. It is brightly told and excellently filmed. The photography is modernistic in tone, but always successfully so. The scenes in the Chamber of Deputies are particularly good, especially the moment when the director of the Opéra, listening to an impassioned speech, falls asleep and finds the Chamber peopled in his dreams with gay ballet dancers, lilting their dainty arabesques on rostrum and benches. Gaby Morlay, rowdy and dainty by turn, serious and merry, has a picture well to her taste and capacities, which are infinite.

As a matter of fact, if such a picture were delivered from Hollywood, it would probably be taken through the backdoor and shunted away from critical eyes.The single joke in this picture is that a husband who has let it be thought that he is dead so that his wife may collect his insurance has to pretend that he is his own brother-in-law and watch his former employer pay ardent suit to his wife. In this embarrassing situation he has to hear himself lightly abused and eventually discover that his wife really loves the other fellow anyhow.Mr. De Sica is so plainly superior to the role that his farcical shows of indignation and bewilderment have a tired, indifferent look, and Miss Miranda's fluttering confusion as his lady is weakly contrived. Gino Cervi is mechanical as the other man. Only Luigi Almiranti as a graveyard keeper is facile and comical in two brief scenes.So much of the film is conversational that anyone, who doesn't understand the Italian dialogue—which, by the way, seems to be devoid of any particular sparkle or wit—will spend more time reading the English subtitles than looking at the actors on the screen. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"An Italian Import"},{"year":"1951","title":"The Little CineMet became the Cinema Verdi yesterday and ushered in a new Italian import called \\"Lieutenant Craig—Missing.\\" While the picture isn't so bad that the house need dig up another label in a hurry, there's little to recommend in this rambling, occasionally picturesque and generally antiseptic thriller. It does have a nice story idea, however, and a neat performance by a young ady named Delia Scala, who should go places.Miss Scala plays a naïve village lass who is whisked away to Naples by her new young husband, secretly a British Intelligence officer, and becomes a helpless, terrified pawn for both sides when the bloke sneaks off after some arm smugglers and doesn't return. Most of the footage is taken up with her frenzied search, aided by a spunky old priest.The two of them streak all over Naples, pursued by both the culprits and British Intelligence, who refuse to confide that the young man is alive, preferring to let Miss Scala blab his disappearance to one and all. There is a Wild West finale in a cave, with the hero slithering in to free the two hostages and wipe out the smugglers.All this has been skimpily written and directed with a lick and a promise by Giacomo Gentilomo, who also huddled on the script. Enrico Viarisio makes a twittering member of the cloth, John Kitzmiller is wasted in the brief role, and Val Du Bois, as the husband, doesn't seem to know if he's coming or going. Miss Scala does, in a picture that adds up to nothing more than second-rate Hitchcock, Italian style. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"An Italian Import"},{"year":"1951","title":"\\"Epic\\" is the descriptive which the literary critics have applied to the Italian novel by Riccardo Bacchelli entitled \\"The Mill on the Po.\\" And epic is certainly the quality that an effort was made to achieve in the Italian film based upon that novel, which came to the World yesterday.In the course of ninety-six minutes, the length to which the film has been cut here, Director Alberto Lattuada has attempted to compress a complex tale of nineteenth-century social unrest in the valley of the Po—a tale of resistance to authority by peasant farmers and small mill-owning under-dogs, of a ferment of socialistic sentiment and of a romance between a man and a girl.Even though the film tells but a fragment of all that is told in the book, it obviously represents an instance in which more has been bitten off than could be chewed. Or, at least, in its present abridged length, it manifests a mangled continuity. For so complicated is its plotting and so manifold are its episodes of turbulent action on the part of individuals and of peoples acting en masse that, while it does have the broad sweep of an epic, it is dramatically undigested and confused.Starting out as the story of a girl whose family runs a tiny mill and her fiancé, whose family are farmers, the drama quickly spreads out to embrace a turgid area of social agitation and vague demands for agrarian reform. And before you know it, the girl and her sweetheart are virtually swamped in the wave of unrest, until they are picked up toward the end as tragic victims of a rebellious action by the brother of the girl.In the turbulent sweep of the drama there are vivid and exciting episodes, such as the burning of a mill and an encounter between striking peasants and soldiers sent to break the strike. And all the way through, the panorama of river country and farms that is spread upon the screen in vast profusion has a beauty that cannot be denied.But even the individual characters that create agitation in this scene lose contour and identity, other than as chips on the wave. Jacques Sernas and Carla del Poggio are handsome as the man and the girl and they stimulate some brief compassion as they wistfully go to their doom. Likewise, Giacomo Giuradei, an actual farmer, does a window-rattling job as the young lady's bull-headed brother who will have nothing to do with reaction or reform, and Mario Besesti and Nino Pavese explode on schedule as a wicked landowner and a socialist organizer, respectively.Within the film's framework, however, they lack direction toward meaningful ends, and the sum consequence of their performance is a busy but meaningless film.

In the most magical scene from the film, which sees the world as a kind of surreal international exposition of quaint notions, the founding genius of a utopian farm community dazzles his flock with a crude demonstration of electric light. Moments later, a group of coal workers, who feel threatened by the display, set fire to the place, which despite its name, New Harmony, perpetuates its own version of the class system.   These and other unusual events are seen through the eyes of two Tuscan cowherds, Lupo (Paolo Hendel) and Edo (Giovanni Guidelli), who are fleeing the law after a botched robbery attempt. In hot pursuit are three Austrian mercenaries and the son of the landowner they tried to rob. It is 1848, the year of several European revolutions. As Lupo and Edo make their way through the gorgeous Italian countryside, they are drawn into one strange scenario after another.

Ms. Gerson, who appeared at Cafe Sine (122 St. Marks Place,) on Friday evening with a four-member band, has received the sort of heady word of mouth that young performers dream of, but that can backfire if it is callously exploited.

By his own account, Mr. Jin, who is 56 years old, became enamored of both Western classical music and Chinese folk music in childhood and began a long march toward a career in composition. But no sooner had he completed studies at the Central Conservatory in Beijing than he was sent to a remote forced-labor settlement because of \\"rightist\\" political leanings.   Finally, in 1979, he was released and allowed to compose. But, Mr. Jin has said, \\"my original foundation had been badly eroded, and I was unfamiliar with the new techniques.\\" He had to retrain himself, and through these varied experiences he evolved a distinctive esthetic, which, in his description, combines Western technique and Chinese tradition with his own feelings and ideas.   The libretto of \\"Savage Land\\" was drawn from a well-known Chinese play, Cau Yu's \\"Wilderness,\\" by Mr. Cau's daughter, Wan Fang. The story, set in northern China in the 1920's but similar in its themes to many an Italian opera plot, undoubtedly carried special resonance for the composer. It centers on Zhou Hu, a young man wrongfully imprisoned for eight years, who escapes and wreaks vengeance on the family of the evil landlord responsible for his arrest and the destruction of his family, only to destroy himself in the process.   Mr. Jin's vivid score quotes more or less directly from Stravinsky, Ravel and Prokofiev. But the overriding sensibility is Puccinian, manifest in arias of arching lyricism.   Such a wholehearted adoption and eclectic mix of dated Western gestures by an Easterner might have been considered naive two decades ago. But remarkably, Mr. Jin's tortuous career path has landed him squarely in the current American mainstream, dominated by New Romanticism. And he wields these varied styles and weds them to one another and to his native idiom with wondrous skill and subtlety. Still, for a listener who has serious misgivings about the New Romanticism to begin with, this opera proves doubly disconcerting in some respects.   One of the notable achievements of the modern age has been the international dissemination of the products of the world's great civilizations, but with it has come a homogenizing tendency that now threatens the existence of certain cultural strains. Though Mr. Jin should not be made to bear undue responsibility, the very success of his cross-cultural enterprise further suggests a future in which the most salient features of all cultures are blended at the expense of the refinements of each. This suggestion is only enhanced by the extent to which Mr. Jin's long-breathed, soaring melodies obliterate the quicksilver pitch inflections of Chinese speech, so ingeniously mirrored in traditional Chinese opera.   The production is sung in Chinese, with English supertitles, and the six-member cast consists entirely of young Chinese singers trained in Western vocal style. Sun You, who created the role of Zhou Hu in Beijing in 1987, acted and sang the part here with appropriate bluster, but also managed moments of tenderness, scaling his baritone down to an affecting thread of half-voice. Ye Ying sang the role of his beloved, Jin Zi, with agility and clarity","excerpt":"an occasional hard edge to her soprano, rather than contradicting the vulnerability of her characterization, suggested an underlying strength.   But the most impressive performance of the evening was Jianyi Zhang's as Da Xing, the weak-willed son of the landlord. Though Mr. Zhang's forceful tenor, with ringing high notes and excellent evenness throughout its range, perhaps gave his character too much grandeur, in strictly vocal terms it was a joy. Completing the fine cast were Yun Deng, as the landlord's blind widow, and Yuxin Li and Haojiang Tian, in lesser roles.   The conductor was Paulette Haupt, who was primarily responsible for bringing Mr. Jin's opera to this country. Having heard a rehearsal of the work in 1987 in China, she presented it a year later in piano readings at the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center in Waterford, Conn., of which she is artistic director.   Though it was good to see the company's orchestra back in the pit after a protracted lockout earlier in the season, string ensemble was scrappy, and attacks, both instrumental and vocal, were often tentative.

Having the foresight to follow the major trend of the development of the upper portion of Westchester County, New York in the late 1950s into the 60s, Mr. Cahill, in 1963, founded Cahill Paving Corporation originally in Katonah, New York, soon after moving his company to Bedford Hills, New York where it remained for many years. Seeing the value of an asphalt plant in northern Westchester and Putnam Counties he started Putnam Asphalt Corporation in Patterson, New York as well as Harlem Valley Materials, Inc in Wassaic, New York, all doing business throughout Westchester, Putnam and Dutchess Counties. He continued to successfully run his businesses until his retirement in 1990. Mr. Cahill served for 15 years as a Trustee for the Pension Fund of the Local 137 Operating Engineers Union.

It appeared before the footlights as a comedy, but comes to the screen as a farce. In the original effort Ernest Truex and Vivienne Osborne led the cast. Occasionally one perceives a slight Truex influence in some of Mr. Barthelmess's antics. This photoplay is rather a thin affair, but in the Mark Strand yesterday afternoon it caused quite a good deal on female laughter.Mr. Barthelmess and Mary Hay are an engaging couple, but it is doubtful whether either is suited to this type of narrative. Certainly it is a relief to witness a little merriment on Mr. Barthelmess's countenance, but with his meticulous attempts to extract an insensible humor from different situations, one does wish that for the nonce he were more like Mr. Truex. Mr. Barthelmess makes heavy weather out of ??? traying comedy. There are many changes of expression where subtle and fewer ones would be intensely more effective. John S. Robertson, who has some splendid productions to his credit, is not in his element when directing light comedy or a farce. The subtitle show an energetic but somewhat unsuccessful attempt to be funny.It is a boisterous narrative of married life after the second year. Most of the fun is conjured up from the appearance of Will Webb's old sweetheart, Natalie Woods, who strikes one as being exceptionally tactless and exceedingly demontrative in the circumstances. It means nothing much to her that Will is married and is the father of a child—a new toy. On her arrival Will, to avoid seeing her, goes on his knees pretending to look for the cat. A neighbor in the room explains that the Webbs have no cat. So finally Will has to confront Natalie, and it ends in his impulsive wife deciding to take on a stage part offered to her by Tom Lawrence (Clifton Webb). The rôle is none other than Queen Elizabeth, whose features were quite unlike the nice little Mrs. Webb.Most of the laughter was caused when Natalie, as Elizabeth, appears with a false nose slightly damaged by an affectionate onslaught from Lawrence. Nobody tells her that her nose is twisted and she goes on the stage in the part, and is generally voted to be frightful as an actress. Her husband alone believes in her.Francis Conlon was decidedly effective as the neighbor, Sam Clark. He is a cool customer who dislikes dining alone. His wife is away and therefore he arranges to partake of the Webbs' frugal repast. The Webbs apparently have little money, as they have only four plates of a kind, but the rooms in which they live are spacious. Possibly they got a bargain when they rented the place, but ordinarily one would think that they must pay at least $5,000 a year for the \\"little\\" home.Footfalls are heard rather late in this picture, and so are the door bells. \\"New Toys\\" is only mildly diverting, but it is healthy and wholesome.

Some persons might be quite bored by its frantic efforts to be frightening, but it is only just to state that in the far reaches of the theatre yesterday afternoon the synthetic excitement appeared to be contagious.This yarn is now called \\"The Bat Whispers.\\" It was directed by Roland West, who was responsible for that worthy talking picture known as \\"Alibi.\\" And in \\"The Bat Whispers\\" there is Chester Morris, who stepped a great many rungs up the ladder of film fame through his work in Mr. West's previous production. Mr. Morris, however, does not run away with this screen offering, for the palm for acting is easily won by Grayce Hampton, who gives an extraordinarily facile interpretation of the determined Mrs. Cornelia Van Gorder, who is not going to be bluffed out of a house she has rented by any phantoms.It is all hectic nonsense, sometimes stale and at other times moderately effective. Two or three persons fall down an airshaft and are saved from shattered limbs or death by a pile of laundry. The mysterious chamber discovered through the pressing of a button has its place in the scheme of things. Then there is the money in the satchel, the mysterious disappearance of a banker, the troubled young bank teller, the courageous girl, the stupid Lizzie Allen—stupid though she is, she is really responsible for the capture of the murdering villain.Mr. West takes one through a house on his camera.

Maude Eburne officiates as the noisy and nervous Lizzie Allen.

Half a dozen lives are blotted out in less time than it takes to write about it, and those who have used their pistols efficiently either smile, continue the story they were telling or go on with the crap game. In those days the players opened their eyes and twisted their mouths. Miss Dean herself is rather given to snarling.

He also has a nasty-looking knife to be used when cartridges give out or when he has lost his pistol.The jewels, when poured out into a handkerchief, do not seem as if they were worth all the trouble taken, and through Mr. Browning's cunning Miss Dean escapes the penalty of the law. High judicial powers are invested in a Police Captain who is able to promise immunity to the culprits if they return the loot.\\"Outside the Law\\" is entertaining in much the same way as \\"Nellie the Beautiful Cloak Model.\\" You are more amused than grieved at the many mortal coils that are severed.

For any artist of a certain age, or indeed for anyone at all, the contemplation of mortality cannot help but be chilling.

Yet Blake Edwards has had the temerity to begin at least two films, the laceratingly funny ''S.O.B.'' and now the more temperate, reflective ''That's Life!,'' with the thought of death. Mr. Edwards is more often thought of as a comic director than as one with a cutting edge, but there have been times, like this one, when he has had the candor to confront an audience with things it may not want to face. Any film that deals, as ''That's Life!'' does, with a man's worries about death, illness, impotence, artistic failure and compromise must be appreciated, at the very least, as fearless.

John Gay's hugely successful and forever influential ballad opera is the antimatter of all that was noble on London's musical stage in 1728. Yet for Gay and his literary colleagues, Alexander Pope and Jonathan Swift, it was more. What seems to us cheerful theatrical nihilism meant for them bold revision of a prevailing balance of trade, one in which simpler domestic ingredients would emerge from beneath the weight of foreign importation.   Englishness at the time was under siege from all sides, with a foreign King from Hanover, with a German composer named Handel at the head of London's music and with Italian opera seria everywhere. \\"The Beggar's Opera,\\" played here at the Santa Fe Opera on Thursday night, thoroughly demolished them all.

But at her recital debut on Monday afternoon at the Kaye Playhouse, Ms. Plette explored the ways in which a powerful voice and a taste for grand gesture could be put to the service of intimate expressivity. She posed some interesting challenges for herself in songs by Poulenc, Griffes and Richard Strauss that rely, to varying degrees, on currents of delicacy and nostalgia.    Had she merely scaled back her sound, she would have seemed restrained, not persuasive. Instead, she followed her instincts and shaped each song on her own terms. She found the perfect lilt for Poulenc's \\"Chemins de l'Amour,\\" and in Griffes's \\"Three Poems by Fiona McLeod\\" she suggested the hazy, impressionistic atmosphere without making any sacrifices in power. The Strauss songs were better still: her graceful changes in coloration were entirely responsive to the texts, and made for exquisite, moving accounts of \\"Befreit\\" and \\"Morgen.\\" Review/Recital","excerpt":"An Opera-House Voice In the Service of Intimacy"},{"year":"1971","title":"Al Carmines is the kind of artist who joins rather than merges.

Perhaps it has gained by the delay in dignity and a certain dispassionate quality. In spite of its ardent patriotism, there is nothing in it designed to inflame bellicose feeling on either side of the Rhine. If the authors have refrained from concluding their series of fighting episodes with a picture of the signing of the Armistice, it is surely because the scene could hardly have been done without representing triumph on one side and humiliation on the other. The film is not a propagandist history of the war. It is the story of the bravery and suffering of a French family during the great ordeal.It is a pathetic story. The Duchène family, rooted in the soil, lives in the village of Plessis. An ordinary family","excerpt":"an ordinary village, with the chateau of the Baron de Montmaure on the outskirts. Charles Duchène and his wife are well advanced in middle age. One son, Max, a student at the military school of St. Cyr, is at home on holiday, and spending a good deal of time at the chateau in the company of the charming Claire de Montmaure, daughter of the house. Roger Duchène, another son, is still a stripling. One shade darkens the peaceful family life: Paul, the eldest boy, having committed some youthful fault, has left his parents long ago and nobody knows what has become of him. We are shown the Duchène homestead in its simple surroundings. Into this tranquillity in the Summer of 1914 is thrust the terrible disturbance of the war.Their Self-Sacrifice.Max is at once at the front, where we see him fulfilling the proud vow of the St. Cyriens and marching into battle wearing the plume, the white gloves and the conspicuous uniform of his school. Somewhere in North Africa the exiled Paul, without communicating with his family, enlists in the Foreign Legion under a false name. He also is quickly at the front, is wounded and sent to hospital. As chance would have it, he is nursed by Claire de Montmaure, and the two fall in love with each other. Returning to the trenches, Paul, at great risk, rescues a wounded officer from \\"no man's land.\\" The officer, believing he is going to die, hands him a letter to be delivered. There, in the dugout, Paul makes the double discovery that the man he has saved is his brother Max and that the letter, a declaration of love, is addressed to Claire. Paul immediately writes to Claire, resigning all claim on her affection, as he has discovered that she is loved by another more worthy.Max dies in hospital in the presence of his mother. Under this cruel blow the Duchènes, each in his own way, rise to the purest height of self-sacrifice. Both the father and the young Roger go off to the trenches, leaving the mother to her pathetic share of solitary suffering. The flood of war sweeps into the neighborhood of Plessis, which is occupied by the enemy. A German staff takes up its quarters in the chateau, where Claire and her mother remain because the girl is too ill to be moved. Paul, whose battalion has been brought to this part of the front, volunteers for a dangerous duty behind the German lines. Entering the chateau, he is able to prevent German mines from being fired and the French attack, thus facilitated, forces the enemy to evacuate the village. For his brave feat Paul receives the Croix de Guerre and the Mèdaille Militaire, and it is during the ceremony of investiture that the great recognition takes place and he is welcomed back into the stricken family. It is left to be understood that he is to be betrothed to Claire, whose feeling toward Max had never gone beyond youthful friendship.That is the essence of the film. M. Jacques Haik, who presents it, is to be congratulated on having made it, above all, a picture of people overwhelmed by an undeserved fate. The enemy shown to us is not a particular nation, but war itself. Even the best of M. Joe Hamman's battle scenes—charges at Verdun, the taxis of the Marne, the pathetic \\"trench of bayonets\\"—are less moving than the human story. M. Hamman has not emphasized the brutal side of the carnage, and there is comic relief provided by Bicard and Gaspard, two Parisian characters who have already appeared in popular fiction, and who are helped by a lively American chauffeur. Of the acting, that of M. Desjardins of the Comédic Française in the part of the father is admirable, almost mystical in its rendering of the religion of French patriotism. Mme. Jalabert, as the mother, is unequal in quality, but her best is very good and the producers must be held responsible for certain weaknesses in the part. The Claire of Mlle. Michèle Verly is disappointing. M. Jean Murat's Paul is well conceived and energetic.Another War Film.It is perhaps unfortunate that the one other film of real distinction recently produced should also be a war piece; any impression that the French cinema is tending in a military direction would be mistaken. In any case, \\"L'Equipage\\" was well worth producing because it is a strong story with a genuine idea in it. The \\"équipage\\" is the crew of a military airplane; that is to say, the pilot and his observer. The point of the novel of M. J. Kessel, on which the film is based, is that these two men, associated in a most perilous task and isolated from the rest of the world, are morally fused into a rare and single-minded comradeship. This strong bond is forged between the young Herbillon and the middle-aged Maury, the one impulsive and enthusiastic and the other reserved and melancholic. It is easy to imagine the shock with which Herbillon discovers that his mistress in Paris is Maury's wife. The comradeship is strained, and as soon as Maury in his turn finds out the truth it becomes intolerable. When the order is given for the squadron to seek combat with the enemy, Maury, to the genuine but unexpressed satisfaction of Herbillon, plunges madly into the thick of the conflict, hoping to find death. He fails. It is Herbillon who is killed, while Maury goes back to his wife, to be received at last with a new tenderness born of the moral ordeal through which the woman, too, has passed. M. Georges Charlia, who plays Max Duchène in \\"La Grande Epreuve,\\" is much more effective in the part of Herbillon, which offers better opportunities. It is worth noting that the air fighting is interesting, not only because it is presented with technical skill, but because it forms an intimate part of the story. There is a clean, masculine savor about the whole picture of life in an aviation camp, and a good deal of the credit for this is due to the acting of Pierre de Guingand as Captain Thélis, the commander of the squadron.F. W. Murnau's next picture for Fox will be \\"Our Daily Bread,\\" preparation on which he starts soon. It is an adaptation of the play \\"The Mud Turtle,\\" in which the director will incorporate some of his own ideas. Mary Duncan will probably play the lead. Mr. Murnau has just completed his second Fox production, \\"The Four Devils.\\"\\"Grease Paint,\\" an original story by Svend Gade which Universal has purchased as a photoplay for Conrad Veidt, will be released under the title of \\"The Play Goes On.\\" FRANCE'S WAR FILM; Their Self-Sacrifice.

Kurt Luedtke, Newspaperman Turned Screenwriter, Dies at 80"},{"year":"1929","title":"\\"Married in Hollywood,\\" an audible pictorial adaptation of Oscar Straus's tuneful operetta, with, additional music by Dave Stamper and I Arthur Kay, has the distinction of being the first screen translation of a superior type of musical composition that has not been presented in this country. This offering\\", which is now holding forth at the Roxy, is an especially fine example of vocal recording, and, although the story is no weightier than one is accustomed to in such musical affairs, it is adroitly interspersed with joviality and extremely clever photographic embellishments.The principal songs are charmingly rendered by Norma Terris, the Magnolia of Mr. Ziegfeld's \\"Show Boat,\\" and J. Harold Murray, leading man of that popular stage contribution, \\"Rio Rita.\\" The musical numbers were supervised by Edward Royce and the picture itself was directed by Marcel Silver.Mr. Silver has accomplished his work with skill and imagination. He has succeeded in accounting for leaps from one place to another and for lapses of time so intelligently that all is as clear as crystal, without an explanatory stretch of dialogue or a subtitle. He keeps a check rein on his comedy, with the consequence that the fun is never spoiled by a too generous dose of one idea. True, his conception of the happiness of two lovers by showing them cavorting under trees in the Springtime is not conspicuously original, but before that sequence reaches the screen Mr. Silver has already captured the hearts of the audience by his Barriesgue depiction of Mary Lou's (Miss Terris) dream.Mary Lou is first seen retiring for the night. She has had a heated argument in the theatre with Prince Nicholai, the heir-apparent to the unstable throne of one of those fictional kingdoms of the Balkans. Soon after Mary Lou sets her alarm clock the scene dissolves into one of her slumbering thoughts, with Mary Lou sitting with the Prince at dinner, which, instead of being a tète-a-tète affair, the idea of which had caused the squabble between the two, is an elaborate banquet. The Prince, at dinner, wears his coronet, and he gives to Mary Lou another sparkling coronet, which, he says, he knows will fit her, as he had it specially made her size. She places the emblem of royalty on her head, and as she leans forward it comes dangerously near to toppling off, but she adjusts it in time. After a while Mary Lou and her Prince, still wearing their coronets, glide gracefully over the waxed floor.The evening is a marvelous success! The tinkling of gentle bells is heard, and then the scene fades from the dream to reality and there is a clock with the none too musical sound of its alarm.Another nice stretch is that in which Mary Lou sings at a ship's concert on her way to her native land and a counter part is heard coming from the nebulous figure of the Prince.At the outset Mr. Silver takes his audience from scenes of an orchestra to those on a theatre stage, where Mary Lou is the successful substitute for the prima donna. In later views of this playhouse Mary Lou is late. Why? Because she is away in the country with her Prince. The Queen is annoyed, and she perhaps has reason for being royally mad when the orchestra plays the national anthem three or four times, just because the stellar performer has not put in an appearance.The last episodes of this production are in natural colors. They deal with Hollywood, to which centre Mary Lou has flown after a tempting offer from a motion picture producer who happens to be aboard the vessel when she sings at the ship's concert. This amusing producer is capitally played by Walter Catlett.Some of the more subdued but none the less effective levity is furnished by Lennox Pawle, who has the minor rôle of the King in this his first talking film. Mr. Pawle for the short time he is on the screen makes seconds count. One might say that he gets under this King's skin. The troubles of the Balkan State are grave to Mr. Pawle, and his serious mien, quite naturally, aroused mirth from the unsympathetic spectators yesterday afternoon.Miss Terris's spoken scenes are not to be compared with those in which she sings. Her acting here is nothing over which to wax enthusiastic, but her singing is quite another matter.The same criticism applies to Mr. Murray, for while he has an ingratiating personality, his talking and acting are not likely to stir one's imagination.The stage settings of this production and the costumes of the actors are in keeping with the calibre of the music. There is a sense of restraint, of commendable conservatism, which is most pleasing after the sharpness and noise of jazz and the hardness of modernistic furnishings.

As mystery-suspense novels go, Dick Francis' tend to be rather slight on both counts.

The somewhat preposterous plot involves equine mutilation, a social-climbing pet food magnate and the bloodthirsty British press, and serves mostly as a backdrop for Sid's psychological anguish -- caused by the discovery that his longtime racing rival, the glamorous Ellis Quint, is a villain. Sid is, after all, the guardian of an England most of us think has long since passed into nostalgia","excerpt":"an overachieving child of the slums, he is dedicated to serving his social betters and keeping the class structure safe. Thus, if his instincts tell him the well-bred Quint is guilty, he believes those instincts must be called into question. Sid, of course, lives up to his cumbersome nickname, Tungsten Carbide (the strongest abrasive known to man), persevering despite the public outcry in favor of Quint, the threatened loss of his remaining hand and a sappy subplot involving a young girl with leukemia.

One is tempted to write off the results as proof that idle econometricians are the Devil's helpers. But the findings from Daniel Hamermesh of the University of Texas and Jeff Biddle of Michigan State are complemented by other research showing that obese women are also at a considerable earnings disadvantage. And they could figure prominently in the very serious business of deciding who is protected by the three-year-old Americans With Disabilities Act.

A moving welcome mat that zips you to your room? Or maybe a levitating front desk? If so, the low-tech but stylish lobby will be a letdown. The hotel-of-the-future is actually behind the scenes. In what may be an industry first, the entire hotel runs on a Net-based platform that controls everything from the concierge's wireless headset to the water pressure in your room. But the James Bond award goes to that infrared sensor, which scans the room for body heat so that housekeepers don't accidently walk in on guests. Knocking is so last-century.    THE LOCATION -- A short walk from Pike Place Market and the Belltown night-life district, the 120-room hotel occupies the lower 14 floors of a new residential tower in downtown Seattle. A well-heeled crowd spills out of the hotel's popular restaurant, BOKA Kitchen + Bar, neutralizing the effect of the seedy pawn and pornography shops next door.    THE ROOMS -- After check-in, the front desk clerk escorted us to our room, No. 1406, to show off the gadgets: a smart minibar that tells housekeeping when you're out of beer","excerpt":"an ultrahigh-speed Internet connection; and, most impressively, a 40-inch L.C.D. screen that does quadruple duty as a 5.1 virtual surround-sound theater, computer screen, satellite radio and digital art gallery. There's also a nifty touch-screen VoIP phone that schedules wake-up calls, summons your car from the valet, orders breakfast and checks weather and flight status -- all with surprising ease. Yet, despite all the gizmos, the room did not feel like a Circuit City. The décor was sleek and comfortable, with a downy bed, lots of earth tones and dark woods, and a smattering of homey touches like a bedside collection of Thoreau essays and an old-fashioned metal alarm clock. Unfortunately, the clock's battery died that evening.    THE BATHROOMS -- Cavernous and sexy, with dark teal walls, limestone floors and an electronic shade that descends from the ceiling with the flick of a switch so that guests in the bedroom can't see in. There is a deep soaking tub and a separate, marble-walled shower stocked with Molton Brown toiletries. The best part? The bathtub does, indeed, fill from a hole in the ceiling -- and without splashing. Pretty cool.    AMENTITES -- The usual perks (Wi-Fi at no extra charge, a full-service spa and a compact gym) plus plenty of unexpected amenities (virtual-reality golf, a rooftop dog run and no charge for domestic calls). A cozy lounge next to the lobby serves breakfast in the morning and cocktails at night and a fourth-floor library has a fireplace, cushy reading chairs and a seductive book collection -- a perfect hideout during Seattle's rainy days.    ROOM SERVICE -- Available 24 hours, including a Wagyu beef burger ($14) and Northwest King salmon with beluga lentils ($29). There's also a children's menu. Breakfast (three microscopic blueberry muffins, yogurt with fruit and granola and a glass of orange juice) came to $16 and was delivered as promised at 9 a.m. I called a few minutes later for honey; it was delivered--teleported? -- almost instantaneously.    THE BOTTOM LINE -- A wired-to-the-gills hotel for geeks and nongeeks alike. Published rates start at $400, but rooms booked through the hotel's Web site can start as low as $275.

The concern of the public and some medical institutions about AIDS has been raised greatly by the Centers for Disease Control report on possible transmission of the AIDS virus from a dentist to a patient.    Even before the C.D.C. report, people in and out of the medical community were proposing that those infected with HIV not be allowed to care for patients. Many nurses, technicians and doctors have been removed from their duties when their employers found out they were infected with HIV. In addition, some employers are requesting the HIV status of workers perceived as members of \\"risk groups,\\" alleging that such information is needed to determine whether the employee is fit to work.   It is crucial to base policy recommendations for the prevention of HIV infections in hospitals on scientific fact and not reaction to public fears and misconceptions. Recent reports in the medical press have noted the absence of infection among patients of HIV-infected surgeons.    Many health-care workers are reluctant to treat AIDS patients, particularly if surgery or invasive procedures are involved. If the C.D.C. report leads to restricting the practice of HIV-infected individuals, the HIV-negative worker may refuse to treat HIV-positive patients.    The reason is that if the worker suffers an accident and becomes infected, he or she may be punished by removal from patient care, by stigma and unemployment.   Policy recommendations for the prevention of HIV infection in hospitals must protect patients and health-care workers, without discriminating against either.

That nugget of information comes from a newly uncovered trove of data in the bank's records, shedding new light on the first mass migration to America -- the flood of refugees from Ireland's devastating potato famine in the middle years of the 19th century.

Sports of The Times","excerpt":"An Unheeded Warning The Arrival of Spring A Sour Estimate Big Brother"},{"year":"1925","title":"Tod Browning, who produced \\"The Unholy Three,\\" has another original and stirring production at the Capitol this week. It does not quite come up to his previous picture, but it has one or two matchless scenes played with all the seriousness due them, but which nevertheless are bound to evoke laughter. Mr. Browning has a distinctive bent for this special type of crook story, which has a circus for a background, or, as in this instance for a brief period, a carnival.This new offering is introduced under the title of \\"The Mystic,\\" and there is no doubt that it keeps one fairly enthralled during its showing. Conway Tearle and Aileen Pringle are excellent in their particular rôles, and while there are a few weaknesses in this picture they are only important in weighing the probability of the story. As in \\"The Unholy Three\\" the law strikes one as being extremely docile and lenient with these crooks, but this feature does not make the production any the less interesting.The most brilliant idea in this photoplay is where Mr. Browning, who incidentally not only directed this effort but also furnished the narrative, has a fake clairvoyant declare that she actually sees a ghost. This startles, Jimmie Burton, the guiding spirit in the crooks' schemes, as only a minute before he had been informed by the innocent young ward of a man named Bradshaw that she had beheld the ghost of her father.This photodrama is worked out along the same lines as \\"The Unholy Three,\\" as in the first chapter we have the gypsy clairvoyant, Zara, played by Miss Pringle, doing her stunt before a little throng at a carnival in a small town. It is Burton who has vision. He sees the possibilities of making a fortune if Zarzarack, the manager, and Anton, the expert knife-thrower, will listen to him. Burton maps out the plot and the others are beguiled into following him, with the result that it is not long before Zara is telling fortunes in a mansion, that is fixed up with electric wires and an organ which when touched gives the necessary signals to Anton.They have a place in the baseboard through which in the darkness, Anton, arrayed in mystic white enters the room and, with striking tint soft lights thrown on him, he looks like a real spectre. As the story is unfurled this ghost tells Bradshaw that he has been misusing the funds belonging to his ward, Doris Merrick, and as it is true, the old gentleman is naturally alarmed.There are scenes in which the detectives are studying the methods of the crooks, and the Inspector of Police, who like the others had been told to hold hands, is depicted tricking the fakers. Doris, however, is so credulous, after having heard about her guardian's wrongdoing, that she decides to entrust all her money and jewels to the care of Burton and his colleagues. Eventually there is a quarrel between the three men, because Burton has a change of heart and wishes to return the money and the valuables.Miss Pringle has given telling performances in several pictures in which she has appeared, but she has never been seen to the same advantage as in this production. She looks and lives the part. She is positively beautiful in her display of anger, savage but quiet. Her gowns were designed by Erte, the French symbolic artist. In several scenes Miss Pringle wears a long black velvet gown trimmed around the neck with white fur. It is a startling creation and one which enhances the swarthy beauty of Miss Pringle, as seen in this production.Mr. Tearle, the popular screen hero, develops a strong character in Burton. It is the best work he has done for the screen for a couple of years. He is restrained and he no longer betrays his old habit of lifting one eyebrow. In this film he distinguishes himself by giving a sound and sympathetic performance which is always easy and natural. Mitchell Lewis and Robert Ober are also effective in the respective rôles of Zazarack and Anton.This is a fascinating story and one in which Mr. Browning never strikes an unpleasant note. He has an original and dramatic method of unfolding a narrative and while there are gripping situations they are offset by natural comedy which as a relief is only humorous to the spectators and not to any one character.

When Mr. Gordon was 14 years old he went on stage at a Memphis talent show, egged on by a pair of friends who wanted the $5 fee to buy a bottle of wine. ''I did this tune called 'Please Throw This Old Dog a Bone,' '' Mr. Gordon recalled the other day, ''and right in the middle of my show, somebody threw a great big old bone right up on the bandstand.''

To be sure, they all flourished in roughly the same period, the 1920's and 30's, and they share what might be called a period style that resulted, in part, from the efforts both groups made to adapt the effects of Cubist painting to the medium of photography.\\n\\nThis style is characterized by a fondness for straight lines and simple curves as well as for unusual viewpoints that give familiar subjects an unfamiliar, often ''abstract'' look. The Americans as well as the Europeans aim for the kind of striking ''Cubistic'' effects that Constructivists introduced into the graphic arts, and they all concentrated on angular, hard-edged subjects such as buildings and machines that would enable them to achieve such effects.\\n\\nHowever, in spite of such similarities, it is odd to see these Americans and Europeans joined together under the exhibition title ''Constructivism and Photography'' as they are at the Prakapas Gallery, 19 East 71st Street, through Saturday. Constructivism was a European phenomenon that had little if any influence on American photography, and despite a shared respect for Cubism, European Constructivists had a very different attitude toward photography as a medium than the American modernists. The interesting thing about the current exhibition is the way it brings out this difference.

Baba Is Named Best Dog"},{"year":"1929","title":"John Barrymore, whose films are few and far between, is to be seen at the Rivoli in the first production in which his performance has been guided by Ernst Lubitsch. It is a silent pictorial tragedy of a Swiss mountain village, and it relies a great deal on the idea that the events are supposed to occur in 1812, when the French were at the throats of the Austrians. Although it is capably acted and intelligently directed, with excellent scenic effects and settings, the story is not especially moving, which appears to be partly due to the sketchiness of the script.This offering, known as \\"Eternal Love,\\" is based on a novel by Jacob Christopher Heer. Mr. Barrymore is supported by that personable German actress, Camilla Horn, and his rival for her affection is played by Victor Varconi.Mr. Barrymore is given to extravagant grimaces in expressing both anguish and love. As Marcus Paltram he is referred to as a daredevil, but aside from one or two scenes in the mountains, notably those in which he meets death with the girl he loves, this handsome individual bows in a seemingly humble fashion to the customs of his people. And so far as the folk of the community are concerned, they fail to take into consideration the character of the girl, Pia, who declares she was betrayed by Marcus. One would imagine that the sensible clergyman, the Rev. Tass, would himself have endeavored to do something to set matters right, for not only does Pia behave outrageously in trying to win Marcus from Ciglia (Miss Horn), but she is spurred on in her plotting by her wicked-looking mother.Marcus falls from grace on the night of a masked dance. He becomes intoxicated and has a tiff with Ciglia. Pia takes advantage of the squabble and through her machinations Marcus finds himself forced to wed her. His rival, Lorenz Gruber, not long afterward makes Ciglia his bride.Ciglia's thoughts are constantly devoted to Marcus and it is not long after the two weddings that Lorenz discovers this. He offers Marcus a bag of gold to leave the village, but Marcus spurns the money and then one night Lorenz decides to risk a shot at Marcus. This is the beginning of the tragedy in which three lives are snuffed out and the evil Pia is left to repent at leisure.Mr. Lubitsch gives an idea of the contrasting homes of Marcus and Lorenz. Marcus and Pia snap and snarl as they cat with their fingers. Ciglia and Lorenz have a comfortable home, Ciglia being resigned to life with her husband. It occurs to one here that judging by Marcus's table manners, it would have been a difficult task to train him to be compatible to Ciglia.The village dwellers have no time for reasoning. They decide impulsively and are eager to deliver judgment. The tale might have been more convincing if the Rev. Tass had been able to restrain his parishioners, if only for a short time.During those moments when he portrays Marcus's inebriated state, Mr. Barrymore is excellent. He, however, has a tendency to be too melodramatic most of the time. Miss Horn is charmingly sympathetic, despite a touch too much of mascaro on her eyes. Mr. Varconi's work is uneven and he fails to depict the mood expected.Mona Rico does well as the designing Pia. Her mother is played by Evelyn Selbic, whose actions cause one to wonder why the village residents permitted her to remain in the community.But Mr. Lubitsch's Alpine scenes are realistic. He makes the most of the snow and gives a reasonably impressive conception of an avalanche during the closing stretches. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"An Unusual Drama.

Mr. Jansons trained at the Leningrad Conservatory and in Vienna, but the most powerful stylistic influence seemed to be that of Herbert von Karajan, with whom he studied in Salzburg, winning the Karajan Competition in 1971. Even some of Mr. Jansons' EMI recordings have hints of Karajan's control and detached comprehension.   Mr. Jansons, who has been music director of the Oslo Philharmonic since 1979, has received relatively little critical attention, given his abilities. So when he led his orchestra on Saturday night at Carnegie Hall, my interest was high.

One major danger is that the deficits are beginning to feed on themselves as the rising burden of financing the debt drives interest rates higher, which in turn causes deficits to grow faster.    Alice Rivlin, who has returned to the Brookings Institution from her post as founding director of the Congressional Budget Office, said that unless recent budget decisions were changed, they would lead to ''high and rising structural deficits that almost no one defends as desirable fiscal policy, a rapidly escalating burden of debt service and a mix of fiscal and monetary policies that is reducing United States competitiveness in international markets and seems likely to retard growth.''        Two economists of the Congressional Budget Office, Kathy A. Ruffing and Paul N. Van de Water, estimated that if nominal interest rates remained at their October 1983 levels, the cost of Federal interest payments would rise by a total of $142 billion in the 1984-89 period.

However, these days the ANA is offering education in a much more personal form through classroomtype seminars - and plans are in the works for significant expansion of that program.\\n\\nThe seminar program got under way in 1969, when the ANA conducted a series of classes on numismatic subjects in Colorado Springs, on the campus of Colorado College where the national organization has its headquarters. Since then, summer seminars have been held each year at that location, and in each of the last two years there have been companion seminars on college campuses elsewhere. This year, for example, sessions were held at Penn State University and the University of Wisconsin at Stevens Point.\\n\\nNow the association is seeking to broaden the base of this program, with the aim of making it available not only throughout the country but also throughout the year. Next summer, it is expected that at least one seminar, and possibly several, will be held on the West Coast. In addition, ANA officials hope to institute smaller but similar sessions in conjunction with regional coin shows.

JAMES JOYCE'S IRELAND (Yale University, $30) illustrates how the novelist turned cultural and historical bric-a-brac into art.

Mr. Pierce, a senior lecturer in English and related literature at the University College of Ripon and York St. John in York, England, also includes paintings and drawings inspired by Joyce's works (including Joyce's own caricature of Leopold Bloom), photographs of present-day Ireland by Dan Harper, a superb bibliography, a chronology of Joyce's life and times, and thumbnail sketches of important figures in Joyce's life.

Yesterday, they hit a 52-week low of 101 1/8, before closing at 102 1/2, up 1/2.   The success of Teledyne, founded in 1960, is credited to one man, Henry E. Singleton, its chairman and chief executive officer. He has steered Teledyne to steadily higher earnings by acquiring part or all of scores of companies along the conglomerate route.
