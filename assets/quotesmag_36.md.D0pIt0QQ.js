Compared with this finished production, \\"Der Kampf\\" and other anti-Nazi films brought here from the Soviet Union seem crude and ineffective.This grim screen portrayal of the alleged outrages committed by a detachment of the Red Army upon a peaceful little German settlement during the early days of the Bolshevist revolution is intended to epitomize the hardships suffered by some of the German villages along the Volga under the Soviet régime, and to magnify them to the nth degree. Released all over Germany about a year ago, \\"Friesennot\\" no doubt is doing yeoman work in building up hatred and contempt for the country regarded by Adolf Hitler as his greatest enemy. Its propaganda value in New York, where cinema audiences are rather skeptical about films painted all black and all white, is likely to be trifling.Briefly, the story tells how a remote village peopled by descendants of Germans from Friesland who had sought religious freedom in Russia centuries ago is \\"discovered\\" by a Soviet aviator and visited by a commissar and a troop of cavalry, who proceed to requisition food and livestock and force their attentions upon the women. In the beginning Juergen Wagner, the middle-aged spiritual and political leader of the community, accepts the new order as coming from God, like all authority, good and bad. The younger men protest, but are held in check by Wagner until the death of a girl and the profanation of the church finally break down his Christian pacifism and he takes the lead in wiping out the invaders, who are surprised during their drunken orgies in the house of worship. Then the village is given to the flames, and the surviving settlers gather together their few possessions and start on a long trek toward the Persian border.Among the outstanding actors are Friedrich Kayssler, as Wagner","excerpt":"V. Inkizhinof, a Mongolian Russian who was the hero in Pudovkin's \\"Storm Over Asia,\\" but who seems to have turned against the Soviet, as the commissar, and Hermann Schonberg in the rôle of the viril leader of the younger peasants. Jessie Vihrog is excellent as a German girl, with a Russian mother, who yields to the commissar and is driven away to the swamps by her own people.The parts of the Red Army troopers are taken by actors probably belonging to the big Berlin colony of anti-Soviet émigrés.

They also have a chance to witness a \\"glorification\\" of the machine, in the shape of a steam-driven crane. There is some first-rate acting by N.

Polyakof, as the worker who becomes an \\"Americanized\\" crane operator.This picture, which graphically depicts the industrialization of the Russian proletariat and no doubt is of great educational and propaganda value at home, is well photographed and directed and the sound reproduction is good. Unfortunately, however, the speeding-up process by which the Russian \\"shock brigade\\" finally overtakes and surpasses the record set by the gang headed by the American specialist is indicated mainly by diagrams instead of by actual scenes. A mild romance between a rather attractive girl interpreter and the Russian instructing engineer does not interfere with the main action. There is more humor in \\"Men and Jobs\\" than is usual in Soviet productions. As the American engineer speaks English throughout and there are plenty of captions in that language, no knowledge of Russian is needed for enjoyment of the picture.MUSIC NOTES.Sir Hamilton Harty, conductor of the London Symphony Orchestra and the Halle Orchestra of Manchester, England, is expected to arrive today on the Mauretania.

As a result, when we were asked to show the articles we were exporting and for which we were filing claims for V.A.T. refunds, we were only able to show them a few items that we happened to carry in our hand luggage.   We had checked in, early enough, specifically to allow for the V.A.T. procedure, and had been told in no uncertain terms that we were not allowed to take our luggage to the V.A.T. counter. And so the procedure to obtain V.A.T. refunds for those items that were in our checked luggage became much more cumbersome.

The memorandums charge that the security firm, Custer Battles, repeatedly billed occupation authorities for nonexistent services or at grossly inflated prices.   A1    France's antiterrorist police identified a young French man killed fighting the United States in Iraq, the first confirmed case of what is believed to be a growing stream of Muslims heading from Europe to fight what they regard as a new holy war.   A1    A British-Iraqi aid worker held hostage by militants made a tearful televised plea, begging the people of Britain and Prime Minister Tony Blair to save her life by withdrawing troops from Iraq. The worker, Margaret Hassan, is the director of CARE International in Iraq.   A8    A military judge rejected efforts by two soldiers charged in the Abu Ghraib scandal to obtain testimony from military intelligence officers about whether the soldiers were ordered or encouraged to take part in abuse of detainees. The judge ordered the soldiers to stand trial in Baghdad early next year.   A8    Plan for Incentives Toward Iran  Britain, France and Germany are working to give Iran a last chance to avoid confrontation with the West over its nuclear program by offering incentives to curtail its most sensitive activities. The Iranian government has given no indication that it will accept the plan.   A9    Search for Chechen Insurgents  The senior law enforcement official in Chechnya said the authorities had nearly captured Aslan Maskhadov, a leader of the Chechen resistance, and that Mr. Maskhadov was planning to surrender soon. The Kremlin has made the capture of insurgent leaders a priority in its effort to quell the Chechen guerrilla war.

A1    Bush and Kerry on the Trail  President Bush said Americans had to judge who would keep them safer from terrorism, portraying Senator John Kerry as dangerously naïve and so weak on national security that his election would all but invite attacks on the United States.   A13    Senator John Kerry, hoping that women's economic anxieties trump their fears of terrorism, vowed to fight for equal pay and minimum-wage increase, more money for education and health coverage for minors.   A13    Courting Conservationists  Each campaign is courting the conservationist vote in swing states like Wisconsin and Nevada, mainly among outdoorsmen, though the word ''environment'' came up just once in the three presidential debates.

A15    Plight of Part-Time Soldiers  Thousands of soldiers in the National Guard and Reserves who were injured on duty are navigating a system suited to full-time soldiers.

A18    NEW YORK/REGIONB1-5    Report Points to Dangers At Highway Checkpoints  The National Transportation Safety Board issued a recommendation that the warning signs for an immigration checkpoint at North Hudson, N.Y., gave either too little information for drivers or a dizzying array of directions that could be confusing. The report cited two major crashes near the checkpoint, including a pileup that killed four people.   B1    Victory for a Younger Brother  A judge handed a victory to Zalmen Teitelbaum, the younger of two brothers in a feud over who will succeed their father, the spiritual leader of the Satmar Hasidim, the largest Hasidic sect in Brooklyn.

The import, which was unveiled at the Normandie yesterday, treats a simple theme—man's constant quest for that peaceful Shangri-la of his dreams—with dignity and more than a modicum of good humor.The result, which unfortunately is watered down by what appears to be some fuzzy editing and by a confusion of dubbed dialogue (Italian), English subtitles and a prologue narrated in English, is, nevertheless, a fresh, surprisingly funny and occasionally inventive addition to the film newcomers from abroad.Louis Berlanga, director, who with Juan Bardem (\\"The Lovemakers\\"), is in the vanguard of Spain's filmmakers, has drawn a pleasantly rustic portrait of genuine, simple folk caught up with life and living in an authentic (and unspecified) village perched high on a cliff above a placid Spanish seacoast.A wanderer, who eventually is revealed as a famed atomic scientist seeking sanctuary in this quiet haven from an explosively modern world that is searching for him, has found the peace and companionship he craves among the people of Calabuch. And the happy idyl comes to an end when, in making a rocket for the townspeople that wins a competition, his picture is published and he is \\"discovered.\\"The story, as noted, is basically a thin one, but the director and a cast, headed by Edmund Gwenn, as the aged, gentle and happy scientist","excerpt":"Valentina Cortesa, as the local schoolteacher who yearns for love and an escape from the monotonous existence of Calabuch; Franco Fabrizi, as the light of her life and the expert Jack-of-all-trades; Juan Calvo, as a splenetic police chief, and supporting, unbilled, uninhibited village types have injected natural fun into a variety of incidents that continuously crop up along the way.The performances, to be specific about it, are not startling. But Señor Berlanga's cast appears to have had a gay, old time making the picture.Although it sputters and falters on occasion, this \\"Rocket From Calabuch\\" does manage to sparkle more often than not.

He is a successful Los Angeles architect and she is a talented sculptor. They have three small sons who are reasonably normal and a circle of married friends who seem to be as happy as they are. When, two by two, their friends start splitting up and seeking divorces, the Thomsons are at first saddened, then worried and, finally, panicked.One day when Jeff returns early to their redwood-paneled, fully applianced house, he finds Mari on the verge of hysteria. She reports that their favorite fruit market is about to be torn down to make way for a service station. She has developed an extremely late case of acne and Donald and Reggie, the happy homosexuals down the block, are separating. That's the last straw. \\"Everything seems disposable,\\" Mari says, weeping. \\"I feel that we must be the last married couple in America.\\"Gilbert Cates's \\"The Last Married Couple in America,\\" written by John Herman Shaner, belongs to that genre of popular comedy that examines faddish contemporary behavior to discover that traditional ways are still the best. Comedies of this sort, which include everything from \\"Father Knows Best\\" to \\"La Cage aux Folles,\\" are more often reassuring than funny. They tend to pull their punches. Almost from the beginning of \\"The Last Married Couple in America\\" we are aware that Jeff and Mari have to fight, split, taste the bleak pleasures of the so-called sexual revolution and then find some decent — and, we hope, amusing — way to get back together, as did Cary Grant and Irene Dunne in Leo McCarey's \\"The Awful Truth.\\"\\"The Last Married Couple in America,\\" which opens today at the Rivoli and other theaters, owes less to Leo McCarey than it does to Paul Mazursky. Mr. Shaner's screenplay has the predictable rhythm of a television sitcom, with vast patches of predictable material between the occasional funny spots.Mr. Cates (\\"I Never Sang for My Father,\\" \\"Summer Wishes, Winter Dreams\\") has no great gift for comedy, but he does have a gift for the right casting. All of the actors bring a great deal of class to their roles, large and small. Mr. Segal is no surprise as a first-rate comedian, but Miss Wood is. She not only looks terrific, she's extremely funny when she's not required to supply emotional bridges left out of the screenplay. Supporting Mr. Segal and Miss Wood with a wide variety of comic resources are Richard Benjamin, as Jeff's best friend, a sort of gloomy Angel of Divorce","excerpt":"Valerie Harper, as a predatory divorcée who succeeds in starting a venereal disease epidemic in Beverly Hills; Dom DeLuise, as a plumber who moonlights as an actor in porn films, and Bob Dishy as what might be termed an ambulance-chasing divorce lawyer. He's always the first person to arrive at the house after the husband's departure.Some of the other good people are Arlene Golonka, Allan Arbus, Marilyn Sokol, Charlene Ryan (who's particularly funny as Mr. DeLuise's hooker-wife), and Mark Lonow and Sondra Currie, who play a wildly dopey couple from San Diego who've added new meaning to their marriage by husband-and-wife swapping.At its best, \\"The Last Married Couple in America\\" is updated \\"Bob and Carol and Ted and Alice\\" and, like the earlier film, it's cravenly faint-hearted. I simply do not believe, as this movie seems to think, that most married men who leave their wives after 10 years of marriage go immediately impotent.

Balderston's play, \\"Berkeley Square,\\" which slipped into the Gaiety last night. And, fortunately, all those who saw him on the stage of the Lyceum will recognize him, for Jesse L. Lasky sensed the wisdom of obtaining the services of Leslie Howard for the rôle.In the matter of poetic charm, nothing quite like it has emerged from Hollywood. It is an example of delicacy and restraint, a picture filled with gentle humor and appealing pathos. It is in a class by itself, which is not surprising, for Mr. Balderston had a hand in transforming the play into screen form and Frank Lloyd, who directed the memorable \\"Cavalcade,\\" officiated in the same capacity for this production.This sensitive and provocative story is admirably suited to a shadow entertainment, and Mr. Lloyd has not missed an opportunity to do justice to camera possibilities. Here there are glimpses of Berkeley Square in the days of yore—1784, to be precise—and also of the same place as it is today. There is the town crier of yesteryear calling out the hour and letting it be known that \\"all's well.\\" The costumes of the men and women have received meticulous attention. One also gleans information concerning the customs 149 years ago. In those days it was not considered quite the thing to take a bath every day. Egad, sir, it becomes a topic of gossip among the persons whom Peter Standish visits on his magic journey into bygone times.Imagine Peter Standish of 1933 becoming so absorbed in a diary of an ancestor of his own name that he cannot think of anything but the glorious days of lace and satin and powdered wigs! When he returns from calling on friends he is discovered at the door of his Berkeley Square residence, and immediately after he reaches the door one beholds the modern Peter Standish suddenly transformed into Peter Standish of the long ago. It is storming outside, and it is therefore no wonder that the gentlefolk of the eighteenth century are somewhat amazed that the new arrival at the party shows no signs of the rain. In fact, his shoes are perfectly dry, which is considered suspicious. Of course, he might have come in a sedan chair, but, even so, in treading the paving stones he would be expected to bear some marks of the weather.It is no wonder that the various men and women eye him askance, for the fellow has a strange way of talking—saying, among other things, that something is \\"all cock-eyed\\"—which, forsooth, nobody else had ever heard before. He knows about occurrences before they happen, and amazes Sir Joshua Reynolds by one particular reference. As for the Duchess of Devonshire, she becomes so indignant at the talk of the immaculate young man that she leaves him in high dudgeon. He is a Yankee who fought under Washington, who lifts his glass to the President of the United States and \\"your King.\\" It is not, however, the fact that he hails from America that angers them. It is his diabolical way of being able to look into the future.Except for excursions which can be taken in photography, the film echoes the play. It leaves you sometimes hungry for more of some scenes, but so did the stage work. There is the tender romance between the Peter Standish of the present time, arrayed in satin and bewigged, and the dainty Helen Pettigrew. Standish knows that Peter of those days married Kate, but he, the modern, is in love with Helen.She is so adorable that Standish cannot keep his secret from her. He tells her he is a Standish of this day and, to give some notion of what he says, the scenes whirl about from age to age, from generation to generation, to wars and peace, until the present.Mr. Howard revels in the rôle. He has done excellent work in other films, but it is doubtful whether he has ever given so impressive and imaginative a performance. He steps from modern attire to the clothes of the eighteenth century without any trace of awkwardness. Heather Angel is attractive and efficient as Helen.

Our luckless seafarers, it appears, are the victims of two rich schemers who want to stop shipbuilding and divert the men to logging for their own, nefarious and profitable purposes. And another ship seemingly lost in the frozen wastes would make their Machiavellian plan all the more secure.There is, of course, a warped romance between one of the villains and the betrothed of one of the marooned sailors. This anguished affair appears to be closer to fiction than fact. But while the six-year travail of the castaways seems to have been overly compressed into a comparatively short period, the rigors of their existence are given colorful coverage.

Those images -- long hair, anti-establishment tirades from the left or the right, and excess in general -- are only vestiges, because rock-and-roll has become so glorified (and potentially lucrative) that no one is shocked any longer by the notion of Johnny leaving home to join a band instead of becoming a lawyer.    So why then would Van Halen sell out the Meadowlands, as it did tonight? One obvious answer is that the band has made music people have liked for more than a decade, and that Eddie Van Halen, the group's guitarist, is a spectacular improviser who can make something out of the genre. But the bigger reason might be that the band members all touch each other a lot, and smile. Though there was plenty of rebellious talk -- the lead singer, Sammy Hagar, gabbed about how neither the past nor the future was important, only living in the present -- it was secondary to the buddy movie the band was playing out.
