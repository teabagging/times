Yeltsin and Russia's Communist-dominated Parliament appeared to break down hours after it was announced. On national television, political leaders resumed their squabbling and appeared to renege on the accord, which was intended to pave the way for confirmation of Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, above, as Prime Minister.   A1    Clinton Administration officials warily monitored the political maneuvering in Russia, disturbed at possible signs of backsliding on Moscow's commitment to tough economic reforms. President Clinton is scheduled to arrive for a summit meeting in Moscow on Tuesday.   A8    Albright Visits Balkans  Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, on a symbolic visit to the Balkans, openly campaigned for candidates in upcoming elections in Bosnia who are considered supporters of the 1995 Dayton peace accords.   A3    Terror Against Kosovo Serbs  Foreign diplomats and human rights workers say that ethnic Albanian rebels have begun a wave of kidnappings and terror intended to drive the small Serbian population of Kosovo out of the province. More than 80 Serbian civilians are missing and feared dead.   A3    Palestinian Executions  A firing squad carried out the first executions under Palestinian self-rule, shooting two brothers convicted of killing two brothers from another family three days ago. Two human-rights groups condemned the executions and called for the abolition of capital punishment by the Palestinian Authority.   A9    Protest March in Cambodia  The opposition marched thousands of people through the Cambodian capital to demand the ouster of the country's leader, Hun Sen. The marchers, estimated in some reports at 15,000, brought the city to a standstill and capped a week-long vigil by opposition supporters who object to Mr. Hun Sen's declared victory in elections a month ago.   A9    Beijing Frees a Dissident  Beijing authorities released a former Tiananmen Square student leader who recently tried to form an opposition party. The police allowed the dissident, Wang Youcai, to return home under house arrest after more than seven weeks in detention. (AP)    Subdued Commemoration  Thousands sought to commemorate the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, on the eve of the first anniversary of her death today. Britain's monarchy, shaken by the public outpouring of grief for Diana, has sought to redefine itself. A photo of Diana was placed near the Paris tunnel where she died in a car crash.   A4    NATIONAL   A10-16    Lewinsky Revelations Sap Confidence of Democrats  Democratic candidates and strategists say there is a growing consensus that the party has all but forfeited its prospect for closing the 11-seat gap and winning back control of the House of Representatives. In the two weeks since President Clinton acknowledged a relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky, the tension and uncertainty within the Democratic Party have intensified as its candidates gear up for the general election.   A1    President Clinton's top legal and political advisers said that they have developed a detailed defense against what they anticipate are the four arguments that Kenneth W. Starr, left, the special prosecutor, might use to mount a case of obstruction of justice against the President.   A14    E.P.A. to Test Household Items  The Environmental Protection Agency is gearing up for one of the most ambitious projects ever proposed to test chemicals found in everyday products for harmful side effects. The work will take place at a laboratory in Uniondale, Long Island.   A14    Strike Leaves a State Isolated  In Grand Forks and elsewhere in North Dakota, nearly everyone depends to some degree on Northwest Airlines, which was shut down by a pilots' strike on Saturday. Residents who survived the flooding last summer are learning to cope with a new problem -- isolation in a state that was served almost exclusively by an airline that is now strikebound.   A1    Setting the stage for what could be a long strike, Northwest Airlines said that it would not alter the dollar value of the final offer it made to its pilots before they walked off the job on Saturday, grounding the carrier's 1,700 daily flights.   A12    Tobacco Ads Face Scrutiny  The Department of Justice is reviewing whether tobacco companies promised some Senate Republicans that they would pay for television advertisements if the Senators voted to defeat the tobacco bill. The advertisements were not to have been direct endorsements of the senators, but were meant to explain the tobacco issue in a way that might provide the senators with ''political cover'' for their vote, according to a complaint filed with the Federal Election Commission by an advocacy group.   A15    NEW YORK/REGION   B1-8    Cabbies See Down Side To a Safety Crackdown  The rules of the road -- and the consequences of violating them -- have changed drastically for cabbies since Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani began his crackdown last spring amid growing concerns about taxi safety. But many drivers and fleet owners, and even some judges in the city taxi commission's own court system, say that some aspects of the enforcement initiative amount to overkill, and are likely to worsen a shortage of full-time drivers.   A1    From Obscurity to Center Stage  Few people outside the Nation of Islam knew much about Khalid Abdul Muhammad in November 1993, when, as the top aide to Louis Farrakhan, he railed so viciously against whites, Jews, Catholics, homosexuals and black civil rights leaders in a lecture at a small New Jersey college that Congress denounced him and Mr. Farrakhan eventually dismissed him from his post. Until a few weeks ago, it seemed he was well on his way back into obscurity. Now, however, fresh from victory over Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani in a Federal courtroom last week, where a judge cleared the way for his Million Youth March in Harlem this Saturday, Mr. Muhammad is about to take center stage.   B1    Hope Amid Synagogue's Ashes  Two days after a roaring fire devastated the historic Central Synagogue on Manhattan's East Side, the senior rabbi of the congregation looked beyond the charred timbers and ruins of a magnificent landmark and saw some reasons for hope.   B5    SPORTSMONDAY   C1-10    ARTS   E1-10    OBITUARIES   A17  Paul J. Anderson  A professor of neurology who directed the Division of Neuropathology at Mount Sinai Hospital and School of Medicine for 30 years, he was 72.   A17    Jerre Mangione  A writer whose thinly veiled memoir of life in a Sicilian enclave in Rochester, ''Mount Allegro,'' became a classic of American ethnic literature, he was 89.   A17    BUSINESS DAY   D1-8  Wall Street Stock Sell-Off Leads to Talk of Recession  The sharp sell-off in stocks has led a growing number of people on Wall Street to wonder whether the stock market, often a leading economic indicator, may be forecasting a recession in the United States. The stock market is down nearly 14 percent in last six weeks, with more than a third of that loss coming in the last week. The stock market has not experienced such a prolonged downturn since 1990, when the nation last slipped into a recession.   A1    New Move Against Microsoft  The Government and 20 states suing the Microsoft Corporation are planning to ask a Federal judge to admit new evidence in their antitrust case against the software maker.

D4    Violating Its Own Standards  Only a handful of the Clinton Administration's sites on the World Wide Web post the privacy guidelines that the Federal Trade Commission recently said businesses should post, and none of the Administration's sites offer the special protections for children that the Government recommends for commercial sites. Even the White House Web site does not meet the standards that were recommended by the Federal Trade Commission and endorsed by the Administration.

Although it's briskly directed and enjoyably stylized, &quot;Out of Time&quot; is shallow —  actually empty. Mr. Washington, as the small-town Florida police chief Matt Lee Whitlock, steals several hundred thousand dollars in seized drug money to pay for the experimental cancer therapy his mistress Ann Merai (Sanaa Lathan) needs. But when she and her jealous husband, Chris (Dean Cain), die in a fire —  and all the money mysteriously disappears, while Matt is left the beneficiary of Ann Merai's million-dollar insurance policy —  the clues point to Matt as the murderer. To make matters worse, Matt's estranged detective wife, Alex (Eva Mendes), is investigating the case. To further crank up Matt's adrenaline level as he's looking for evidence to clear himself, the feds want the drug money —  now. Mr. Washington plays the desperation well; it becomes Matt's defining characteristic. And Carl Franklin keeps &quot;Time&quot; breezy enough to fight the oppressive humidity that his cast is obviously laboring under in the Florida sun by keeping the proceedings buoyant.

It becomes necessary for Sloan to reach New York as quickly as possible and so Mary asks Hiram to take them there in his plane.The three depart, and soon are seen flying over what seems to be Newfoundland, Ireland, France, Germany and the Balkans, finally landing in Russia without ever knowing exactly where they have been. Sloan's fortune, however, is saved and Hastings marries the girl.Patsy Ruth Miller is quite satisfactory as Mary Hastings, and Burr McIntosh, as her father, gives a commendable performance. \\"A HERO FOR A NIGHT.\\"","excerpt":"Transatlantic Air Flight Figures In Picture at the Colony."},{"year":"1934","title":"Attempts suicide CHARLES A.

We gather tonight, witness to events in the Persian Gulf as significant as they are tragic. In the early morning hours of August 2d, following negotiations and promises by Iraq's dictator, Saddam Hussein, not to use force, a powerful Iraqi army invaded its trusting and much weaker neighbor, Kuwait. Within three days, 120,000 Iraqi troops with 850 tanks had poured into Kuwait, and moved south to threaten Saudi Arabia. It was then that I decided to act to check that aggression.

President Gorbachev outlined all the major points of a Soviet initiative developed by himself and the Foreign Minister. President Bush thanked President Gorbachev for his intensive and useful efforts, but raised serious concerns about several points in the plan.    President Bush said the United States will consult with its coalition partners on the proposal. We are in the process of examining the Soviet initiative tonight. The United States and its coalition partners continue to prosecute the war. That is the sum and substance of the situation that we have at this point. QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS    Q. Marlin, did President Gorbachev give any indication that once President Bush gave him these concerns that he was going to take those back to Aziz, and did he leave any hope that there may be some give on the part of Iraqis on those points the President raised?   A. They didn't discuss follow-on procedures. President Bush did say that we would be examining these points tonight, and we will be considering then, how we intend to respond. I would not expect anything -- any response -- tonight, anything before tomorrow. But in terms of what happens then, that really is contingent upon how we view the various points in this plan and what action needs to be taken at that time. Excuse me, Helen? Plan's Drawbacks    Q. What are the concerns that -- what are the chief drawbacks as the Administration would see them?   A. Well, we don't want to go into the individual points. Of course, this plan was just announced by the Soviets a very short time ago.    The telephone conversation lasted approximately 33 minutes, and although they did get a chance to go through the major points, we obviously have a considerable analysis to do. But I would emphasize again that as they went through the various points, President Bush did state the concerns that he felt the coalition would have on this matter, both in terms of points that are in the plan that we have problems with, as well as issues that are not included, so there are a number of issues to resolve. Ground War Timetable    Q. But  [ inaudible ]  hold up the ground war, doesn't it?   A. The ground war is a matter that is still under consideration. The war itself continues. We will continue to seek compliance with the U.N. resolutions, and the President will make decisions concerning the ground war as appropriate. This process that was initiated by the Soviets is continuing at a rather intensive pace, but there is not change at this point in our schedule for prosecution of the war. Aziz-Bush Exchange    Q. During the meeting itself, was Aziz in communication with the President? Was there any two-way on that?   A. No, there was no one else on the phone call and no other communications. Ann? Pullout's Prospects    Q. Does President Bush see now here a chance, for the first time since Aug. 2, to reverse the invasion of Kuwait and actually come about this without launching a ground war?   A. Well, there have been innumerable chances since Aug. 2, in the sense that Saddam Hussein could have pulled out at any time. That still is the fastest and most efficient way to end this war.    In terms of this initiative, it's just too soon to characterize it. We need to take a look at it, but I would say again that we have had our hopes raised before. After serious examination there have been significant problems, and certainly the President has indicated there could well be some difficulties here, but we are taking a look at it. War During Talks    Q. How could he prosecute a ground war if indeed the talks are proceeding in Moscow?   A. Well, that's not an issue at the moment. We are proceeding the war -- the air war continues. There's been no decision on the ground war at this time. And we continue to pursue the matter in the Persian Gulf in the most effective and efficient military way possible. Michael?  Terms of Withdrawal    Q. The President has said all along that the 12 U.N. resolutions are what Saddam Hussein must live up to. In the points that the President raised that he doesn't like, the possibility sounds like that there may be a negotiation under way to drop one or more of those points. Can the President live with anything less than full acceptance of all 12 as long as Iraq pulls out of Kuwait?   A. There is no negotiation under way with regard to the United States. I would remind you again that this is a matter between the Soviet Union and Iraq -- that we are commenting on their proposal, and we are not directly involved in that sense. I would repeat once again, as well, that compliance -- full compliance with the 12 U.N. resolutions -- is the goal we seek, and those are the guideposts that we would use in judging any consideration of withdrawal.    Q. Are you willing to go beyond those 12, though -- to scale back any of those 12?   A. We have said repeatedly that we must have full compliance with the 12 U.N. resolutions. There's no change in that situation. Rita? Soviet Plan's Fate    Q. Marlin, aside from raising serious considerations here, you said that we've had our hopes raised before. In the process of reviewing this, do you at least see that there is some hope here that this peace proposal could work if some of these problems that the President sees are worked out?   A. I just don't want to give it any characterization until we've had a chance to give it the full analysis of the United States Government. Let's take one more question. Charles? Moscow's Role    Q. Marlin, how can you say there are no negotiations going on when Gorbachev tells you his points and you tell them which ones are objectionable, and basically ask him to go back to Tariq Aziz and say -- about these points? Are those not negotiations? Is he not negotiating on your behalf?   A. We haven't asked him to do anything. He's asked our views on these matters. We'll provide them as we have in the last few days, but I reiterate again that this is a matter between the Soviets and Iraq, and we are appreciative that -- of the communication that has told us of these discussions, but we are not a part of the negotiations. Thank you very much.
