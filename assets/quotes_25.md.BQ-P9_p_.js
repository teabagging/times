Here are some tips on bicycle safety from the Bicycle Institute of America, a Washington trade group.\\nBuy a Bike That Fits\\nBicycles that are too big are hard to control. Standing, a child should be able to straddle a bike with about an inch of clearance over the horizontal bar between the seat and handlebars. If the bike has no horizontal bar, use a yardstick to simulate one. Adjust the seat so that with the ball of the foot in the middle of the pedal, the leg is slightly bent when the pedal is all the way down. For maximum control, the handlebars should be more or less even with the seat. \\nWear a Helmet\\nIf all cyclists wore helmets, 85 percent of fatalities and most permanent brain injuries could be prevented. Acceptable helmets carry stickers indicating approval by the Snell Memorial Foundation or the American National Standards Institute. \\nDifferent Rules for Different Ages\\nChildren age 6 and under should ride under adult supervision, even on sidewalks, which also have hazards, like driveway crossings. Children 7 to 8 may ride unsupervised but not in the street. With training, children 9 and older may ride on their own but should avoid busy streets until they show sound judgment.  \\nKnow the Basics\\nChildren ready for street riding should be taught to ride with traffic, to walk a bike to the street before starting out, to differentiate among traffic signals, and to know that left turns can be made more safely by walking the bike across.

Assemblyman Bryant said he wanted to give the message that mothers had to work to support their children. You say, \\"It's worth the risk if it teaches children that work is the order of the day.\\" We can teach these children about the value of work, but first we must value the children.   What do we teach poor children?   * Surely not the value of work. The bulk of the poor in the United States already work -- at minimum wage jobs that give no hope of lifting a family out of poverty. Past welfare-to-work programs have removed more parents from welfare by illegal sanction than by preparing them to work. The pediatrician T. Berry Brazelton (New York Times Magazine, Sept. 9, 1990) concludes that welfare was really designed to punish the poor for failing to be self-sufficient.

The idea is to throw a cantaloupe-sized ball past a goalkeeper into a net during two 30-minute halves. With six players on a side, plus the goalkeeper, the ball is advanced by running with it, dribbling it and passing it among teammates. There is also lots of pushing and shoving, and two-minute penalties for excessive roughness. BARCELONA - A VIEWERS GUIDE: The Sports","excerpt":"Team Handball"},{"year":"1996","title":"RELATIVELY POPULAR in Europe and parts of Asia but largely unknown in North America, team handball has nothing to do with a ball ricocheting off four walls. Instead, it requires its practitioners to throw, catch, dribble, leap, defend and, above all, score goals. In the 1992 men's Olympic final, the Unified Team (composed of former Soviets) beat Sweden, 22-20, which was hardly high scoring by handball standards. THE SETUP Holger Nielsen, a Danish teacher, codified the sport in the early 20th century to help Danes stay in shape during the winter. Nielsen's game has been called water polo without water, basketball without dunks and soccer with hands. As in water polo, there are seven players to a side. As in basketball, players advance the ball up the court by passing and dribbling. As in soccer, players shoot past a goalie.

This is one reason, you say, that health-care expenditures rose 17.1 percent last year.   Burson-Marsteller has found that employees are generally stuck in attitudes of the 1960's and 70's, when health benefits were considered a given, indeed an entitlement.   But today out-of-control health-care expenditures are undermining the long-term viability of many companies -- and this translates into the job security of employees. Despite paying larger deductibles and co-payments, most employees do not understand that they play an active role in keeping benefits costs down. Smart companies will demonstrate the link between employee and company, and motivate employees to become active stewards of their benefits costs.   Looking at corporate health-care programs that work, we see that most provide financial incentives for cost-cutting choices and are aimed at changing specific kinds of behavior (like bunching benefits claims to cut processing costs). But the most important factors are education and participation. Teamwork is necessary to keep benefits down and profits up. JAMES E.

This effusion, which is damp with tears and whisky, has the distinction of having been directed by David Wark Griffith, whose last production was that splendid film, \\"Abraham Lincoln.\\"Neither Miss Loos, Mr. Emerson nor Mr. Griffith can be said to have accomplished anything particularly novel by this screen work, for, with strong drink as its menace, it seldom rises above that old-time contribution, \\"The Face on the Bar Room Floor.\\" True, Hal Skelly, attacks his r√¥le with a certain ability, but that is not enough to lend much in the way of entertainment to this dismal chronicle, in which during one scene one observes the unfortunate drunkard halting at the sound of voices singing, \\"Abide With Me.\\" In other glimpses Mr. Griffith shows the dark skies streaked with lightning and then a woman in a downpour darting back and forth hysterically.It is the sad story of Jimmie Wilson, a popular young foreman in a steel plant, who swears off whisky before he marries Florrie. But the day dawns when their child falls ill and Jimmie takes a wee one, then another and another. He continues to drink in spite of the disgrace he causes at a party when the engagement of his sister, Nan, and Johnnie Marshall is announced. The owner of the steel plant is there and he resents being pawed by Jimmie and called the \\"big shot.\\" Then, not long afterward, comes the dispossession sequence, and other flashes of Jimmie on his bibulous career, cashing in on his life insurance to quench his thirst and suffering from delirium tremens.But in the end, it is presumed that Jimmie has tasted alcohol for the last time. He still lives and is so remorseful that Florrie and Mary, their youngster, are glad to have him with them.And after it was all over and one had beheld the figure of Jimmie on a sickbed the picture faded from the screen and a very busy Hal Skelly appeared in dress clothes on the stage and, with the aid of men with a spotlight, pointed out former Governor Alfred E.

Mr. Sokolov's shrewd excerpts also bring out (Liebling's) versatility, his perfect matching of tone to subject and his eye for the one detail - the piece of flapping underwear - that makes a scene live.''

PERFECT RECALL: New Stories, by Ann Beattie. (Scribner, $25.) Eleven sparkling stories from the prime student and expositor of the narcissistic, educated, white upper middle class on the East Coast and its elaborate kinship structures.    THE BODY ARTIST, by Don DeLillo. (Scribner, $22.) A tiny, intimate metaphysical ghost story by a master creator of huge, panoramic fiction; it concerns a woman alone in a large seaside house, where a strange man appears in an unused room. DeLillo's pinpoint prose copes with big themes, like the structure of time and the artist's approach to calamity.    THE RISING SUN, by Douglas Galbraith. (Atlantic Monthly, $25.) Galbraith's first novel, set in the late 17th century, offers a perfectly convincing version of what now seems one of history's nuttier schemes: the attempt by a Scottish expedition to colonize the isthmus of Darien (which we now call Panama).    THE DEATH OF VISHNU, by Manil Suri. (Norton, $24.95.) A deft, confident first novel that rarely departs from the landing of a Bombay apartment building, where a servant with a god's name lies dying, while upstairs a nominal Muslim struggles with spiritual difficulties, seeking ''the rapture of faith.''    RIVER TOWN: Two Years on the Yangtze, by Peter Hessler. (HarperCollins, $26.) A finely drawn memoir whose author taught English in the city of Fuling, China, soon to be deluged by the completion of a nearby dam; the strangeness of the Chinese to him, and his to them, are offered in the best tradition of the old-fashioned travel book.    THE GLASS PALACE, by Amitav Ghosh. (Random House, $25.95.) A morally and psychologically complicated novel that examines the deceptions and self-deceptions of India's Anglicized elite, a tribe deliberately created by Britain to think and act Britishly, still going strong after 50 years of independence.    BING CROSBY: A Pocketful of Dreams. The Early Years, 1903-1940, by Gary Giddins. (Little, Brown, $30.) A long, long book by an eminent jazz critic who scrupulously tracks the life and art of a very fine and immensely successful jazz singer and recording artist (and indifferent movie star) who suddenly became unknown in the 1960's.    THE WOODEN SEA, by Jonathan Carroll. (Tor/Tom Doherty, $23.95.) This intellectually diverting novel by an American expatriate based in Vienna crosses from fantasy to science fiction to psychological thriller as it confronts its hero with a dead but teleporting dog, doubles of himself at various ages and other alarming phenomena.
