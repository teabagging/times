And that sum, of course, comes on top of the 20 percent downpayment that most lenders still require before they will issue a mortgage.   One reason closing costs are rising, said Joy Borgos, a housing consultant with Westchester Housing Opportunities, a moderate-income purchase advisory service in White Plains, is that the prices of homes are increasing. Most closing costs are calculated as a percentage of the sale or loan amount.

Their albums, on Warner Brothers, didn't even hint at the ferocity of the music or its sense of expansion. It was so intense that minutes seemed like hours, hours seemed like days, and by the end of now-legendary shows everybody, musicians and audience alike, would wander exhausted out into the early-morning darkness.   The band fell apart a few years later, metamorphosing partly into the softer, better-natured and better-known Neville Brothers, and when most of its members regrouped a few years ago, the music didn't quite work. The improvisations were listless, the rhythms slack. But over the last year things have changed, and if the band doesn't have the volcanic power of youth it used to, it has regained its precision, the feral tautness that made the music distinct.
