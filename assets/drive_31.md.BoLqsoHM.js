It's a nice concept -- but one that's often hard to pull off when you are an American tourist traveling through Europe and struggling to find ways to offset the weakness of the dollar. Here is some help: money-saving tips on everything from hotel rooms to cultural events from New York Times correspondents and contributors in 15 major European cities.       Midway between Old and New Europe, Prague is leading the post-Communist capitals into the modern era. That means higher-quality amenities for tourists -- and higher prices. But there are still plenty of bargains, especially if you can avoid the touristy zone around Prague Castle.    Where to Eat Cheaply       The Czech Republic is home to Pilsen and Budweis, names long familiar to beer drinkers. Without a doubt, Prague still does its best cooking with liquids. For good cheap eats and the best beers at any price, try the Richter microbrewery (Bulovka 17","excerpt":"420-284 840-650), where the owner, Frantisek Richter, produces award-winning lagers and ales in small batches.

And try the labuznicke prkenko, a plate of smoked pork, thick-cut Hungarian sausage and English-style ham served with spicy mustard and eye-opening fresh horseradish for 99 koruna.    Lodging for Under 100 Euros       Prague's hotels are adding hundreds of beds every year, but for now, central-city rooms are in short supply, pushing prices up to Western European levels. Just a short tram ride from Old Town, the Ibis Praha Karlin (Saldova 54; 420-222-332-800; www.hotelibis.cz) has new, well-appointed rooms with air-conditioning in the up-and-coming neighborhood of Karlin, filled with artists' studios and stately 19th-century row residences. Doubles in the summer high season are 91 euros, or about 2,650 koruna, with a buffet breakfast for 262 koruna.    Best Deal on a Cultural Event       Music here is still an excellent value. At the Prague Spring International Music Festival from May 11 to June 3 (www.festival.cz), seats for performances of Smetana, Dvorak, Mozart and others start at 100 koruna, or about $4.35. If you're someone who likes to say, ''I saw her way before she was famous,'' check out the festival's competitions. Battling cellists, for example, will play concertos by Dvorak, Haydn and Schumann on May 14 at the Rudolfinum, the city's premiere venue. Orchestra seats start at 300 koruna. And if you're not fussy about sitting, standing-room tickets for some performances are as little as 50 koruna.    Best Things to Do Free       Wake up before dawn and catch the sunrise from Charles Bridge. It's probably the only time you'll see the ancient stones and statues without a whirlwind of tourists, and the stillness of the city at that golden hour adds a magical touch. When the day ends, stroll around the vast green spaces at Letna Park and Petrin Hill, across the Vltava River from the Old Town, as the sun dips below the city's rooftops and skyscraping spires.    Best Money-Saving Tip       Don't take a taxi without agreeing on the price before getting in. Instead, use public transportation and buy a travel pass for the length of your stay. Trams, metros and buses reach every corner of the city. Your feet will do the rest; Prague is eminently walkable. Pick up maps, timetables and tickets at the travel information desk at Ruzyne Airport (or online at www.dpp.cz). Travel passes for all forms of mass transit start at 80 koruna for one day and up to 320 koruna for 15.

There's something pleasant and marginally uplifting  about seeing 24 contemporary artists and designers take their best shots, in a relaxed summery sort of way, on a strip of real estate as rife with raunchy vitality and decay as 42d Street between Broadway and Eighth Avenue in Manhattan. Intended for pedestrian consumption, the show is a mildly entertaining walk-through, with very little that holds the attention for very long and almost no artist shown to real advantage. Ultimately, the street's powerful cacophony wins out, sweeping all before it like the trashy force of manmade nature that it is.         This year's version includes a couple of holdovers from last year's, neither  distinguished, which seem to have become a permanent part of the Times Square landscape. One is the blocklong sign adorned with brightly colored chairs that shouts \\"Everybody\\" in black capital letters on a taxicab-yellow billboard between Broadway and Seventh Avenue, and seems as much an advertisement for some mysterious product as an exhortation to community. The other is Dick Elliott's \\"Noise Reducing Apparatus, No. 1,\\" a wall of 18,000 safety reflectors in red, yellow, blue and green that has all the simplicity, but little of the charm, of  folk art.

Boston University's 7-6 overtime triumph at Orono on Friday ended Maine's undefeated status this season after 32 games, 30 of them victories. Also concluding were unbeaten streaks of 50 games (46-0-4) at home","excerpt":"44 regular-season games (40-0-4) and 33 contests (30-0-3) against Hockey East opponents.     Mike Prendergast, Boston University's sophomore forward from South Boston, who had been out a month because of a knee injury, ended all that when his shot went by Mike Dunham at 1 minute 50 seconds of overtime. Dunham, a United States Olympian a year ago, had been unbeaten for Maine in his last 24 games. The Terriers overcame a 6-2 deficit.    The next night Maine won, 6-1, and the two referees, Frank Cole and Drew Taylor, called 51 penalties for a total of 150 minutes, both Hockey East records. There were six 10-minute misconduct penalties, all in the third period. Four Maine goals came on power plays.   The Terriers never stopped Paul Kariya, Maine's celebrated freshman, who had seven assists in the two games. Kariya has 44 assists for 58 points, a 2.9 average, in 20 league games. Penalties? One, for two minutes.   Rankings   The voters in The Albany Times Union's poll, 12 coaches and 13 news media representatives, still like Maine. The Black Bears gained 24 first-place votes. The other vote went to No. 2 Michigan. Harvard is No. 3; Miami of Ohio, No. 4 and Boston University, No. 5.    Then come Minnesota-Duluth, No. 6; Lake Superior State, No. 7; Wisconsin, No. 8; Rensselaer, No. 9, and Clarkson and Minnesota tied for No. 10.     The poll ran counter to the Central Association standing, which finds Miami of Ohio continuing in first place with a 3-point lead over Lake Superior State and Michigan. The latter two meet on Friday at Ann Arbor, Mich. Women's Tournament  College hockey for women is making steady progress, according to Heather Linstad, the Northeastern coach. \\"The caliber of players is improving,\\" she said. \\"And there are many more opportunties, like our national team and participation in the Olympic festival.\\"    The Eastern College Athletic Association is sponsoring its first women's tournament, which begins tonight with St. Lawrence (6-6) at New Hampshire (10-4-2) and Princeton (8-7-2) at Northeastern (9-4-2). Rensselaer  The Engineers are a team to watch as the playoffs near. They have won 9 of their last 11 games, which included Harvard's only league defeat. The defense that supports goalie Neil Little gave up more than three goals only once, a 5-2 loss to Vermont.   Rensselaer, second behind Harvard in the ECAC standing and 1 point ahead of Yale, next plays ninth-place Colgate and 11th-place Cornell at home, while the slumping Bulldogs are at Clarkson and St. Lawrence. SUNY Tournament  Plattsburgh's Cardinals, the defending Division III champions, swept through the State University of New York league with an 11-0-1 record.    Next comes a four-team tournament Friday and Saturday in a two-game format, with 10-minute mini-games to break ties. Oswego State (12-12-1 over all and 5-7-0 in the conference) plays at Plattsburgh (19-4-2, 11-0-1), and Fredonia (11-13-1, 7-4-1) visits Cortland State (17-7-0, 8-4-0).

It's a nice concept -- but one that's often hard to pull off when you are an American tourist traveling through Europe and struggling to find ways to offset the weakness of the dollar. Here is some help: money-saving tips on everything from hotel rooms to cultural events from New York Times correspondents and contributors in 15 major European cities.       Cobbled streets, a sleek new subway system, some of the top restaurants in Scandinavia and that ubiquitous Nordic sense of style: It all adds up to a highly attractive -- and costly -- vacation spot. Yet even though this city of Renaissance castles and classic modern design routinely ranks among the 10 priciest places in the world, a recent crop of wallet-friendly hot spots and some enduring gratis experiences mean more mileage for your kroners.    Where to Eat Cheaply       For haute cuisine, the city's best kroner-to-quality ratio is Copenhagen Food Consulting (Abel Cathrines Gade 7","excerpt":"45-3313-6060). A haven of minimalist Scandinavian style in the trendy Vesterbro district, the two-year-old upscale restaurant (known by the locals as Cofoco) offers a seasonal three-course menu of modern Danish-French dishes for 225 kroner (about $37, at 6.3 kroner to the dollar). Offerings might include cod with apple and mint or duck with yogurt, beets and horseradish. Its bargains have made Cofoco a popular cult address, so book in advance. Or hit the streets for a hot dog, the sidewalk specialty of Copenhagen. Sold from pushcarts labeled ''Polser,'' the tube steaks come thick or thin, grilled or boiled, and topped with dried onions, sweet pickles and tangy rémoulade sauce, generally about 20 kroner.    Lodging for Under 100 Euros       The words ''designer-chic'' and ''hostel'' don't usually wind up side by side, but the new Danhostel Copenhagen City (50 H.C. Andersens Boulevard, 45-3311-8585; www.danhostel.dk) is changing that. Outfitted by the Danish design firm GUBI, which helped furnish the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the 16-story hostel has more than 1,020 beds spread over 187 rooms. You can have one of the cool white chambers all to yourself or share with strangers. An Internet cafe, a restaurant and a central location sweeten the deal. Depending on season, a room for two to four people costs 520 or 600 kroners (70 or 80 euros; $86 or $95) a night.    Best Deal on a Cultural Event       Opened last year, the futuristic Copenhagen Opera House, on the island of Holmen (45-3369-6969; www.operahus.dk), has become one of the most talked-about new cultural venues in Europe. Unsold advance tickets to its performances -- a roster of ballets, classical concerts and operas -- are offered to the public at half price at 4 p.m. on the day of the show at the box office at August Bournonvilles Passage 1, in the main square, Kongens Nytorv. (Half-price, same-day tickets for other venues operated by the Danish government are also sold there.) Another bargain: People under 25 and over 65 receive a 50 percent discount when ordering tickets more than a week in advance.    Best Things To Do Free       A number of top museums permanently abolished entry fees in January, including the National Museum (Ny Vestergade 10; 45-3313-4411), and the National Gallery (Solvgade 48-50; 45-3374-8494), a vast space stocked with European art since 1300 (though special exhibitions can have a fee). Also, circle Wednesday on your calendar: Showcasing cutting-edge creations, the Danish Design Center (27 H.C.

The collection includes French Impressionist painting and ancient Greek, Roman and Egyptian art. But it is closed for renovation from May 1 to June 27.    Best Money-Saving Tip       Exploring the bicycle-friendly Danish capital on two wheels is a breeze thanks to 2,000 free bikes the city provides from April through November at 110 racks around town. Simply slide a 20-kroner coin into the slot on the front of the bike to release it from the rack. The coin will be returned when the bike is replaced. More details at www.bycyklen.dk.

The decline is the sharpest one-month drop ever recorded by a public opinion poll in measuring approval of Presidential job performance, according to Andrew Kohut, president of the Gallup Organization. Presidential approval polling began in 1936.   The poll, conducted Sunday, found that a majority of Americans believe that the Reagan Administration is ''covering up'' the facts of its arms deal with Iran and that the incident is at least as serious as the Watergate affair, which toppled the Administration of Richard M. Nixon in 1974. Most Believe Reagan Knew   A majority of the 687 adults questioned by telephone nationwide also said they believed that the President and senior Administration officials knew that money from the sale of arms to Iran was being used to aid the contras, as the Nicaraguan rebels are known.

But families still dream, they still dream for a land of opportunity. And with your vote here this evening, we're going to start working to make those dreams come true. A few things we have to do.

It's a burden upon small business. It's bankrupting working families. It's time we fixed health care. America, we're not investing in our future, we're mortgaging our future. We're borrowing from our kids - almost 9 trillion dollars in debt and growing. It's time for us to fix our budget. Who's been paying attention? How many lobbyists are there for every single Congressman in Washington, D.C.? Sixty three lobbyists for every Congressman … all fighting for the special interests. Let's send some leaders to Washington D.C. to start fighting for the common interest, and start fighting for the common good. It's time to fix Congress. One more number: We have 132,000 of our bravest troops stuck in the middle of a bloody civil war in Iraq. And I say it's high time we bring them home to the hero's welcome. \\"That's the America that Connecticut voted for this evening. I want to say one thing, though, in all seriousness. I want to thank Senator Lieberman for this campaign. I want to thank him for the dignity and decency with which he's represented our state and our country for many, many years, and I'm hoping that over the course of the next few days, we all come to the conclusion that the party's going to stick together and we're going to go forward united. When I got in this race about 8 months ago - it was kind of a dream. A lot of folks said it's an impossible dream.

With all the talk about beta carotene, bottled water and the newly advocated mineral boron, everyone has forgotten how to eat. Here are 10 prevailing nutrition myths:\\n\\n1. All chicken is low in fat.\\n\\nAlthough chicken is generally thought of as a low-fat meat, only a few parts of the chicken qualify. About 19 percent of the calories of a roasted, skinless chicken breast comes from fat","excerpt":"47 percent of the calories of a roasted skinless chicken thigh are from fat. Most people choose chicken over red meat, but don't always come out ahead. (Beef chuck roast, when trimmed, still takes 40 percent of its calories from fat.) If you leave the skin on the thigh and breast and fry instead of roast, fat counts soar. Fast-food chicken is often the fattiest. In an Extra Tasty Crispy Chicken thigh from KFC, 67 percent of the calories are from fat.\\n\\n2. Crunchy foods are high in fiber.\\n\\nNot always. Celery is extremely crunchy but provides less than 1 gram of fiber per half a cupful, chopped. While green peas aren't crunchy, they offer more than 4 grams of fiber a half cup when cooked. And apples and bananas offer almost equal amounts of fiber -- a small apple has 2.4 grams of fiber; a small banana, 2.2. Highly crunchy cereals are not high in fiber. General Mills Oatmeal Raisin Crisp has only one gram of fiber a half cup.\\n\\n3. Ground beef labeled \\"lean\\" or \\"extra-lean\\" is low in fat.\\n\\nThe amount of fat allowed in ground beef labeled \\"lean\\" or \\"extra-lean\\" varies by state and even by store. But most ground beef is anything but lean. \\"Extra-lean\\" beef may have almost 60 percent of its calories in fat. The leanest ground beef is a new product, Healthy Choice Extra Lean Low Fat Ground Beef. It is ground beef, beef stock and oat flour and only 28 percent of its calories come from fat.\\n\\n4. Animal fats have more calories than vegetable fats.\\n\\nThough beef, butter and whole-fat dairy products contain more saturated fats (which raise blood cholesterol) than peanut oil, corn oil or canola oil, they both provide 9 calories per gram, or about 260 calories per ounce.\\n\\n5. Eating a lot of sugar causes diabetes.\\n\\nThe amount of sugar eaten has nothing to do with diabetes, but sugar can aggravate the disease. Diabetics have trouble keeping the level of sugar in their blood stable, so foods high in sugar are usually not allowed or are kept to a minimum.\\n\\n6. Carob is healthier than chocolate.\\n\\nIn its original form (the pods of the carob tree), carob flour is much lower in fat than chocolate or cocoa. But when it is is made into candy, so much fat and sugar are added that the calorie and fat counts of a chocolate bar versus a carob bar are almost the same. A minor advantage of carob is that it lacks caffeine. Chocolate has about 6 milligrams of caffeine an ounce, small compared to a 5-ounce cup of perked coffee, which has six times that.\\n\\n7. Calcium can prevent osteoporosis.\\n\\nMost American women consume less than the Recommended Dietary Allowance of 800 to 1,200 milligrams of calcium a day. A low calcium intake increases risk of developing osteoporosis. But plenty of calcium is no guarantee that you won't develop the disease. Several factors, how often you exercise, hormone levels, heredity, whether you smoke or drink and the amount of calcium you consume, determine the risk of osteoporosis.\\n\\n8. Mayonnaise is high in cholesterol.\\n\\nThough mayonnaise is almost 100 percent fat, usually in the form of soybean oil, it has only about 5 milligrams of cholesterol per tablespoon. Cholesterol-free mayonnaise is available, but 5 milligrams is an insignificant saving, hardly worth looking for a \\"cholesterol-free\\" label.\\n\\n9. Foods labeled \\"sugar-free\\" are low in calories.\\n\\nThe term \\"sugar-free\\" means only that sweeteners other than sugar are used. Products with artificial sweeteners like aspartame or saccharin are lower in calories that those sweetened with sugar. Some \\"sugar-free\\" products are sweetened with sorbitol, fructose, honey or corn syrup, all of which contain the same number of calories per gram as sugar.\\n\\n10. It's important to watch fat and cholesterol in a child's diet soon as they begin eating solid food.\\n\\nThe importance of a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet only applies after the age of 2. The American Heart Association's recommendations for age 2 and up are like those for adults: limit fat to 30 percent of all calories and cholesterol to no more than 300 milligrams a day. Removing fat from a baby's diet can stunt growth; cutting cholesterol deprives the baby of cholesterol needed to form cells, including those of the nervous system. Don't substitute low-fat or skim milk for whole milk or reduced-fat cheese for regular cheese until the baby is 3.

Despite a passionate fan base and a great 53,000-seat stadium (Arena Veltins), this is a tough venue for visitors to get excited about.    GAMES -- It starts with what is likely to be a snoozer, Poland vs. Ecuador on June 9, then jumps to a solid contest when the United States makes its debut against the Czech Republic on June 12. Argentina, a perennial favorite, could face a struggle against Serbia and Montenegro on June 16. Mexico vs. Portugal on June 21 should be a hot ticket as well. A quarterfinal takes place on July 1.    HOTELS -- Though you may still be able to book a room at the Maritim, arguably the city's best hotel (Am Stadtgarten 1","excerpt":"49-209-176-0; www.maritim.de), with few places to stay in Gelsenkirchen, the tourist office (49-209-147-4022, www.gelsenkirchen.de) is likely to direct you to nearby Dortmund or Düsseldorf. A less glamorous option is the bedroom community of Bochum, where the new Courtyard by Marriot (Klinikstrasse 43-45; 49-234-6100; www.marriott.de) has double rooms starting about 89 euros.    NO TICKET? -- Gluckaufkampfbahn stadium will have room for about 20,000 people to watch games on a 645-square-foot video wall. There will be concession stands.    BAR -- Go elsewhere for fancy cocktails and plush lounges. The city's working-class bars serve decent food along with solid regional beers. Some tourists, however, may feel more comfortable at hotel bars like the Beer Keller at the Maritim.    DOWNTIME -- There's that ditch, but a better bet is the Gelsenkirchen zoo, which has an aquarium, water park and animal preserve (Bleckstrasse 47; 49-209-954-50; www.tiergaerten.de/gelsenkirchen-zoo.html; admission is 9 euros).    JAMIE TRECKER The World Cup Made Easy: Gelsenkirchen"},{"year":"2006","title":"Dortmund has completely transformed itself from a coal and steel town, into one of Germany's leading green metropolises and high-tech hubs. Situated in the Ruhr area, an industrial landscape tangled with autobahns, the city has set aside nearly half its land for forests, recreational waterfronts and open spaces like Westfalenpark.    GAMES -- Cultures -- and playing styles -- collide when Sweden plays Trinidad and Tobago on June 10, and Switzerland takes on Togo on June 19. Few are wagering against Brazil in its game with Japan on June 22. But all bets are off when Germany takes on neighboring Poland on June 14. A second-round match takes place on June 27 and a semifinal on July 4.    HOTELS -- Call it the world's biggest dorm: 3,952 bunk beds in a convention hall next to Westphalia stadium (49-231-120-4357, www.fancampdortmund.de). For 35 euros a night, fans will get a no-frills berth, communal bathrooms and place to store their bags. For more conventional lodging, call Dortmund's hotel hotline (49-231-189-99111, www.worldcup2006.dortmund.de).    NO TICKET? -- Games games will be shown on a giant screen in Friedensplatz and Westfalenhalle Arenas 1-3a. Open from noon to midnight for the duration of cup play, the venues will also feature comedy shows, live concerts and soccer films.    BAR -- For the Brazilian match, head over to Steakhouse Rodizio (Rosemeyerstrasse 2-4","excerpt":"49-231-106-3735), a favorite of local Brazilians. Solendo, a riverfront bar, will be holding a Caribbean soccer night for the Trinidad and Tobago game (Speicherstrasse 2A; www.solendo.de). But if you have no allegiance, any of the bars in the lively Kreuzviertel area are a good choice.    DOWNTIME -- After touring the Dortmund Brewery Museum (Steigerstrasse 14; 49-231-840-0200; www.museendortmund.de/brauereimuseum), you'll understand why Germans are outraged over being forced to drink Budweiser at the cup.    GISELA WILLIAMS The World Cup Made Easy: Dortmund"},{"year":"2006","title":"Live well, spend less. It's a nice concept -- but one that's often hard to pull off when you are an American tourist traveling through Europe and struggling to find ways to offset the weakness of the dollar. Here is some help: money-saving tips on everything from hotel rooms to cultural events from New York Times correspondents and contributors in 15 major European cities.       This summer may not be the best time to visit Germany if you're looking for a cheap vacation -- not with the World Cup coming this year. But if you avoid Berlin for most of June and July, especially the weekend of July 9 when it will be the host of the final, you might be able to score some bargains.    Where to Eat Cheaply       Imbiss is German for snack bar, and Berlin is well endowed with them, including plenty where a meal will run you less than 8 euros ($9.92 at $1.24 to the euro). A typical imbiss offers roasted sausages, including the popular currywurst, a sort of Eurasian blend dowsed in ketchup that's laced with curry powder. A popular place is Bier's Mini 7, near the Zoologischer Garten train station at Kantstrasse 7. You can have your wurst with a roll or French fries (called pommes frites in German, as in French, but pronounced POMM-mess FREET-ess), coffee, cola or mineral water, for about 4 or 5 euros.    Lodging for Under 100 Euros       The Art'otel (Lietzenburgerstrasse 85","excerpt":"49-30-887-7770; www.artotel.de) has a central location in what was West Berlin. Officially, the prices run about 120 euros a night for a single and 130 euros for a double. But calling the reservations office directly will usually get you a double for just under 88 euros on most nights. The hotel is minimalist-modern with a collection of original works by Andy Warhol.    Best Deal on a Cultural Event       The Tipi Zelt am Kanzleramt is in the Grosse Querallee -- the same area where at the turn of the 20th century Germans went to be entertained. Near Germany's modern chancellor's office, Tipi, which means tepee in German, is a very large tent that offers cabaret, dance, acrobatics and musical comedy -- as well as dinner and drinks. Tickets range from 8 euros on Mondays up to 40 euros. Information about specific programs and tickets are available at 49-180-327-9358 or online at www.tipi-das-zelt.de.    Best Things to Do Free       Take a walk from Checkpoint Charlie, the only spot where diplomats and Americans could cross the divided city during the cold war, to the almost completed new Hauptbahnhof, or main train station, following roughly the route of the old Berlin Wall and through a landscape that was at the center of the tragic 20th century. Starting at Checkpoint Charlie, roughly where Friedrichstrasse intersects with Kochstrasse, make your way (it won't be hard with a simple Berlin map) to the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe, also known as the Holocaust Memorial, the Brandenburg Gate and then the Reichstag. From there make your way around to the ultramodern parliamentary office building. Straight ahead, you'll see Europe's newest and most modern transportation hub, scheduled to open in time for the World Cup.    Best Money-Saving Tip       Buy passes on the Berlin transit system for inexpensive unlimited access to all buses and trains. You can get passes for one day or one week or even one month, or you can get a Berlin WelcomeCard, which includes either a 48- or 72-hour transit pass for Berlin and nearby suburbs like Potsdam as well as coupons for discounts at museums, restaurants and even fitness centers. The regular passes and WelcomeCards are available at most train platforms. A 48-hour WelcomeCard, good for travel by one adult and three children younger than 14, is 16 euros.

But this centuries-old city does offers top museums like the Sprengel, a clean pedestrian-only central area and, for those headed to the games, a shiny new canopy over the 44,650 seats of the AWD arena.    GAMES -- Highly ranked Italy will make its debut against first-time cup contender Ghana on June 12, followed by a possible upset when seeded Mexico faces Angola on June 16. The only day game here is a toss-up between Costa Rica and Poland on June 20. South Korea, the 2002 host, will try to maintain its momentum when it faces Switzerland on June 23. A second-round game is scheduled on June 27.    HOTELS -- Thanks to a bevy of trade shows, Hanover has an unusually high number of hotels, 92 in all, so securing a room should be a cinch. The easiest way to book is through Hanover's hotel hotline (49-511-123-45555, www.hannover-tourism.de). For more lavish surroundings, head to Residenzstadt Celle about 25 miles away. Luxury hotels there include the Fürstenhof Celle (Hannoversche Strasse 55-56","excerpt":"49-514-120-10; www.fuerstenhof.de). Double rooms start at 175 euros (about $230 at $1.31 to the euro).    NO TICKET? -- Make for Waterlooplatz, a vast square with a 137-foot-high column commemorating the battle at Waterloo. With room for 17,000 fans, Waterlooplatz will have a 645-square-foot screen, a concert stage and an army of local food and beer stands.    BAR -- The bars are style-conscious and expensive. Among the best are HeimW (Theaterstrasse 6; 49-511-235-2303; www.heim-w.de), a minimalist boîte where you can nibble on tapas and sip caipirinhas, and Bronco's (Schwarzer Bär 7; 49-511-260-7453), a popular spot for fashionistas.    DOWNTIME -- Covering some 500 acres, Herrenhäuser Gärten is one of Europe's finest (Herrenhäuserstrasse 4; 49-511-168-47743; www.hannover.de/herrenhausen). Admission is 4 euros).    FARHAD HEYDARI The World Cup Made Easy: Hanover"},{"year":"2006","title":"If you're not familiar with German soccer, you might wonder why this small, forested town is a host city. The reason is the venerable Fritz Walter Stadion, built in the 1920's and completely retrofitted for the cup. In fact, if you look south from nearly any point in the city, you can't help but see the boxy stadium. The city also has a huge United States military base. Expect service members to pack the Fritz Walter.    GAMES -- Sadly, there are few compelling match ups, save Italy vs. the United States on June 17. In other first-round matches, Australia plays Japan on June 12, Paraguay opposes Trinidad and Tobago on June 20 and Saudi Arabia takes on Spain on June 23. A second-round match is on June 26.    HOTELS -- The smallest of the host cities, Kaiserslautern has a serious hotel shortage. The best bet in town is the Hotel Barbarossahof (Eselfürth 10","excerpt":"49-63-141-440; www.barbarossahof.com), where a double is about 85 to 100 euros. If that's sold out, try the city's novel bed exchange, available online at www.kaiserslautern.de/wm2006. Otherwise, head to the nearby cities of Mannheim, Trier or Saarbrücken.    NO TICKET? -- Stiftsplatz and Barbarossastrasse Square will have viewing parties with a giant screen and laser shows.    BAR -- Most bars are attached to hotels, though the Irish House in the city's old center (Eselsfürth 11; 49-631-406-80; www.irishhouse.de) is likely to be host to a lot of Australians on June 12.    DOWNTIME -- Kaiserslautern has a large Japanese garden (Lauterstrasse 18, www.japanischergarten.de), which costs just 3 euros to enter. Otherwise, head out to Trier to visit the Roman basilica and baths.

The city, the safe, green and wealthy capital of Bavaria, is now ranked by Germans as the most desirable place to live, a standing reinforced by the new, doughnut-shaped Allianz Arena -- perhaps the World Cup's most-talked about piece of architecture.    GAMES -- The 2006 World Cup kicks off in Munich with Germany vs. Costa Rica on June 9. One of the least tantilizing matches, Tunisia vs. Saudi Arabia on June 14, will be followed by an interesting coupling, Brazil vs. Australia on June 18. The Ivory Coast takes on Serbia and Montenegro on June 21. The second round also starts there on June 24, and a semifinal is on July 5.    HOTELS -- Most hotels are clustered near the hauptbanhof, or main train station. Among the best is the InterCity (Bayerstrasse 10","excerpt":"49-89-444-440; www.intercityhotel.de), with rooms starting around 90 euros a night. If that's sold out, Munich has a hotel booking service (49-89-233-96555, www.muenchen.de). Shut out in Munich? Try nearby Salzburg, just over the border in Austria.    NO TICKET? -- Go to the Olympiastadion. Built for the 1972 Games, this fabulous open-air arena seats 20,000 and will feature a giant video screen, live concerts and soccer forums.    BAR -- Munich is the beer garden capital. Expect large crowds at the Augustiner-Keller, the oldest beer garden in the city (Arnulfstrasse 52; 49-89-59-4393). For a quirkier scene, the Hirschgarten (Hirschgarten 1; 49-89-17-2591; www.hirschgarten.de) near the Nymphenburg Palace has a large seating area for children and, oddly enough, live deer.    DOWNTIME -- A naturist at heart? The Schönfeldwiese, a meadow in the center of the sprawling Englischer Garden, is the place for you. It is reserved for nude sunbathing, and will be packed with all manner of humanity.    JAMIE TRECKER The World Cup Made Easy: Munich"},{"year":"2006","title":"Nuremberg has a mixed reputation. Once known for its Renaissance arts and sciences, the city was, of course, where the Nazi war crime trials took place. Still, Nuremberg will surprise visitors with its architectural beauty (turrets and stained glass galore) and delicious bratwurst.    GAMES -- Frankenstadion is host to Mexico's opener against Iran on June 11. Possible upsets here include the match between England and Trinidad and Tobago on June 15 and Japan against Croatia on June 18. In a likely sudden-death match, the United States will face Ghana on June 22. A second-round game is on June 25.    HOTELS -- In town? Don't bother. Rooms have been sold out since last year. Hotels in nearby Erlangen and Fürth may still have vacancies. Or try the Nuremberg tourist office 49-911-23-3-6131, www.nuernberg.de) for cancellations. If that fails, contact the FIFA booking service, but don't get your hopes up. This is one of the toughest cities to get a room in.    NO TICKET? -- The Volksfestplatz, on the city's southern edge, is the designated viewing area for fans without tickets and will feature big-screen TV's and Franconian-style beers. It is right next to the Frankenstadion, so expect more foot traffic than in the other viewing areas.    BAR -- For beers and bratwurst, stroll down Königstrasse in the city's old town. For that authentic beer hall vibe, hit the Kloster Andechs (Königstrasse 55). England fans will most likely be crowding into Finnegan's (Königstrasse 80","excerpt":"49-911-203-210; www.finnegansirishpub.de), a cramped Irish pub at the end of the street.
