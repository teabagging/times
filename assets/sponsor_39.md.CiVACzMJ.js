A1    The Pentagon began alerting reservists to the possibility of yearlong duty in Iraq next year as part of a force-rotation plan that calls for decreasing the overall number of forces.

A3    A Jolt for Russian Markets  Russia's minister of natural resources suggested that licenses to develop natural resources could be reviewed and withdrawn, giving already jittery markets another scare. The minister said Yukos Oil could lose the licenses for its oil fields because it was not fulfilling its obligations.   A8    State of Emergency in Sri Lanka  Sri Lanka's president declared a state of emergency, deepening a political crisis in the country.

Thursday's Mostly Mozart concert at Avery Fisher Hall began, however, with Mozart at a distance. The Mendelssohn String Quartet -- more elegant and not nearly as driven with its new violinist, Nick Eanet -- was pretty much smothered by the big space in which it played. An example: the finale of Mozart's D-Major Quartet (K.499), which with some straining of the ears became playing of admirable high-speed precision but which reached normally attentive listeners as a kind of blur.   Felix Mendelssohn's E-Flat Octet enjoyed, by sheer size alone, a more competitive muscle. It was also supported by a robust and joyful performance, one that mixed the best elements of shared gesture and individual free enterprise. Questions along this line -- the ones that ask whether chamber-music playing should be uniform or argumentative, a unanimous chorus or a colloquy between differing personalities -- were more fully explored in the Mozart G-minor Piano Quartet occupying the middle of this program.
