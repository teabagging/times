About two years ago, after a disastrous breakup, Mr. Zustiak began thinking about a piece that would address the various deaths people experience, from trivial incidents like missed phone calls to the loss of loved ones. ''Basically, every day we are saying goodbye to things,'' he said recently after a run-through of the work, which his dance company, Palissimo, performed in a premiere last night. Though the troupe is based in New York, its members are from all over the map: Mr. Zustiak is Slovakian; Saar Harari, a choreographer who also heads LeeSaar The Company, is Israeli; Ellen Cremer, who also performs with LeeSaar, is German. A grasping, sultry duet Ms. Cremer shares with Mr. Harari is one of the highlights of this layered, subtle dance. With a score that runs from Shostakovich to industrial sounds, ''Le Petit Mort'' is also accompanied by images by the Spanish photographer Jose Aragon and a fast-moving collage by the video artist Tal Yarden.

It appears, however, that in transferring the story, which was known as \\"The Impassive Footman,\\" to the screen the footman has been pushed into the background so that the lovers may have that much more opportunity to reiterate their adoration for one another. The English cast is first-rate, with the execution of Owen Nares, who is no longer young and is too dour an actor to make the surgeon the bright young man that the author intended. Betty Stockfeld is a completely charming wife","excerpt":"Allan Jeaves builds a convincing neurotic character out of the husband in this curious triangle, and George Curzon is a proper man of mystery as the footman.The story concerns John Marwood, a man morbidly preoccupied with the state of his health, who has reduced his unhappy household to the condition of a hospital clinic. His young wife, clinging desperately to her vanishing youth, needing brightness and laughter, meets a surgeon who is similarly lonely. As chastely and innocently as a pair of school children, they take to meeting in tea-rooms and at concerts.It is a delicate, fine relationship until Marwood learns about it and accuses his wife of being unfaithful. When he falls ill of a spinal disease he forces the surgeon to perform the unique operation which may save him. If Marwood dies, a letter will be given to the world detailing the husband's sordid interpretation of his wife's affair. If Marwood lives, he promises to take his wife to Europe and a more terrible bondage than before. Through all this moves the impassive footman of the house, like a one-man Greek chorus, speaking quite a good deal to the audience with the lift of an eyebrow.Basil Dean, the producer, has not presented this story with any notable genius. It is haltingly told, the pace is too slow, the dialogue too verbose and the photographic scope too limited. There is an interesting impressionistic bit showing Marwood's feelings as he loses consciousness under the anesthetic. \\"The Impassive Footman.\\""},{"year":"1975","title":"5th Av furrier Saul Arons is closing his shop because of problems fending off shoplifters and thieves","excerpt":"Allan Johnson, chmn of bd of Fifth Av Assn, says he does not know of any other business moving from 5th Av and that he believes crime has diminished from 2 or 3 yrs ago; no other shops in area have reptd major thefts in recent mos; illus of Arons (M) jittery 5th Ave. Furrier Closes Up"},{"year":"1940","title":"HOLLYWOOD, Calif., April 23-- Universal today signed Allan Jones to play the lead in a forthcoming remake of Earl Derr Bigger's novel \\"Love Insurance,\\" to be titled \\"Riviera.\\"   SCREEN NEWS HERE AND IN HOLLYWOOD","excerpt":"Allan Jones to Star in 'Riviera' --Edward G.

Officials said the buyout period would be extended and perhaps begun in other cities.   A1    Iraq's most-wanted militant has pledged his loyalty to Osama bin Laden, according to a message posted on Islamist Web sites. The militant, Abu Musab Zarqawi, is believed responsible for a number of bombings and beheadings.   A10    Little rebuilding has been done in some of the most heavily damaged zones of Najaf. The Iraqi government has taken over responsibility for the reconstruction, and both American and Iraqi officials say they have made recent progress in compensating people.   A11    Marines and Special Forces soldiers captured 17 men suspected of working with the insurgency, including a couple of midlevel leaders and a senior aide to a man believed to be organizing guerrillas.   A11    Referendum on Gaza Refused  Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of Israel rejected a demand by Jewish settler leaders that he hold a national referendum on his plan to withdraw from the Gaza Strip. Mr. Sharon says he sees no future for Jews in Gaza and intends to remove all 8,000 settlers next year.   A6    Vote in Belarus as Expected  Belarussians voted on a constitutional referendum that would allow their country's authoritarian president, Aleksandr G. Lukashenko, to seek unlimited terms in office. After a truncated campaign marred by harassment and corruption accusations, the result was considered a foregone conclusion.   A3    Militants Said to Use Drugs  Forensic analysis has determined that the militants who seized the school in Beslan last month were dependent on drugs. Russian law enforcement officials and politicians have said that those who plan such attacks use hard drugs to coerce suicide bombers or to induce a semi-alert state.   A8    Aristide Blamed for Violence  Haiti's interim prime minister, Gérard Latortue, accused the ousted president, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, of directing violence from exile. Meanwhile, 95 Chinese police officers arrived for China's first United Nations peacekeeping mission in the Western Hemisphere. They will train and provide security.   A3    Talks on Darfur Held in Tripoli  Leaders from Sudan and four regional states wound up a summit meeting in Tripoli with a joint statement rejecting any foreign intervention in the crisis-torn Sudanese region of Darfur.   A8    NATIONAL   A12-15    As Election Day Nears, New Legal Battles Begin  As the secretary of state of Ohio, J.

Democrats sued to block a directive that they say will require election workers to reject thousands of registrations by first-time Democratic voters.   A1    Texas is the linchpin of the Republicans' national strategy to maintain or expand their slim hold on the House, with 5 of the 35 most competitive races in the country. How Texas Democrats threatened by redistricting fare may determine the shape of the Congress for years to come.   A1    Accusing President Bush of plotting to cut Social Security benefits, Senator John Kerry told voters in Florida and Ohio that Mr. Bush's plans for the retirement program could cost them as much as 45 percent of their monthly checks.   A15    Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida publicly ruled out running for president in 2008, quashing, for now, talk of putting a third Bush in the White House.

It was also clear that some leaders have fresh ideas for such challenges as mastering the emerging new media and increasing employment of minorities.   Too bad, then, that turnout was so sparse at the closing general session. Speakers including Gerald M. Levin, the chairman, president and chief executive of Time Warner Inc.","excerpt":"Allen Rosenshine, the chairman and chief executive of BBDO Worldwide, and Roy Bostock, the chairman and chief executive of D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles and the 1993-94 chairman of the Four A's, as the association is known, all had intriguing things to say.   Attendance at the meeting, which began Wednesday, was already low, at around 400 -- of whom only an estimated 150 were agency executives. But it sagged noticeably on the last day, and Mr. Bostock, the final speaker, addressed perhaps 100 people.   \\"After three years of tumult and change, questioning our very value,\\" he said, \\"I'm happy to say the industry is coming back.\\"   One indication, he said, is the \\"resurgence\\" in market share that name-brand products are achieving against cheaper private-label rivals when \\"product quality and strong brand advertising are coupled with value pricing\\" -- in other words, when marketers, including two of his clients, Procter & Gamble and Burger King, lower prices on brands shoppers prefer.   More \\"dramatic evidence\\" of improvement, Mr. Bostock said, is that so-called spot television time is sold out from April through June \\"for the first time in six or seven years\\" in local markets like Atlanta, Washington and Las Vegas, Nev.   Mr. Bostock's optimism manifested itself tangibly after the meeting ended. He spent $1,400 to charter a private airplane at the Greenbrier Valley Airport after mechanical difficulties forced a three-hour delay in the return flight to New York City of a Delta Air Lines jet the Four A's had chartered for those attending.   Mr. Rosenshine, whose agency handles the Delta account, gave no indication he heard the jokes about his client's previous slogan, \\"Delta is ready when you are.\\" In his speech, he compared the new media technologies -- a recurring subject at the meeting -- to \\"a party we'd all better start dressing for\\" or it \\"will go on without us.\\"   \\"The party as we know it is indeed over,\\" Mr. Rosenshine said, because \\"our clients basically and fundamentally no longer accept on faith the value of conventional advertising placed in conventional media.\\" Still, he added, \\"there are other parties around town we can get in on.\\"   Mr. Levin said that while \\"lots of advertisers share this enthusiasm\\" that Time Warner has for parties -- er, new technologies like interactive television -- \\"their agencies don't always.\\"   \\"At best, there's often a lack of urgency,\\" he added. \\"At worst, there's the suspicion this will only take another slice out of an already shrinking advertising pie.\\"   \\"Those of you who jump in sooner will have the chance to participate in the creation of this medium and with the ability to shape and determine its content,\\" Mr. Levin said. \\"If you stand by and wait, it may be very difficult to play a substantial role.\\"   Jay Chiat, the chairman and chief executive of Chiat/Day, posed a provocative question about advertising and emerging technologies: \\"Will it be allowed?\\"   Consumers might need to be paid to watch ads, he added, or \\"might put up with advertising\\" only if it was \\"of enough interest.\\"   \\"This is so critical to our collective and individual futures,\\" he said at a luncheon on Friday. He proposed that \\"each agency select the best and brightest media person\\" to work to \\"create a kind of knowledge fund\\" about new technologies to be shared by all Four A's members.   Mr. Chiat also issued a challenge on another issue: \\"the lack of color at this gathering and in the agency industry in general.\\" He said Chiat/ Day would start a fund by contributing $100,000 over the next four years for programs to encourage members of minorities to enter the industry.   Mr. Chiat recommended that the top 20 agencies make similar donations, raising $2 million; that the next 50 largest each contribute $50,000, for another $2.5 million, and that the remaining Four A's members donate $10,000 each, for another $3 million.   Bruce Lev, a partner and creative services director with Levlane Advertising in Bala-Cynwyd, Pa., immediately pledged that he would be \\"the first small agency to participate.\\" Mr. Chiat also received support from O. Burtch Drake, the president and chief executive of the Four A's, who said he would seek to expand participation in the association's minority advertising internship program.   Indeed, there were no black, Hispanic or Asian-American agency executives at the meeting.
