Readies a Move Against a Defiant Iraq  The Security Council, seeking to avoid a military resolution imposed by the United States, was poised to pass a resolution punishing Iraq with a travel ban and demanding that President Saddam Hussein cooperate fully with an international commission charged after the Persian Gulf war with monitoring Iraq's disarmament. The crisis began when Iraq ordered American inspectors on the team expelled.   A1    Muslim Atrocities in Sarajevo  Witnesses in Sarajevo, along with previously secret court documents, revealed that Muslim militias and paramilitary units killed scores of Serb civilians who remained in the city when it was under siege by Bosnian Serb forces in 1992.   A1    4 Americans Killed in Pakistan  Four U. S. citizens and one Pakistani were killed early today when gunmen opened fire on their vehicle in Karachi, the authorities said. No one has claimed responsibility for the killings, but they follow the conviction Monday of a Pakistani for fatally shooting two employees outside C.I.A. headquarters in Langley, Va. The State Department has warned Americans in Pakistan to watch out for possible retaliation for the conviction.   A3    Russian Bond Sale Is Delayed  Gazprom, the giant Russian natural gas monopoly, postponed a $3 billion bond offering. The company attributed the delay to uncertain market conditions, but it has been subject to pressure from Washington for its role as a major partner in a project to explore for natural gas in Iran. The Clinton Administration was itself under pressure to impose penalties on Gazprom and its French and Malaysian partners for investing in Iran, which the United States accuses of supporting terrorism.   A10    Affirmative Action Wins Abroad  In a decision that could affect affirmative action programs in all 15 European Union countries, the European Court of Justice ruled in favor of a law passed by a German state government enhancing women's access to public-sector jobs. The European Union's highest court ruled that preferential hiring and promotional practices could be used to correct earlier discrimination.   A7    Violent Scuffle in Bethlehem  Israel opened a new fortified complex encasing Rachel's Tomb, a Jewish shrine in an Israeli-controlled part of Palestinian-controlled Bethlehem. A nine-year-old Palestinian boy was shot in the head and critically wounded by an Israeli soldier firing on stone-throwing protesters.   A3    New Twist in Mexican Routine  Mexico's Finance Minister, Guillermo Ortiz, presented the new federal budget to his country's Congress and was duly applauded by members of the Government's party. This time, however, the lower house is controlled by an opposition alliance which has declared its intention to make broad revisions to the budget. Mr. Ortiz's proposed budget increased spending on health care and education for the poorest Mexicans by 20 percent.   A5    NATIONAL   A14-28    Resurgent Labor Being Felt By Democrats in Congress  The stinging blow to President Clinton's trade policy delivered by House Democrats comes at a time when labor's hand has been growing stronger within the Democratic Party. Labor's victory also reflects an important shift in the party's financial center of gravity. Union money is once again predominant, especially for House Democrats, whose financial support from the business community began drying up after Republicans won control of Congress in 1994.   A1    The managers of many American businesses said the inability of Congress and the Clinton Administration to pass the trade measure granting the President broad authority to negotiate trade deals could hurt companies and the economy.   A28    Powell Rules Out Campaign  Retired Gen. Colin L. Powell said he had no intention of seeking the Republican nomination for President or any other political office in 2000.

Florida State officials have confiscated 5,200 absentee ballots as part of their investigation of possible fraud and vote buying in last week's mayoral election in Miami. The investigation began with a tip last month that someone in the campaign of former mayor Xavier Suarez was buying absentee ballots.

A22    NEW YORK/REGION   B1-6    Burden for Homeless Care Shifts to Private Groups  The Giuliani administration is taking the city out of the business of running shelters for single adults and giving the job to private nonprofit organizations that many experts contend are more equipped to handle the homeless. But advocates for the homeless  argue that improved services are allowing the city to let people stay in the shelters for a longer time, and as a result, there is less pressure to create permanent housing -- traditionally the main goal of the city's policy on the homeless.   B1    School File Leaves Legacy  A thick file that teachers and administrators at the Children's Storefront School in Harlem kept on Sabrina Green provides a detailed account of how promising her life could have been -- before she was found dead in her older sister's apartment last week in the Bronx. The sister and her husband have been charged with manslaughter in the death of the 9-year-old girl.

Here are some suggestions on avoiding some of the most frequently made errors when taking pictures:\\n\\nShooting Blanks: Losing every picture because the film fails to move through the camera is most often due to improper loading which results in torn sprocket holes or jammed film. To prevent both of these problems, thread the leader carefully and before closing the back advance enough of the film to insure that both the upper and lower film perforations engage with the ratchet teeth. Then close the camera and advance the film by two more frames to get the exposed film out of the way.\\n\\nAs a double check you should watch the rewind knob when you draw the advance lever to see if it turns. Don't rely on the film counter as it will continue to move whether or not the film does. Because of this, empty cameras with frame numbers appearing in the window are sometimes thought to be loaded - so always check by twisting the rewind knob clockwise to feel for tension.

And what about the individual who lives on a private road or in a condominium complex not covered by the town's plowing services?   Municipal officials say there is little that arouses greater ire among homeowners than the thought that their road has been overlooked and left unplowed during a heavy snowstorm.
