And the bishops, some of whom have been harshly criticized for covering up for predator priests, adopted a broad definition of sexual abuse that includes situations that do not involve force or even physical contact. Catholic reaction included satisfaction, disappointment, and concerns that the measures would pit bishops against priests and that the policy is too harsh for a church built on the concepts of forgiveness and redemption. It is unclear how the bishops' decisions will be received in the Vatican.

It's hard to imagine, though, that even a listener entirely unaware of Shostakovich's story could listen to his major works -- the symphonies, quartets and operas -- and not get a sense of what he was about. It may be a confusing sense, actually: works seeming to glorify the state mingle with works of bitterness and intensity that seem mainly to evoke struggle and protest. It can seem, in fact, as if bitterness was his driving force.    But Shostakovich also had a lighter side. Dmitri Kitaenko, conducting the Frankfurt Radio-Sinfonie Orchestra, offers four suites that are as cloud-free as anything Shostakovich composed (RCA 09026-68304-2). Two of them, the Ballet Suites, Nos. 1 and 3, are compilations of dances from Shostakovich's early ballets and movements from his incidental music for the theater, cobbled together by Lev Atovmyan to help raise money for Shostakovich after he was denounced as a formalist in 1948.

Mr. Adlesic was an amusingly innocent lost soul looking for love in \\"Blue,\\" which opened the program. Set to popular blues songs sung by Jimmy Scott, the solo has Mr. Adlesic flirting with an elegant mannequin who suddenly appears on stage. Even a pair of red glittery shoes -- Dorothy's in \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" -- don't make this romance any smoother or more possible. But \\"Blue\\" is a touching, often very dark picture of loneliness and dating games, performed by a dancer who knows how to use his distinctive presence to the fullest.    \\"Black and White,\\" danced to music by the Tango Project, does not accomplish its goal of comparing homophobia to racism. Instead, Mr. Adlesic, who is white, and Niles Ford, who is black, move through a flowing series of vignettes about both forms of hatred with almost the approach of a diary writer. Though Mr. Adlesic wrote and choreographed \\"Black and White,\\" the new piece seems most of all a project created by two friends to examine, onstage, shared memories, conversation and arguments about being gay and being black.

In \\"Crossings,\\" he confirms what most of us already know or surmise: blacks and whites dwell in separate worlds. Even in a democracy, trying to break down this divide remains, as Gunnar Myrdal called it in his classic study a half-century ago, \\"An American Dilemma.\\" Nevertheless, Mr. Harrington adds the skill of an engaged reporter, a personal stake in his subject and the ability to find fresh voices to talk openly about themselves and multi-racialism.
