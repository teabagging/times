The 27-year-old Italian singer and songwriter, who appeared at Radio City Music Hall on Friday evening, creates music that underlines a time-honored Mediterranean melodicism with rock beats and synthesized textures. In his best songs, the styles of Julio Iglesias and George Michael coincide comfortably. One minute the instrumentation might suggest the sound of a concertina, the next the latest space-age pop sound effects.   Mr. Ramazzotti has the additional advantage of good looks, which, like his music, combine a continental ideal of class with the funkier aura of English-speaking rock stars like Mr. Michael. Mr. Ramazzotti, who was shown in closeup on two large video screens throughout the concert, wore his hair slicked back into a bushy ponytail. His slightly arrogant poses suggested the demeanor of an international tennis star. The athletic aura was accentuated by a cast on his left foot, which he explained was a result of a recent motorcycle accident.
