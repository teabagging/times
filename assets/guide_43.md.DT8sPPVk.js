Students now are taught by the very nature of the college admission process that they must compete with grades, SAT scores and many other individuals to be admitted to the college of their first choice. Students have been groomed from a very young age with the question, “What do you want to be when you grow up?” that many have been focused on their life’s aspirations for many years prior to stepping foot on campus. Students seem to almost grow up quicker and have many more life experiences prior to college age. They read books in high school that were once required reading for college and this puts them ahead of where previous college students were at the start of their college experience. They have the chance to go abroad on school trips and have life experiences that were once reserved for the college student. Students in the 1960’s and 1970’s led more sheltered lives prior to college. Theses student’s life experiences with politics, taking action for a cause and new found freedoms, began when they left the confines of their homes and arrived on a college campus. Students today have much more information available to them via the internet and 24 hour cable news reports and are informed and aware of the world around them at a much younger age. The students from a generation ago had a more limited amount of exposure to the world’s events. Their parents had more control over the amount of information one received from radio, television and newsprint. Good or bad the children of today are exposed to a constant amount of news from all areas of media. Today’s students have already had opportunities to join and be part of many causes such as Relay for Life or MS walk and do not have to wait until they are out of the house and on a college campus before becoming part of a cause.
