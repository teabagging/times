The music was exclusionary, either intentionally or not: those who didn't like that one sound weren't welcome. Whatever their values, punk was limited by its anti-professionalism, and rap was limited by its canned quality, by the lack of onstage musicianship.   The Beastie Boys' show at Roseland on Saturday night mixed rock and funk played by the band with rap from turntables. In its own wildly sloppy way, the choices the band made seemed both democratic and logical. Democratic because it was inclusionary both racially and musically, and logical because in the use of real instruments, the band had found a way through the problems offered by the genres. The result was one of the more exciting shows of the year, even if the band rambled, even if the words were unintelligible and even if the show was uncomfortably packed. By the end of the concert, the band had played and done just about everything that post-punk and rap can do.
