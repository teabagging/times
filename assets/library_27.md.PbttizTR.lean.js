Until it was closed in 1987, the Thalia was a mecca for cineastes who wanted to bone up on their Cocteau, Kurosawa and Welles.    Built in 1931, the 292-seat theater was architecturally novel for its times. Its Art Moderne design, by Raymond Irrera and Ben Schlanger, incorporated such innovations as indirect lighting and a sloping floor. Beginning in 1938, under the direction of Martin Lewis, it offered a steady stream of foreign films. After he died in 1955, the repertory expanded to include classic Hollywood movies. From 1977 to 1987, under the direction of Richard Schwarz, the programming became more offbeat and esoteric. During its peak years, the Thalia was famous for its inky darkness, its tiny screen and the intense concentration of its audiences.

I like to call this the Finite Life Phenomenon.  It is a cycle, a rising and falling rhythm that crops up in diverse folkways of suburban life. We see it here as crowds and no crowds on the tennis court, and string quartets forming and falling apart. I suppose it is just the rise and fall of one fad or another, but I like to think about meanings.\\n\\nAbout five years ago the asphalt tennis courts in our town went from deserted wastes of sunlight to hotly contested turf with identification cards and much nastiness surrounding allotted hours.  The trim physique, the cardiovascular benefits of sweat, the newest racquet, the most dashing young pro - all surfaced in our suburban enclave. That late 1970's narcissism fed on the competitive victories, the lovely equipment, the good legs and the image held inside of a real fighter elegantly swatting aside all stops on the taut rise to victory. Even in not-so-grim circles, the matrons volleyed about while the children slid on the slide and ate the sandbox sand unattended. Just sweating a little over something that did not demand a cookie was sustenance enough for awhile.

The industry's 12-month hangover began with cataclysmic retail bankruptcies and ended with holiday sales figures that showed once and for all that there is no Santa Claus.   Even Tiffany & Company, supposedly immune to recession, revised its profit expectations for the fourth quarter, citing poor domestic sales, and its stock dipped sharply last week. The resort season has been virtually ignored by the stores and mostly unadvertised amid the retail nervousness.   New perfumes, once sure profit makers, have been bombing with alarming regularity. One called California (finally, a fragrance named for a state!), which made its debut at Bloomingdale's in 1990, is already being sold at Duane Reade.   Walking down Seventh Avenue the week before Christmas, one could pick up handbills advertising a dozen showroom sales between Times Square and Macy's. The inside joke called \\"Saturday selling\\" has now become a seven-day event.   One retail analyst, Kurt Barnard, says the recession will not be nearly as deep and prolonged as that of 1982. In his Retail Marketing Report for December he points out that, unlike the situation in 1982, inventories now are low, and he says that energy prices, which cut into discretionary spending, will ebb in the spring, releasing pent-up demand.   In the meantime, fashion executives are tightening their belts, eliminating bonuses and laying off workers. Of course their chauffeurs will be the last ones to go.  Enter Bodywear     It was the year of the woman on Seventh Avenue. Donna Karan was named the designer of the year by the Council of Fashion Designers of America. She and a test-tube product called Lycra injected the only real vitamins into the fashion business.   But designers must face the bodywear look with trepidation. Besides leggings and a jacket, what else does anyone need? The look is easy and modern -- qualities designers have talked about for years -- but all one needs to buy are pieces. Leggings or a tube skirt cost $50. Add a jacket and a great haircut. Who needs to spend $600 on a gingham blouse?   Women have seemed less passionate about clothes. Many were no longer fain to wear their diamonds in public","excerpt":"the rich were hiding their furs.   Men, on the other hand, took fashion to an opposite extreme. The slang \\"to die for\\" and \\"fashion victim\\" gained frightening resonance as young men killed for \\"eight ball\\" leather jackets, \\"pump\\" sneakers and shearling coats. The Ins and the Outs     Nostalgia continued to influence the runways. Some fashion historians say that the end of a century summarizes and refines all its styles. So, in the 1980's, people dressed like the 50's. Now there is a rebirth of the 60's: vinyl skirts, bouffant hairdos and lots of eyeliner. The 1970's are certainly on their way, even if nobody wants to see leisure suits again.   So the trends of the 90's are old trends. Gingham and Doris Day. Audrey Hepburn and the Kelly bag. Superfly and hot pants. In the new Vogue, there are even Diane Von Furstenberg and Courreges. Who said they could come back?   The cycles in fashion get shorter and shorter. How many times have the 60's been revived since the 60's? They're never out long enough to be completely out. Soon all the decades will overlap dangerously. Soon everything in will simultaneously be out.   It will be the dawn of the millennium. New stores will open, everything will be fabulous and sell like crazy, and no one over size 14 will ever wear spandex again.

This isn't exact chronology. Mr. Tweedy has been doing solo shows, sporadically, since 1997. (There was one other full-fledged solo tour in 2001.) And even in the old days, the original version of his main band, Wilco, could stretch out pretty well on a song.

While welcoming President Reagan's recent endorsement of bilingual elections, as important as the bilingual provisions are to Hispanics, they do not represent the extent of the voting discrimination we face. President Reagan's support of the bilingual provisions stops far short of addressing the breadth of the problem.

This may be  because of his involvement in a prison rehabilitation program stressing ''positive addiction,'' specifically, addiction to long-distance running.         As a prisoner at the Federal Correctional Institution in Fort Worth, Tex., the 37-year-old Burt has been allowed, under the watchful eyes of prison guards, to participate in local running events. The program of positive addiction seems  to be working, at least for Burt, who has completed two marathons in the program and is apparently hooked on the sport. He also seems to be susceptible to runner's high, which in this case is obscuring some hard realities.

In Philip Roth's ''The Ghost Writer,'' a character says that voice is ''something that begins at around the back of the knees and reaches well above the head.''

We lawyers get involved with people who have messed up their lives, and their mistakes make fascinating stories. Street lawyers see the underbelly of society. Corporate lawyers see high-stakes shenanigans. And since law school and bar exams require some measure of talent with the written word, lawyers think they can add a twist here and a subplot there and produce a real thriller. Second, most lawyers would rather be doing something else. The profession is overcrowded and the competition is fierce. Most of the work is terribly boring. There is tremendous dissatisfaction within the profession, and almost every lawyer I know is looking for a way out. Third, lawyers dream of big, quick money. A gruesome car wreck, an oil spill, a fat fee for a leveraged buyout, a large retainer from a white-collar defendant. It just goes with the turf.

Russia's dark history keeps intruding into the euphoria of glasnost and perestroika. Toward the close of the 20th century, the 19th century's prejudices and xenophobia remain alive in the republics of the former Soviet Union. That is the frightening message of Walter Laqueur's revealing new book, \\"Black Hundred.\\"    To the inchoate groups on the extreme right who are increasingly influential in the political and social life of Russia, Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Boris N. Yeltsin are considered enemies of the state. The new nationalistic superpatriots are opposed to rapprochement with the West. Anti-Americanism is very much present in the anti-democratic language used by leaders of the extremist parties.

Of Palm Beach, FL, a private investor, sportsman, and philanthropist died on Friday, December 24, 2004 at Hospice of Palm Beach County following an extended illness. He was 97. Born in Barrie, Ontario (Canada) on May 10, 1907, his parents were Thomas Henry Ford and the former Rachel Mary Jones. His family moved to Rochester, New York when he was a child, where he completed his secondary education and then graduated from the University of Rochester, College of Engineering. Mr. Ford was a leader and innovator who never allowed anything to deter him from further exploration. At the age of 38, he left his position as Vice President of Engineering at the Rochester Manufacturing Company to establish a new company when he became aware of a major deficiency in the manufacturing industry of heavy electronic transformers and generators of diesel engines while using gas and flame without protective devices from unexpected accidents.In 1948, Mr. Ford founded QUALITROL Corporation in Fairport, New York to fill that need and provide the electric utility industry with the protective devices and monitor the systems for transmission and distribution. He opened a branch of QUALITROL in Waynesboro, TN to manufacture valves. Mr. Ford bought the MICROCONTROL in St. Louis, MO, a manufacturer of thermostats, and the DYNAPAR CORPORATION in Gurney, IL a manufacturer of digital controls. In the late 1960's, he sold all of his business interests to devote more time to his love of sports. As a child, Mr. Ford was a natural athlete who excelled in skiing, hunting, horseback riding, salmon fishing, and sailboat racing. Of all these activities,the one that Mr. Ford always referred to with the most passion was sailboat racing. He started sailing at the age of twelve and was ''hooked'' at the tender age of fifteen when he crewed in a Canadian Cat dingy. (He later introduced from England the International 14' racing dingy) Over the years, Mr. Ford won countless cups in national and international waters with different sailing boats, some of which he helped to improve the design. Among his many championships, he won the Canadian Douglas Cup in 1934 as the first American to win it since 1925","excerpt":"the Rochester Race that covered several hundred miles across fresh water; the Isaac Bell Trophy at Cowes Week in England; and several races in the Great Lakes. Mr. Ford was an upland game hunter most of his life and helped increase the membership in the Ruffed Grouse Society of North America from 150 members to 3000 members after he became its President. He was a member of the Royal Canadian Yacht Club; the Rochester Yacht Club; The New York Yacht Club; the the Rochester Country Club; the Sporting Rock Beach Association in Newport, R.I.; and the Everglades Club, and the Bath and Tennis Club both of Palm Beach, Florida. Mr. Ford was very interested in good, responsible government. Among his many friends were General Dwight Eisenhower and Nelson Rockefeller, as he organized the industry in support of their political campaigns. He was a past Chairman of the Palm Beach Long Range Financial Planning Committee, and most recently was very active in the Absentee Vote of Republicans Abroad. Mr. Ford was preceded in death by his first wife Mary Louise Watters Ford, who died in 1970. In 1974, he married the former Beatriz Algarra-Cuellar of Bogota, Columbia. In addition to his wife, Beatriz, he is survived by a daughter from his first marriage, Louise Ann Ford; and a grandson, Nicholas George Grant, both of London, England. The family will receive friends on Wednesday, December 29, 2004 from 6:00 until 9:00 PM at Quattlebaum Funeral Home 1201 South Olive Avenue, West Palm Beach, FL 33401.

What greets us instead - designed with Hockney-esque verve by David Gropman - is an airy, glass-and-blond-wood mansion in the ritzy Los Angeles enclave of Bel Air. This time Mr. Hwang's Chinese-Americans have made it big in the promised land.   Very big. Robert (Michael Paul Chan), a middle-aged patriarch in the new play's extended family, is a self-made bank president and master of tax shelters.

The leading rôles are filled by that engaging team, Dorothy Mackaill and Jack Mulhall. This sketch, an agreeable hot weather entertainment, owes its plot to Kenyon Nicholson and its direction to Harry Beaumont.Miss Mackaill figures as Kitty Weaver, a department store sales girl, and Mr. Mulhall officiates as David Pickett, a good-natured plumber. Until his somewhat disconcerting experience of being mistaken for a motion picture actor, who has refused a small fortune to appear under the banner of a certain producer, Mr. Pickett is proud of his useful, but by no means humble, calling. He has no intention of masquerading as a screen player, but Miss Weaver and others he encounters at a seashore resort, referred to as Bradley Beach, refuse to listen to any denial of the profession foisted upon him. Therefore he endeavors to live up to the idea of a Hollywood leading man by reciting \\"The Shooting of Dan McGrew\\" and \\"The Charge of the Light Brigade,\\" also by warbling \\"The Curse of an Aching Heart\\" and demonstrating his dancing skill.His nemesis is a life saver named Sid Winters, who gloatingly informs a packed theatre of Mr. Pickett's true vocation.Miss Mackaill is not only charming and competent, but she is to be congratulated on her sensible attire. Her appearance lends a helpful naturalness to the part. In the talking episodes she also reveals marked ability. She speaks her lines as if she were talking to another character, and not, as is so often the case, as if she were reciting them for the benefit it of the audience. Her joys and woes as Kitty Weaver are effective, even though there are a few fractious moments in this slice of holiday life.Although there is a heap of good fun in this offering. Kitty has her disappointments. At the outset her parents learn from the floorwalker of the store that their daughter is expected to report for duty the following Monday instead of going on her vacation. This is, however, forestalled by the intrepid Agnes, who telephones the floorwalker, calls him a shrimp and otherwise upbraids him, to the end that he is impelled to think himself fortunate in permitting Kitty, after all, to take her two weeks off. Gertrude Astor is splendid as the flip and fiery Agnes.Jimmy Finlayson does well as Pa Weaver and Kate Price affords awe and amusement as the adipose Ma Weaver. Eddie Gribbon engenders humor by his actions as the thickheaded lifesaver who would a-wooing go with the fair Kitty.Max Schmeling, the German pugilist, is to be seen and heard in a Vitaphone short subject. He gives a demonstration of a one-round bout and talks in German and English. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"The Romantic Vacation. Youth Wins Out. A German Biography. Not a Laugh in a Carload.

The week's events seemed as carefully orchestrated as a Sousa, or maybe a James A. Baker 3d, march: Tuesday, the British Foreign Minister warned that time was running out for President Saddam Hussein of Iraq. Wednesday, President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt said war was inevitable unless Iraq withdrew from Kuwait in two or three months. Thursday, President Bush ordered at least an additional 150,000 troops to the Persian Gulf. And, in Moscow, the Soviet Foreign Minister sounded a softer but still harmonious note by admitting the possible use of force. Traders, who sent the price of oil below $32 a barrel on Monday, raised it to $35.53 after President Bush spoke. On Friday, oil finished at $33.89, as market participants decided that armed conflict was unlikely for the rest of the year. William L. Randol, an analyst at First Boston, figures that oil supplies will be tight enough to keep prices at about $30 through the winter. He adds another $5 or so for rising fears of war. \\"It's workable if nothing goes wrong,\\" he said. \\"But the history is that things do go wrong.\\"   The Non-inflationary Recession  The brighter side of this economic slowdown is that it is keeping higher energy prices from raising the cost of much else. Producer prices rose 1.1 percent in October, after even higher increases the two previous months. Take out food and energy, and core producer prices in October were flat. Economists say that, with a recession more likely, only a few industries like airlines can raise their prices. Joseph Carson, senior economist at Chemical Bank, said higher energy costs will show up instead in reduced corporate profits, wages and employment. If the last two oil price shocks increased inflation, \\"this one may be more deflationary,\\" he said. \\"The pressures to discount prices because of a weakening economy appear to be winning out.\\"  'Big Green' Wilts  Messages from a restive electorate: Let environmental issues wither, but let the tax battles resume. California's \\"Big Green\\" ballot proposition, described as the nation's most comprehensive environmental program, united many industries to help bring about its defeat. New York State turned down a $2.1 billion environmental bond act, leaving communities to pay for mandatory recycling and search for new landfills. While Republicans limited their off-year losses on Capitol Hill, Democratic gains in state capitals give them an advantage in redistricting come 1991. Voters handed over governorships to different parties, or independents, in 14 states, causing some governors to reconsider increased taxes. President Bush tried on Thursday to retread his no-tax pledge for the future -- \\"It ain't going to happen, I'll guarantee you,\\" he said. Democrats, sensing the President's weakness, talked of reviving their proposal for a surtax on the wealthy. An Early Christmas  No wonder their wreaths and tinsel and tree ornaments are already up. The department stores desperately want Christmas shopping to begin. The nation's major retailers reported an awful October, with sales down 1.2 percent from last October at Sears, Roebuck, and down 4.9 percent at J.C. Penney. But at Wal-Mart, sales were up 25 percent. A Legal Cartel for Airlines  To some travelers, it seems that the airlines are behaving like the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. The International Air Transport Association agreed last week to raise fares 4 to 8 percent, after authorizing raises in the same range about three months ago. Washington has given United States airlines antitrust immunity for taking part in the group. Consumer advocates growled, but analysts said the airlines are sharing the pain. \\"There is absolutely no gouging taking place,\\" said Paul Karos, an analyst at First Boston. \\"The industry isn't coming close to recovering its fuel cost increases.\\" The nation's airlines have also raised domestic fares about 9 percent since the gulf crisis began. With the economy weakening, Mr. Karos said, the airlines are unlikely to push prices higher unless there is war.   COMPANIES   Volvo's Car-Crushing Ads Backfire  The roof has caved in on Volvo's advertisements. The Swedish company tried to dramatize the safety of its cars with commercials showing a monster pickup truck, emblazoned \\"Bear Foot,\\" crunching a row of cars and leaving only the Volvo intact. A dramatization it was: the Volvo roof was reinforced","excerpt":"the roof on another car weakened. When charged with false advertising by the Texas Attorney General, Volvo promised not to make unverified safety claims but said its advertising agency, Scali McCabe Sloves, had acted without its knowledge. Volvo ran disclaimers in several newspapers, while one executive bemoaned the public's failure to get a joke. Twisted Market  The bond market's byzantine mechanics: A ratings downgrade for Citicorp debt on Monday raised prices for other issues, without hurting Citicorp itself. Citicorp's firmness was simple: traders had anticipated the downgrade, by Standard & Poor's. But investors did not let the misfortunes of the nation's largest bank holding company scare them into dumping other bonds. Instead, they bid up other issues, saying they expected a recession, with interest rates bound to fall. Then, on Wednesday, Citicorp tried to raise investor confidence in its own securities by deciding to redeem $275 million in preferred stock.  Darryl Defects  It's bad enough that several investment banks are talking about leaving New York City. But last week, Darryl Strawberry decided to move his business from New York to Los Angeles. The Mets offered their leading home-run producer $15 million for four years. Like some Wall Street managing directors who earn almost as much, he felt abused, maligned and cheated. \\"I don't think the front office of the New York Mets appreciated Darryl Strawberry,\\" he said. And so to the Los Angeles Dodgers for the chance to play in his hometown at $23.5 million for five years. \\"I couldn't sleep,\\" said Tommy Lasorda, the Dodgers manager. \\"I was so excited.\\" Lasorda might not sleep much come this spring, either, because now he has to manage a guy whose temperament makes a Salomon bond trader seem blissful and serene. In Brief  The Nieman-Marcus Group will not carry the General Cinema label. The General Cinema Corporation withdrew its $240 million, $14.40-a-share offer for the 40 percent of the retailer it doesn't own after several shareholders filed suits saying the price was too low. The Burger King Corporation helped end a boycott by a religious group with newspaper advertisements last week boasting of the company's support for \\"traditional American values on television.\\" The group accused Burger King of sponsoring shows having \\"gratuitous sex, violence and anti-Christian stereotyping. Prudential-Bache is laying off as many as two-thirds of its investment bankers as Wall Street firms continued to retrench. INTERNATIONAL   Seoul Races to the Soviet Union  The first brand name that passengers arriving at Moscow's international airport see is not Marlboro, Pepsi, or Sony, but Samsung, emblazoned on every luggage cart. South Korea is rushing to secure a place in the Soviet market before the Japanese arrive. While the Japanese try to settle a territorial dispute with the Soviets, South Korea has re-established diplomatic relations, arranging to buy Soviet raw materials and offer steel and electronics in return. On Monday, Ju Young-Chung, the chairman of the huge Hyundai industrial and construction group, met with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev at the Kremlin. The South Korean press reported that Mr. Gorbachev asked for Hyundai's help in developing the Soviet Far East and easing shortages of consumer goods. Mr. Chung asked Mr. Gorbachev to help improve relations between the two Koreas. Progress on both fronts is likely. South Koreans hope to give their products the same cachet in the Soviet Union that Sony has in the West. One immediate problem with selling consumer goods to the Soviet Union, says Robert K. Kim, vice president of the Korea Fund, which invests in Korean securities: \\"The Russians can't pay for them.\\" Bringing Phones to Poland  Poland wants the fruits of its newly free markets to include a $15 billion telephone system by the turn of the century. The Government intends to abandon the state monopoly on domestic phone service, opening the field to Polish and foreign competitors. Communications Minister Jerzy Slezak said on Friday that the new communications system would increase the telephone count from 3.8 per 100 people to 30 in 10 years. Some 7,000 Polish villages are now without service. The Soviet Union has 15 phones per 100 people; the United States has about 50. Two American companies, which the Polish Government refuses to name, are among the five vying to set up a cellular network to serve 200,000 users.

The woman in the case is Mimi Howell, impersonated by Mary Astor, who gives an appealing and easy performance.Although the fun in this chronicle is not notable for its novelty or subtlety, it is effective, largely because Mr. Bancroft happens to be the target. One may be amused when the stalwart Joe Forziati outwits a building racketeer, but one laughs heartily when Forziati struggles with a new swallow-tail coat under a tailor's supervision and also later when he has his troubles in buttoning a collar and tying a white bow. There is a nice touch in another chapter when, after playing with Mimi Howell's little boy, Forziati discovers to his chagrin that his bow has come undone. He admits frankly to Mrs. Howell that the knotting of it is beyond him and she helps him out of his dilemma.All the early sequences are not only well acted, but thoroughly interesting. It is not until after the redoubtable Forziati becomes so enamored of Mrs. Howell and proposes marriage, that things take a turn for the worse. Mrs. Howell, who is awaiting her divorce decree from her husband, played by Frederic March, tells Forziati that she has to consider her child and therefore cannot marry him.Forziati is presumed to be mentally alert when it comes to gangsters and racketeers, but, nevertheless, Mike Mendino, who has his reasons for hating the building contractor, is strangely successful in foisting on Forziati one of his underlings as a chauffeur. This man, named Slip, has been saved from jail on a kidnapping charge by Mendino, and it is to Slip that Forziati turns in his final attempt to win Mimi Howell's favor. His idea is to have Mrs. Howell's youngster kidnapped and then recover the child. Joe, however, subsequently learns to his dismay that Slip has confided the plot to Mendino, who has not only taken charge of Mimi Howell's little lad, but has also kidnapped Forziati's own youngster.To the average onlooker it seems impossible for Forziati to outwit Mendino this time, but, with the aid of the screen writers and the director, he does, and in heroic fashion.Mr. Bancroft plays his part well and toward the close he gives vent to his thunderous laugh.Mr. March tackles a minor rôle with his unfailing skill.

But Salem is a different matter. It takes its name from no English county or cathedral town, and one comes to it without the weight of nostalgic associations. 12. Paris with its long humanistic tradition, as a city known to value and respect those who create, was for the Tournon Crowd both a cultural and racial haven. 13. The sally is the first tree to green and the first to wither","excerpt":"the rowan berries are an incredible orange in the light from the lakes each September. 14. Parisian gloom is not simply climatic, it is a spiritual force that acts not only on building materials, on walls and rooftops, but also on your character, your opinions and judgments. 15. Like the Pharoahs, the landscape itself is dead, enlivened only by the tourists who lend some movement and color to a barren and mortuary area. 16. The next time I look, the sky above the far peaks has been painted with broad streaks of brilliant orange on a ground of cerulean, the last stars are fading overhead, and the bay is silent. Then the voices of the waking birds begin. 17. Speaking of venison, I do remember my first haunch. 18. It isn't necessarily the great and famous beauty spots we fall in love with. As with people, so with places: Love is unforeseen, and we can all find ourselves affectionately attached to the minor and the less obvious. 19. From the coastal bluffs to the north, I now realize, I could easily watch Kurile seals cut the wild, jade-green water of the ocean. Such animals draw a visitor quickly out of himself and into the land -- the sight of them alone is exhilarating. 20. We have watched the Nakhi women coming down from the Snow Range, with their bundles of pine and artemisia; and one old woman with a bamboo winnowing basket on her back, and the sun's rays passing through it.

He gives to his work excellent timing and eminently satisfactory camera technique. There is no straining for effect, no extravagantly depicted incidents, which one might expect in the filming of such a tale, and the settings are realistic.Mr. King permits his comedy to come along unobtrusively and, having talented performers in his cast, he is able to give many a human touch and aid in the splendid characterizations. Lionel Barrymore adds another of his shadows to the many that are busy on the screens in many lands. His make-up here as the mentally unbalanced Bob Connelly is unusually fine and his performance knows no flaws. Of some of his scenes he makes stories within a story as Mr. Bob recalls the past and the glories and valor of the battlefield.Then there is Henrietta Crosman, who lends her talent to personating the unsympathetic and disdainful Mrs. Connelly, a woman who frowns at the mere thought of a Northerner. Robert Young is very welcome as the unaffected Will Connelly, who well knows that while his mother is stiff-necked with pride the family actually need food in the house. The local grocer is tired of giving the Connellys credit. Will takes an interest in Joanna Tate (Miss Gaynor), a girl who hails from the North, but has Southern relatives. It is this pathetic Joanna who virtually shows the way to the Connellys to regain their former independence. And she has a frightful time trying to persuade them that growing tobacco will pay them far better than growing cotton. Mrs. Connelly is adamant, until Will shows her that he can also be obstinate. Up to the last reel Will bows to the dictates of his mother, but he suddenly flares up and elects to wed Joanna.Stepin Fetchit, who could probably get a handicap from a tortoise or a snail in a race, gives a comic exhibition as a combination stable worker and butler. Richard Cromwell appears as a grocer's assistant, who is so pleased to see Joanna in the store that he would give her anything she desires. Russell Simpson makes the most of the grocer, who is forced to keep a close eye on his customers' bills.The stage show includes an orchestral interlude, \\"Through the Magic Curtain,\\" with Beatrice Belkin, the chorus and the ballet corps","excerpt":"the Roxyettes and Edith Murray; \\"Heaven-Bound,\\" a Negro spiritual written by J.

It was directed by Vyesolod Pudovkin, a Russian chemist, who reflects the same genius for camera angles and a selection of types as S. M. Eisenstein, producer of \\"Potemkin.\\" Mr. Pudovkin has a striking faculty for pictorial expression, and while he may leap from men and machinery to the Stock Exchange and thence to the water-ridden trenches, he succeeds in Keeping to the thread of his story.The narrative is eminently satisfactory Soviet propaganda, for it shows the hardships of the proletariat and the money-mad capitalists. A few of the spectators in the upper reaches of the theatre and those behind the orchestra seats last night applauded the victorious Russian hordes, especially when the Czar's Winter Palace was supposed to be demolished. Mr. Pudovkin evinces a fondness for destructionists, for he appears to bear a grudge against works of art erected by a Czarist administration. He constantly returns in the course of this chronicle to a bronze horse, which he occasionally succeeds in picturing from an angle so that the shadow of the monument is ridiculous.In the scenes dealing with the man of money Mr. Pudovkin, in a none too gentle fashion, swings from the comforts of the financier's office to the battle zone, and he also delights in depicting the gamblers on the Stock Exchange, and then, in a fraction of a second, returning to the soldiers wallowing under fire in mud and water.This picture is interesting because of its peculiarly fine conception of camera flashes. Only a few feet, a very few, are used in some scenes and yet they are filmed so well that they make an indelible impression. The close-ups are exceptionally clever, for not only are the players singularly well suited to the rôle they act but their expressions in the gigantic close-ups are true to the mood.The story runs from before the World War to the establishment of the Soviet system. It has little to do with the latter, but it attempts to show the reason for the disapproval of Kerensky. This leader is beheld in an immense amphitheatre making one of the magnetic addresses for which he was famous.In the opening episodes there is a peasant youth, rough, clear-eyed, who comes to St. Petersburg. Before he appreciates what's happening to him he finds himself a strike-breaker. Eventually he is depicted realizing the wrong he has done to his brother workers and he decides to remedy it. He plunges into the office of the factory manager and, to the horror of the other employes, he rains blows on the man. Then, with a secretary fainting, he forges into the inner office of the capitalist, whom he treats in the same way he had the factory manager. The police arrive and the young peasant is locked up, but when war breaks out he is hauled from prison to be a fighter.Mr. Pudovkin is the producer of a film called \\"Mother,\\" and Mme. Baranowska, who figures as the peasant's mother in \\"The End of St. Petersburg,\\" also played in that previous production. Aside from her there are no professional players in this current offering, yet, through the comprehensive direction, the persons who act the different parts are true to life in their actions and expressions. In fact one feels sometimes as though this film were a remarkable news reel of the Russian Revolution.The cinematic effort is accompanied by a most useful musical score with excellent effects.

The extended minuet of this diehard duo will surely play in euphoria. The President's decision to go it alone - one-on-one for more than four hours - was Rooseveltian in its audacity (and its arrogance). True, we elect one man and trust him, but sometimes personal diplomacy goes too far, and Mr. Gorbachev should be reminded that no understandings reached man-to-man count beyond Jan. 20, 1989. 2.

Was a breakthrough achieved in arms control? Of course not; although this is written while statements are being drafted, it appears that Mr. Reagan refused to accept this Soviet criterion for success in this resumption of normal relations after their long snit. 4. Did we get into the agreement-signing, summitary habit?

An influential reporter for one of the nation's most prestigious newspapers -- The Wall Street Journal -- is accused by the Securities and Exchange Commission of profiting from information ''misappropriated'' from his employer.  The S.E.C. complaint filed this month weaves a tale of intrigue involving wealthy accomplices, a Swiss bank account and false invoices -- charges that have made the actions of the reporter, R. Foster Winans, a matter of scrutiny in both financial and journalistic circles.  The Winans action, more stunning than routine S.E.C. filings, is the latest in a string of dramatic cases flowing from the agency's attempt to stretch the definition of illegal insider trading into new and uncharted terrain.   Insider trading has in fact become the hallmark of the tenure of John S.R. Shad, the 60-year-old former vice chairman of E.F. Hutton, who became the nation's 22d S.E.C. chairman in 1981.  At the outset, Mr. Shad promised to ''comedown on insider trading with hobnail boots.''   And he has.  Of the 77 insider trading actions brought by the S.E.C. since 1949, a total of 55 were brought under Mr. Shad.  These cases are notable not only because of sheer volume, but because they contain the seeds of a major broadening in the meaning of insider trading that could influence behavior on Wall Street and its tributaries for years to come.

After a furious public outcry, six police officers were tried on criminal charges and acquitted.    A quasi docudrama that interweaves the testimony of family members, a police officer, witnesses, a television newswoman and a lawyer, with scenes of domestic conflict, \\"Life During Wartime\\" examines the fictional case of a graffiti writer named Daryl Cummings who dies in circumstances similar to Stewart's. Although the play expresses little doubt that Daryl was beaten to death, it isn't as concerned with proclaiming criminal guilt as with exploring the social and familial tensions that turn Daryl into a larger-than-life symbol.

Those sort of textures are hard to pull off onstage, and for the first handful of songs at the Bottom Line, taken from the album, the band sounded a bit unsure of itself. The band's saxophonist and keyboardist, Steve Berlin, played samples from his keyboards to get some of the sound, whether it be a tricky percussion part or a gauzy texture, and the band was forced to accommodate the technology, which seemed a bit invasive.

According to the Spanish coroner's report, Mr. Maxwell died of a heart attack, not drowning. But there was no way to tell whether he was stricken and fell overboard, or if his heart gave out when he hit the water -- from a fall or a jump.    Less ambiguous is the autopsy of the bankrupt Maxwell empire. It became clear last week that at the time of his death, Mr. Maxwell had financial problems that might have driven a man to suicide, or put a fatal strain on a failing heart. The picture that is emerging is of a desperate shell game in which millions of dollars in borrowed money was shifted from one part of the empire to prop up another. Money was taken from pension funds","excerpt":"the same collateral was pledged for more than one loan.

Born 100 years ago this Tuesday, Klemperer began his career as a protege of Mahler and Hans Pfitzner, conducted first performances of works by Schoenberg and Stravinsky, and, in his last years, took great interest in the latest syntactic innovations of Pierre Boulez and Karlheinz Stockhausen. He made his first records in 1924 (dim, acoustic 78's of works by Beethoven, Bruckner and Schubert) and his last in the early 1970's, nearly 50 years later, in an era of stereo spectaculars.

Despite such pleasures, however, most of us read \\"The Pushcart Prize\\" for the fiction, and here the news is particularly good. Writers seem to be willing to explore larger territory than they have in previous years; in Joseph Geha's \\"Through and Through,\\" even God Himself suggests this tactic to a hit man on the lam: \\"Do not blow town, My child.

It failed that last test miserably.   Yesterday's meeting between Mr. Reagan and Chancellor Schmidt, despite efforts to paper over cracks in the wall, dramatized their differences on how to respond to the crisis - and how to prevent it from wrecking the Western alliance.   Mr. Reagan, holding the Soviet Union responsible for the military crackdown on the Poles, has imposed sanctions on the Soviet Union.  But Mr. Schmidt, asserting that Moscow was not the prime mover against Poland, wants to take a less aggressive line - one that will permit German trade with the Russians to continue. This dispute long antedates the Polish crisis. At the Ottawa summit conference last July, a principal fight between the American and German leaders was over the export of high technology to the Russians, as well as over the planned Siberian natural gas pipeline to supply West Germany and other European countries.

And to attain what he promised -- national unity, martial glory and trains running like clockwork -- Mussolini honed the skills of a journalist, actor and impresario.

Both emphasize how far Japanese jazz has come from the years after World War II when that country's musicians were influenced by American names and styles: Fumio Nanri was ''the Louis Armstrong of Japan,'' Shoji Suzuki was ''the Benny Goodman of Japan,'' and a singer, whose real name was Kiyoko Maruyama, covered a lot of territory by calling herself Ella Vaughan.   Tying in with the designation of next week as ''Tokyo Week in New York,'' celebrating the 25th Sister City Anniversary between the two cities, the pianist Billy Taylor will produce a concert at Avery Fisher Hall on behalf of Jazzmobile on June 13 that will bring together nine outstanding Japanese jazz musicians and nine Americans.

Another voice joined the chorus, somebody in the band picked up a cowbell and added a new percussion figure, and suddenly the group reached the level all great dance bands have to reach to make a living. What had been eight men working became a unit willing to turn the communal experience into something transcendental, to use physical movement and music's sensuality as a release from the mundane.   The song, \\"The Peanut Vendor,\\" ended up being an Afro-Cuban suite. It started out smoothly, with Hiram Remon singing almost introspectively. Figures and rhythmic riffs were added. The performance changed mood, picking up the gravity of a great groove, and as it hit the improvisation section, the band blossomed. Lewis Kahn on violin improvised first, then turned the last few notes of his solo into a riff that was picked up by the rest of the band","excerpt":"the saxophonist Gene Jefferson improvised next.

But New York City suffers from a chronic deficiency of jazz in the outdoors, despite the welcome ministrations of the City Parks Foundation. And the Caramoor Jazz Festival, about 50 miles northeast in Katonah, N.Y., offers a concert setting lovelier and more serene than you'll find within New York City limits. (Happily, it also offers a shuttle bus.) The festival is now in its 13th season, and while it still lacks the cachet of Caramoor's more established classical festivals, its lineup -- spread over two Saturdays, tomorrow and Aug. 5 -- reflects some smart and generous thinking. This is the work of Jim Luce, the event's producer for more than a decade, and the saxophonist Joe Lovano, who has ably served as artistic director since 2003.

The fact that it is all in German need not dismay anybody, for the action is easily understandable, particularly after a perusal of the synopsis on the program of the Fifty-fifth Street Playhouse, where this film is on exhibition. This contribution is known as \\"Zwei Hertzen in Drei-Viertel Takt\\" and by the English title of \\"Two Hearts in Waltz-Time.\\"In making this vocalized film the Germans have outdone themselves in all its departments. The Tobis sound recording is of excellent quality, the acting is buoyant, the comedy is restrained, the characters are cleverly defined and the suspense is sustained until the last few moments. In its line it has no rivals and it is an entertainment that can be enjoyed by the most exacting of persons. It is a picture with a soul, for often there are true poetic touches which come and go in a pleasing, un-assuming manner. Geza von Bolvary is responsible for the direction","excerpt":"the scenario is the work of Walter Reich and Fritz Schulz, and Robert Stolz is credited with the music and the direction of his compositions.The little Fifty-fifth Street Playhouse was packed with Germans yesterday afternoon, as sunny an October day as it was, and the presumption is that many in the gathering had heard from the father-land of this film. They laughed and enjoyed the music and the tuneful melodies as they evidently almost forgot that the singing came from the mere shadows of the performers.Herr von Bolvary has not permitted any stereotyped motion-picture ideas to interfere with the telling of his story. Yet he succeeds in giving a beguiling romance. He has taken his time in filming this tale and a last-minute punctilious character pops up to delay the deénouement. The nature of this individual is set forth so ably that he serves the operetta well.The initial scenes in this fascinating musical narrative are not of 1930 but of 1818, with Franz Schubert at his piano as he is inspired to compose a waltz. As he strikes the keys of the instrument the notes are heard by a variety of persons who join in the melody. Soon the time changes by the simple showing of \\"1930,\\" and one perceives two brothers, Nicky and Vicky Mahler, librettists. Their characteristics — their wrangling and their enthusiasm for their work is a source of mirth. Soon they have written the libretto of an operetta, known as \\"Zwei Hertzen in Drei-Viertal Takt.\\" Toni Hofer composes the music, but he fails to get an inspiration for a waltz, and as one or two of the persons involved say: \\"Who has ever heard of a Viennese operetta without a waltz?\\"Toni is quite a Don Juan and Nicky and Vicky are not anxious to have their sister, Hedi, a great admirer of Toni's compositions, meet him. So far as the music master is concerned, the operetta will have to be presented without a waltz. He invites thirty guests to a dinner, but Nicky and Vicky, anxious to have the composer work on the operetta and if possible write the music for a waltz, secretly cancel all the invitations by telephone. On the night of the dinner, however, Hedi travels in a sleigh to Toni's home, and she tells Toni that none of his guests will appear. He is rather gratified on beholding the beauteous Hedi, and after dinner he goes to the piano, which he strums, and finally a lovely waltz is composed.But while he is playing the enchanting music Hedi slips away and Toni follows her, but the sleigh has sped away. A little later the brothers come to Toni's abode and he surprises them by saying that he has composed the much-wanted waltz. When he sits down to play it over, however, he cannot remember it. Toni is unaware that the ravishing blonde who inspired the waltz is the sister of the librettists, and so are they.There are rehearsals, but no waltz. The producer cannot imagine why any composer once having had the lilt of a waltz in his head did not put it down on paper. But in a nice, easy fashion all is set right and Toni, a man with gray hair on his temples, not only is rewarded in the end with his waltz, but also with the muse, who in this case is Hedi.The cast is eminently suitable. Walter Janssen is splendid as Toni. Oscar Karlweiss and Willy Forst are most amusing as the two brothers. Gretl Theimer is gracious and sings well in the rôle of Hedi. Irene Wisinger also adds to the thrilling in this film. Szoeke Szakall makes a natural and always interesting producer. In fact, there is no fault to find with the interpretation of any of the rôles.

Mrs. Reid impersonates Joan Allen, the mother who pets and pampers her boy, flinging aside the common-sense ideas offered by her husband. Mrs. Reid gives a fine performance from the first chapter, in which she refuses to permit the father to thrash the obstreperous and impudent child, to the last, in which she pleads with the Judge and jury to go to prison instead of the son, who has killed an old woman with his automobile.Although he has to play the part of an incorrigible boy of 8. Pat Moore as Bobby adds considerably to the story by his acting. He is natural both in antics and expression. In the first sequence he misbehaves himself on Christmas Eve and his father punishes him by locking him in a room. Bobby however, escapes and for a time enjoys himself in another home where his parents are guests. He is the sort of precocious child who is proud of the fact that he has discovered that there is no Santa Claus. Little Jane Wray is cast as Patsy Heath, who is the same age as Bobby. She insists on believing in Santa Claus, but delights in emulating her mother in putting rouge on her lips. Bobby empties the dregs of whisky from a flask and gives it to Patsy, which fact is discovered by her father, played by Percy Marmont.Arthur Rankin appears as Bobby eight years later. His father has died and his mother spoils him more than ever. She presents him with an automobile and on the day he receives it he is arrested for speeding. Joan manages to use her influence to make it merely a matter of fine in spite of the recommendation of the policeman that the offender be sent to jail.Drinking and speeding are the laws that are broken. Bobby's last escapade is when he crashes into a vegetable cart when racing in his car away from a motorcycle policeman. An old woman is killed and the boy is arrested and eventually convicted of manslaugher.Mr. Marmont has a minor rôle in this production, which is largely devoted to the indulgent mother and the selfish, spiteful son. The story carries a moral and is quite intertaining.

They ride together for a while, singing, and then Vitaly pulls off into a deserted area and kills the child for no apparent reason.   Possibly more shocking than the crime is the fact that Vitaly next goes to discuss it with his grandfather, who has been a party to Vitaly's plans. Since kidnapping was the real motive, and since the little girl was the daughter of Vitaly's married lover Alyona (Svetlana Bragarnik), the grandfather understandably questions the extreme nature of Vitaly's act. Had he been in Vitaly's place, he says casually, he would only have kidnapped the child and hidden her in a shed.   \\"Satan\\" divides itself between the particulars of Vitaly's unsettled existence and the extreme anguish of Alyona, whose unspecified job makes her something of a Soviet V.I.P. Vitaly's nominal reason for devising his scheme has been to extort some of the cash Alyona keeps hidden in her relatively comfortable apartment. Vitaly himself lives as a boarder with a number of other people in a crowded, grimy household where there are clusters of empty liquor bottles beside mattresses on the floor. A drifter, he has been dismissed from many jobs and makes his chief occupation the manipulation and exploitation of friends.   Vitaly's behavior is carefully placed within the context of a society coming apart at the seams. Although Vitaly is the film's nominal center, Alyona becomes an equally compelling figure, thanks to Miss Bragarnik's fierce and commanding performance","excerpt":"the scenes depicting her grief are almost unbearably painful to watch. \\"Satan\\" arrives at a remarkable resolution in a sequence that finds Alyona seeing her lover Vitaly for the first time during the story and telling him about her daughter's abduction. As she goes on, she begins to realize that she is speaking to her child's killer.

Indeed, I was in good condition, for I had been slapping and pinching myself for an hour, trying to keep awake to the realization that what I was seeing on the screen was actually there.For, believe me, this mawkish drama about a fellow who is jealous toward his wife and only comes to appreciate her spotless virtue when he is shipwrecked in the sea and facing death is one of the most ineffectual and incredible films I've ever faced, particularly from people as respectable as the ones who fashioned it.Michael Cacoyannis, its director, is the agile young fellow who made the brilliant Greek film, \\"Electra,\\" which was one of the joys of last winter. And Frederic Wakeman, who collaborated with Mr. Cacoyannis on the script, is the author of \\"Shore Leave,\\" \\"The Hucksters\\" and the novel on which this film is based.

A highly regarded member of the Los Angeles legal community, he became active on behalf of The Hebrew University by spearheading the growth of AFHU's activities in California and throughout the West coast. Assuming a series of key leadership roles within American Friends, he served as Chairman of the Board of the Western States Region from the mid 1980s. He performed equally valuable leadership functions as the Chairman of AFHU's Board of Directors and as Deputy Chairman of the Hebrew University International Board of Governors. A tireless proponent of the University, Harvey personally brought delegations of supporters to Israel and encouraged their contributions to, and awareness of, activities in major disciplines. Harvey and Lillian became Benefactors of The Hebrew University in 1990. Their numerous and far-sighted contributions over the decades enhanced the University's physical and intellectual growth and will benefit Israel's people and humanity in general for generations to come. The Silbert's generosity led to the establishment of vital facilities on the Mt. Scopus campus, including The Harvey L. Silbert Center for Israeli Studies, a multidisciplinary think tank for eminent scholars and experts in public affairs. Harvey initiated funding for the Lillian and Harvey L. Silbert Humanities Building, a rich cultural reservoir of educational resources and the creation of the Silbert Wing at Hebrew University's Louis Boyar Building, housing the Rothberg International School. He and Lillian established the beautiful Lilliian Silbert Garden on the Mt. Scopus campus. Committed to helping the University achieve academic advances in diverse fields, he worked to establish the Avraham Harman Chair in Modern Jewish History and was the driving force behind the Harman Special Fund and the Bernard Cherrick Center for the Study of Zionism. He was a major contributor to the Sinatra International Student Center and the Streisand Building for Jewish Studies. Harvey Silbert was admired by all those who knew him, including Israel's top leaders in government, diplomacy and academia.

His rugged good looks and easy-going charm have contributed mightily to weekly series, most notably \\"The Rockford Files,\\" and quality television movies, the most recent being \\"Decoration Day.\\" Mr. Garner is an old-fashioned star, his fine performances always conveying something of his own integrity.    And now the bad news. Somehow Mr. Garner was persuaded to return to series television in \\"Man of the People,\\" having its premiere on NBC at 8 Sunday evening. He plays Jim Doyle, a self-described small-time grifter, once married to a city councilwoman and now content to spend most of his time placing horse bets and hustling innocents in pool halls. When his former wife dies, Doyle is appointed to fill her seat by the mischievous Mayor Lisbeth Chardin (Kate Mulgrew). The cocky Doyle, looking forward to a chauffeured limousine, sets up shop in the blue-collar district, much to the horror of Constance (Corinne Bohrer), the devoted staff member of Doyle's late wife. The situation: devil-may-care Doyle in predictable combat with disapproving Constance.    The most immediate problem is that Mr. Garner is at least 15 years too old for the role. His disarming rogue is a touch creaky in the joints, and dyed eyebrows, no matter how carefully trimmed, are anything but flattering. Mr. Garner's disarmingly direct style of reading a line can still do wonders for distressingly ordinary dialogue, but there's little he can do about a flat concept. Doyle gets to play his little scams -- nailing a pompous sucker in a card game, deflating a hotshot realtor with an elaborate con game -- but the rogue keeps ending up looking considerably more tired than irrepressible. Some of his best moments are played off against his streetwise secretary, Rita (Romy Walthall), a Madonna fan.    The first three episodes of \\"Man of the People\\" add up to little more than mildly amusing trifles. Mr. Garner needs far heftier material if he expects to survive against Angela Lansbury in \\"Murder, She Wrote\\" on CBS. Another distinguished acting veteran, Ms. Lansbury was considerably more shrewd in selecting a late-career annuity vehicle. 'Nurses'  NBC Tomorrow at 9:30 P.M.   The makers of \\"Empty Nest,\\" Witt/Thomas/Harris Productions, now offer another weekly series set in the same Miami medical complex. This one revolves, as you might expect, around a nurses station and its core team of dedicated workers. There's the sarcastic divorcee, the fretting mother, and so forth. Nothing much new in the concept, but the show was created by Susan Harris (\\"Soap,\\" \\"Golden Girls\\"), a very clever and funny woman. Keep an eye on Jeff Altman as the nurse with a compulsion to insult doctors, and Mary Jo Keenan as the rookie riddled with phobias.  'Miss America Pageant'  NBC Tomorrow at 10 P.M.    Sexist relic? Not anymore, promise the producers. Being brought on as hosts for the first time are Regis Philbin and Kathie Lee Gifford, daytime talk mavens, who insist that they are out to have a little fun. Leonard Horn, the executive producer, talks of an effort to \\"get behind the makeup and hairdos, to let the public see what the judges have seen, rather than simply emphasizing physical attractiveness and talent.\\" The swimsuit parade, however, is still a part of the pageant and will now be presented as a production number. Some things in show business are sacred.  'Billy Connolly: Pale Blue Scottish Person' HBO Tomorrow at 11 P.M.    Long popular in England, Ireland, Canada and Australia, Billy Connolly emerged promisingly on the United States scene in the waning episodes of the series \\"Head of the Class.\\" Then he did a forgettable HBO comedy special with Whoopi Goldberg. He bounces back confidently on this solo outing, taking bawdy swipes at everything from folk singers to critics to HBO. The title is plucked from his musings on skin tone: \\"I'm not white, I'm pale blue. The Irish run pinkish","excerpt":"the Scottist are more powder blue.\\" That's one of his printable quotes.

THE SCREEN","excerpt":"THE SCREEN"},{"year":"1945","title":"Again the Swiss nave sent us a vivid and honest film which mirrors a bit of the anguish and courage of certain peoples in Europe during the war. The title of it is \\"The Last Chance,\\" and it opened at Loew's Criterion yesterday. On the whole, it must be acknowledged as one of the best films of World War II to date.For the story told by this picture is a straight and believable account of genuine heroism in the face of tremendous odds. It is a story of man's love of freedom and his regard for his fellow man. And it is also a tense, exciting drama based substantially on documented facts.It tells of two Allied prisoners, a Britisher and an American, who escape from a train in northern Italy, make their way toward the Swiss frontier and, just a few miles from their objective, become involved in a vital enterprise. For there, in a small Italian village—and through the offices of a daring priest—they fall in with another British officer and a group of refugees determined to get to Switzerland.The hope of the fugitives is that a trained guide will lead them through the perilous Alpine pass, but they discover on reaching his village at the foot of the Alps that the Nazis have killed him. And so, with several deserted orphans from the village, they push on into the pass, supported only by their spirits and by the ingenuity of the three soldiers.Moving slowly, in its early phases, the picture gains momentum and suspense—and particularly human dignity—as it reaches its dramatic climax. The whole visual structure of the story of the painful, courageous struggle through the Alps, including a most vivid incident in a small rest hut near the end, makes as moving and absorbing a cinema episode as we have experienced in some time.Plainly, the directness and simplicity of the semi-documentary account, the sharp photographic fidelity and the honesty of performance of the cast—some members of which were recruited from untrained actors—are responsible elements. John Hoy and E. G. Morrison are excellent as the British officers and Ray Reagan, an American airman who was interned in Switzerland, represents his country well. Romano Calo is particularly notable as the priest among the cast of characters, which embraces many types and nationalities. English, Italian and a bit of German and French are spoken naturally throughout the picture—which heightens the verisimilitude.Lazar Wechsler produced this film in Switzerland against the natural, impressive background of mountains and Piedmont country. He deserves commendation and thanks from those who delight in seeing pictures truthfully and earnestly made. An Absorbing Episode","excerpt":"THE SCREEN"},{"year":"1930","title":"The second German-produced talking film to be exhibited in this country is \\"Why Cry at Parting,\\" a farce adapted from Hugo Hirsch's musical comedy, \\"Wer Wird Denn Weinen, Wenn Mann Auseinandergeht.\\" It is now at the Fifth Avenue Playhouse, The voices are not particularly well synchronized, a defect which may be due to the apparatus in the theatre. The tonal quality is invariably natural, but the speech impresses one as being delivered from a distance and then being amplified. It is muffled.Sometimes it is difficult to decide who is talking and the male voices are unusually high pitched. The singing in one episode is better recorded than the talking.The film story afforded a good deal of fun to an audience yesterday afternoon, but most of the laughter was occasioned by bits of buffoonery. The incidents may be ingenuous in their development, but they are not endowed with much brightness.Most of the hardy comedy falls to the lot of Dina Gralla, who impersonates a girl detective who is pursuing Frank Western. This Western disappears on the eve of his marriage and there seems to be some doubt as to whether he has taken the bridal dot, some 250,000 marks, with him. Sybil Werner, the female sleuth, takes a long time to decide whether or no Mr. Western is innocent, and in trying to find it out she places herself in both awkward and compromising predicaments.The hectic happenings take place in Berlin, Southampton, Paris and London. It is rather strange to hear a British bobby talking German and likewise some of the persons in the Paris scenes. A few words of French are sputtered, but the tale is carried on in German.During one of the scenes Sybil is hiding in a bathtub aboard a steamship when the occupant of the suite turns on the water. Sybil then pretends that through this accident she has caught cold and keeps the slapstick variety of fun going.The picture itself is much too long. It lasts for almost an hour and a half.

If anything, this veteran villain of the screen out-Casey's Casey, for this actor not only ignores any but the third offering from the pitcher, but he is wont, during his Mudville career, to bring with him to the plate a bottle of beer and to use only one hand in knocking the ball over the fence or into the grand stand.Casey, in this picture, is a junkman, who is referred to as an idler six days of the week and an idol on the seventh. He is not exactly modest about his slugging ability, and apparently does quite enough to put his rival players on edge. When he is asked to play for the Giants, he is told:\\"Pack up your other suit. Big Boy, New York's paging you. You'll forget Tanktown Tillie when you see the Broadway beauties.\\"The producers have fathomed a way to meet the demands for a happy ending and at the same time to give an idea of Casey's fall from grace—when he strikes out. There is a reason for Casey's failure, and where he had met the cold shoulder he eventually wins a hero's laurels. It is understood that there is to be another game, which it is not thought necessary to show on the screen, for it is a foregone conclusion that the mighty Casey will triumph.Some faint idea of the type of fun in this hilarious affair can be gathered from the fact that in the first chapter Casey is in danger of losing his trousers, and subsequently he becomes entangled with a slab of limburger cheese.The evil genius of this comedy is portrayed by none other than Ford Sterling, who, with a series of beards as disguises, keeps the humor at its normal level. Mr. Beery, himself, also takes a turn or two at a beard, which was obviously appreciated by a contingent of the spectators.Little did Mr. Thayer imagine when he penned his memorable rhyme that it would appear in animated shadow form as being supervised by Hector Turnbull, directed by Monte Brice, written by Mr. Turnbull, adapted by Reginald Morris and Mr. Brice","excerpt":"the screen play worked out by Jules Furthman, and costumes, titles and scenic effects by three other experts.The background of this diversion is that of the diffident Nineties, with the fair sex in trailing skirts, their hair in knots, to which hats were dexterously pinned. One of the first horseless vehicles is perceived worming its way among the horse-drawn buggies and buckboards.Mr. Beery clings closely to the character; his mental anguish as Casey is portrayed by his lower jaw slowly moving from side to side. Mr. Sterling does his share as a foil for Mr. Beery, and Zazu Pitts is clever as the Mudville beauty in the days when a schooner of beer could be bought for a nickel.As a contrast to this lively sketch, John Murray Anderson has devised a beautiful stage offering heralded as \\"Memory's Garden,\\" inspired by Marcus Stone's paintings of English gardens.A short scenic subject, called \\"The Yellow Dog,\\" contains some lovely landscapes.

(This place has the true look, incidentally, of Oxford, Miss., the home town of William Faulkner, whose novel \\"The Hamlet\\" and several short stories are the basis for this film.)And, in no time at all, this young roughneck is working himself into the favor and the home of a local tyrant whose greed is gargantuan and who has a sensitive, scornful daughter and a weakling son. He is riling the blood of the unwed daughter and breathing hard on the neck of the futile son, while the old man encourages this aggression. It is a \\"hot tin roof\\" set-up, for sure.What's more, the whole show, in natural settings shot in color and CinemaScope, has the look and the atmospheric feeling of an afternoon storm making up above the still trees and sun-cracked buildings of a quiet Southern town on a hot day.Irving Ravetch and Harriet Frank Jr. have developed a tight, word-crackling script that lines up the bitter situation in quick scenes and slashing dialogue. Martin Ritt has directed for tension—for scornful, sarcastic attitudes on the part of the principal contenders. And those roles are effectively played.Paul Newman is best as the roughneck who moves in with a thinly veiled sneer to knock down the younger generation and make himself the inheritor of the old man. He has within his plowhand figure and behind his hard blue eyes the deep and ugly deceptions of a neo-Huey Long. He could, if the script would let him, develop a classic character.Joanne Woodward is also excellent as the independent daughter who snarls not only at the arrogant intruder but likewise at her bluff, uncouth old man. And Orson Welles, so help us, does a pretty good hard-hitting job making a shrewd, fierce and bloated vulgarian of this small-town tycoon. He even puts on a Southern accent that you can hardly understand.Anthony Franciosa is somewhat miscast as a weakling son of the South and so is Richard Anderson as a puny Mississippi mama's-boy. But Lee Remick fills the bill precisely as a beautiful but dumb young wife (to Mr. Franciosa's giggling husband) and Angela Lansbury makes a good fleshy old doll.They're all clicking nicely, as we've noted, when suddenly the script takes a plunge from its level of hard, ruthless logic into sheer story-telling make-believe. The writers, who have kept their characters ice-cold in the midst of the summer heat, turn around in the flutter of an eyelash and make them melodramatic, magnanimous and warm. Before you know it, this pack of little foxes becomes as romantic as doves. It all ends with them all settling down to raise babies and love their homes.There are those who would like to rate this picture, produced by Jerry Wald for Twentieth Century-Fox, alongside that same producer's (and studio's) \\"Peyton Place.\\" Both of them tell stories of tensions in American towns. There is one noticeable difference. \\"Peyton Place\\" started weakly and got strong. \\"The Long, Hot Summer\\" starts superbly and ends in a senseless, flabby heap.

Wearing a pale blue button-down shirt open at the neck -- pale blue was certainly his color -- Carter's presence had a quintessential American cleanliness, that silvery light of a finely tuned and supple rectitude  that produces our best ministers and generals alike, responsible for both the bogs of Vietnam and the vision of a nobler justice. But then it was not hard to see that if Carter got elected, there would be cliques of Carter-watchers among the press, for his personality had delicate shifts that suggested much. Last night, on the charter flight coming back to Georgia from West Virginia, Mailer had been conducted to the front of the press plane to meet the candidate  and his wife Rosalynn (pronounced ROSE-lyn) and that had been an agreeable adrenaline, as if one had moved into a new suburban neighborhood and been invited to one's first barbecue and the host was Jimmy Carter -- \\"I've been looking forward to meeting you,\\" he says -- a friendly fellow you couldn't size  up instantly. He had to have ability because he was running the biggest corporate operation in town, yet there he was, as ordinary as yourself, except for a keenness of response, an alertness in his attention that was not at all ordinary, yes, somebody you instantly wanted to know better. . . .

The other day at the White House, the latest Nobel laureate in economics, Prof. George Stigler of the University of Chicago, told a news conference that the United States was in a depression. When the reporters gasped, Mr. Stigler said he could call it a recession if they preferred, but the press corps, eager for a story, shouted, ''No, no,'' and Mr. Stigler let ''depression'' stand, to the discomfiture of the White House, which had thought Mr. Stigler was on its side.

It won't be easy to find the money in one chunk. Just raising $12 billion for the fiscal year 1984, which begins next Oct. 1, is difficult because of the short time remaining and the fact that much of the revenue from politically feasible items, such as greater taxpayer compliance, would not be collected until 1985.

Mr. Epstein is critical of the film's transformation of the heavy frigate that Captain Aubrey and his crew pursue from an American into a French ship, but the movie is by necessity a melding of several of O'Brian's novels, and the French are the dominant enemy throughout the series. More important, Mr. Epstein feels the characters of Jack Aubrey and his ship's doctor, Stephen Maturin, are slighted. But the immensely satisfying deepening of that friendship takes place over the course of 20 books, and the filmmakers had only a couple of hours to suggest it. Paul Bettany's Maturin is, to be sure, a more handsome figure than the scruffy creature introduced by O'Brian, but his brilliance and cranky generosity of spirit, and Jack's combination of occasional buffoonery and ship-handling genius, are always at the heart of this film.

Visually, it is erratic, with moments of great force and others of considerable silliness. Dramatically, it is weightless. Politically, it is schizophrenic. The libertarian points made in the first hour, when the Electra legend is retold, are lopped off in a mushy 15-minute coda that has the effect of an ideological sales tax.With a muddy plain, and horsemen wheeling and maneuvering in the background, Mr. Jancso produces a stripped-down \\"Electra,\\" in the sense that there is virtually no scenery besides the plain itself and a brick barn, and virtually no props. Also in the sense that many of the figures who mime the chorus wear no clothes.Electra, played with windblown fierceness but not much effect by Mari Torocsik, is held in unwilling subjection by Aegisthus, who has killed her father, Agamemnon. She strides about reproaching Aegisthus for his bloody rule and warning him that her brother, Orestes, will come and kill him.Aegisthus, whose portrayal by Jozsef Madaras is the one dramatic strength of the film, speaks of the need of rulers to be harsh, asserts that people live better under fear and blames Agamemnon for confusing his subjects by giving them freedom.Perhaps the boldest bit of political satire, in a film made under Hungarian state auspices, comes in the scene of a feast day when Aegisthus's subjects, normally herded about by black-garbed men with whips, are entitled to speak freely.\\"My wife bore me three sons this year,\\" one man says.\\"Money was worth twice as much \\"this year,\\" says another.\\"This year I had good dream,\\" says a third.Mr. Jancso brings tragic tension to several confrontation scenes: the first between the prisoner Electra and the tyrant Aegisthus","excerpt":"the second between Orestes and the tyrant he has overthrown. In each case the dialogue proceeds while the weaker person advances instead of retreating, and the stronger one retreats instead of advancing. It is a bold reversal, and works brilliantly.Orestes shoots Aegisthus with a pistol, and he and Electra walk off. It would be kind to suppose that Mr. Jansco has walked off too. In any event, somebody left the camera running for another quarter of an hour.Orestes and Electra shoot each other, fall dead, get up again, climb into a red helicopter. This hovers overhead while a voice tells about a firebird that gives the working classes strength and hope. The movie peters on out with masses of people dancing and the voice droning such phrases as: \\"Tomorrow is a new day,\\" \\"A new world starts at last\\" and \\"Perhaps this, our great creed, shall someday be realized.\\"It is as if somebody had poured a great deal of water into a small and never very robust soup.

The Paine Webber Art Gallery's \\"Up River: Selections From the Hudson River Museum of Westchester\\" offers paintings and drawings from a collection whose home is a Victorian mansion 20 miles north of New York City, and \\"The Century Association: American Masters and Masterworks\\" at the New-York Historical Society is the first-ever public exhibition of paintings and sculptures from one of the city's venerable private collections.   The Century Association's show is by far the more interesting of the two because of the high percentage of exceptional works as well as the historical cachet of the club (the renovation of its 1891 landmark premises on 43d Street in mid-Manhattan was the pretext for the loan of these works). Founded in 1847 as a private club, the Century's early members included a who's who of Hudson River School painters, such as Jasper Cropsey, John Frederick Kensett, Sanford Gifford and Asher B. Durand. The price of membership was often paid in the form of a painting, as in the case of Albert Bierstadt's remarkable scene of Union soldiers firing on Confederate forces, and the collection expanded through bequests, commissions and purchases made to bail out financially distressed members.   Among the first-rate pieces here are two very different landscapes by Durand. Perhaps the chief esthetician of mid-19th-century American art, he spoke of painting as a way of arriving at the essential \\"reality\\" of nature. In the gray, claustrophobic \\"Bash-Bish Falls,\\" he seems to be trying to simulate physically the textures of rock and water through a subtle use of stippling. \\"Kaaterskill Clove,\\" a view of the Catskills, is by contrast one of those wide-open, dreamy American panoramas that seem, without ever losing a sense of place, to be spun entirely of light and mist. The underlying reality here is spiritual: nature, as Durand put it in an essay, \\"fraught with high and holy meaning.\\"    This quasi-religious approach is somewhat toned down in Kensett's \\"Mount Chocorua,\\" whose sun-warmed, inhabited New Hampshire valley radiates a secular domestic peace. And while Worthington Whittredge's \\"Crossing the Ford, Platte River, Colorado\\" is similarly tranquil, it also introduces reality of another kind. The figures living along the river are American Indians whose depiction in 19th-century art, no matter how sympathetic, cannot help but strike a disturbing note for the modern viewer. Even in Whittredge's lovely, reflective work, their presence is a reminder of the human histories, rich and often troubled, that American painting tended to pass over in its single-minded reach for the sublime.   Some of those histories do turn up in portraiture, and the Century collection holds some memorable images: an inscrutable, dogelike William Cullen Bryant by Durand (now dim and in need of cleaning, like several other paintings in the collection), John Singer Sargent's disarming and ill-fated Frank O'Meara, and John La Farge's profile likeness of a pensive 19-year-old Henry James.   It is worth noting that Durand's portraits of American Presidents are on view in the Historical Society's own Lumen Reed collection upstairs, as are superb genre paintings by William Sidney Mount, an artist whose populist subjects tend to obscure the fact that his touch and his compositional brilliance were unsurpassed among his peers. His scene of two farmers bargaining for a horse is a marvel of interlocking geometry in which every vertical -- in the figures, the landscape and the architecture -- is just a hair off plumb, giving the whole picture a barely perceptible sway. (It was Mount's great \\"Power of Music\\" that was sold by the Century to the Cleveland Museum of Art last year.)   Finally, though the Century collection has its share of routine practitioners, it is refreshing to find painters who are seldom seen but repay attention. Among them may be counted Homer Martin, John Bunyon Bristol and Jervis McEntee, whose charming, closely worked autumn landscapes are a cross between Corot and Cropsey.   As it happens, McEntee and Cropsey are among the high points of the \\"Up River\\" show. The first is represented by an exquisite little pencil drawing of bare, attenuated trees","excerpt":"the second by \\"The Narrows at Lake George,\\" a landscape whose apparently unfinished state permits a firsthand glimpse at this artist's virtuosic technique. The show itself, however, is often disappointing. The paintings look to be in the bloom of conservatorial health and are cleanly presented in alcoves that line either side of Paine Webber's lobby, but they are, on the whole, minor in stature, and in the absence of any overarching theme that might give them point, make for a sleepy exhibition.   An exception to this is the show's earliest work, a set of six large, hand-colored engravings with pictures and texts of scenic locations in the Hudson Valley like the New Jersey Palisades and West Point. Engraved by the English-born John Hill, the \\"Hudson River Portfolio\\" was issued between 1821 and 1825, predating the Hudson River School. The topographical images are of mild documentary interest, but it is the texts that fascinate. An image of the bucolic riverside village of Fishkill is accompanied by a real-estate agent's hard sell: \\"There is the spirit of enterprise traversing this great state . . . a wide field for industry.\\" One could almost hear the ax felling the wilderness, the ghostly sound of which haunted Thomas Cole two decades later.   \\"Up River\\" makes a vague gesture toward exploring this theme of human intervention in nature, but doesn't carry it through. The title of the second half of the show, \\"Man's Influence,\\" is really only a pretext for including marine paintings and urban scenes. It is of some interest to see the hand of the folk artist emerge in a surreal-looking view of Yonkers by George Burnham in 1858, but this influence is quickly submerged when the European Barbizon and Impressionist styles make their appearance, culminating in a version of an image the show began with, the Palisades, now painted in winter as a fabric of slashed white and blue pigment.    Throughout the show there are outstanding individual moments -- Samuel Colman's lovely \\"Looking North From Ossining,\\" James Renwick Brevoort's \\"Harvest Scene With Storm Coming Up,\\" which seems saturated in a rich grass green, and Frederick W. Kost's near abstract sunset landscape of dark trees against a yellow sky -- but the story of American painting over the hundred-year span encompassed by \\"Up River\\" is a great deal more dynamic and less predictable than this exhibition suggests.      \\"The Century Association: American Masters and Masterworks\\" remains at the New-York Historical Society, 170 Central Park West, near 77th Street, through Oct. 11. \\"Up River:     Selections From the Hudson River Museum of Westchester\\" is at the Paine Webber Art Gallery, 1285 Avenue of the Americas, at 51st Street, through Oct. 2.

POP AND JAZZ GUIDE"},{"year":"1991","title":"Considering the rush of empathy for Mozart's music in this the 200th anniversary year of his death, current attitudes toward Haydn, his colleague and contemporary, have been considerably more withdrawn. The first man is spontaneously loved by millions","excerpt":"the second is admired and celebrated, but by many fewer and at a cooler temperature.   Yet in Mozart's prime, Haydn was the most famous musician in Europe. French publishers had only to affix his name to the most mediocre of compositions and sales were insured. Napoleon came near to being blown up by assassins while on his way to a performance of \\"The Creation.\\" Today Haydn retains the public's ear, but he has lost its unequivocal embrace. Why?   Andras Schiff's Haydn evening at the Metropolitan Museum on Saturday, the first of six such events following in close order, threw out a few possibilities. Most of them have to do with us, not him. One reason Mozart remains our steadfast soul mate may be this: that he is for us the first of the Romantics and we, despite the revolutions of the 20th century, are the last.   Haydn celebrated the confidence of the Enlightenment. For Mozart, man is essentially melancholic even when he is having a good time. Mozart taught that in hope there is despair. Haydn found in despair hope. Mozart began the long line of Romantic artists who had the courage to beatify personal grief. Haydn, it has been said, had the courage to be happy.     Listening to one piano sonata, two trios, a quartet and a cantata on Saturday reinforced the image of a composer amazing for his sophistication, wit and spirituality, yet one from whose wavelength modern listeners seem to have drifted. They are fascinated by the idea of a man who dressed in his best clothes before sitting down to compose, but I suspect they are bewildered by it, too.   In the slow movement of the G major Quartet (Op. 76, No. 1), the cello part made sadness sound serene; the sublime counterpoint surrounding it creates a reassuring order. The Takacs Quartet, which played better here than I have heard it in several years, had the wisdom to use little vibrato, a tool of Romanticism unsuited to Haydn's materials here. Haydn more or less invented the string quartet, and no one since has used it better. No one.   Mr. Schiff performed the late C major Piano Sonata with an eloquence that cut through the rhetoric of modern virtuoso playing. He seemed to enjoy the comic surprises of the finale as much as Haydn must have done. Besides being the pianist in the two trios (in F sharp minor and in D), Mr. Schiff also accompanied Cecilia Bartoli, the young Italian mezzo-soprano, in the solo cantata, \\"Arianna a Naxos.\\"   Next to the wonderful flamboyance of Mozart's individual vocal settings, the Haydn sounded curiously sober. There are few pyrotechnics, and in their place we find an unadorned closeness to the sense of the text. Long exposed lines are created, and this simplicity was perhaps Miss Bartoli's severest test. She handled it with admirable concentration.   Both trios have a private quality. There are no grand finales to rouse audiences; in great modesty, the music simply trails away. Yuuko Shiokawa, violinist, and Boris Pergamenschikow, cellist, were the strong string players.   The last four of these all-Haydn concerts happen tonight through Sunday evening and should not be missed.

TV: LABOR UNION PROBLEMS IN THE SUNBELT"},{"year":"1927","title":"A MODERNIZED version of J. Storer Clouston's farcical story, \\"A Lunatic at Large,\\" occupied the Hippodrome screen last week. This may be an old yarn, but it does not alter the fact that it is far fresher, or at least less stereotyped, than most of the supposedly funny efforts that emerge from photoplay studios. Hard-racked brains of gag-men often think up hilarious ideas, but whether they belong to the story is often dubious. They may be just hammered into the narrative. \\"A Lunatic at Large,\\" even without Leon Errol and his collapsible ankle and knee, would still be a good piece of humor. It has its share of suspense and it does what many pictures don't do—it keeps the spectators awake all of the time. Never for an instant do you find your mind wandering as you watch the incidents in this production, which, incidentally, also had the advantage of smart quips from Ralph Spence's pen.The first reason for the success of this production is the novel idea of the story","excerpt":"the second is Mr. Errol's clever work before the camera; the third is the direction, and the fourth, Mr. Spence's jazz epigrams.This production reveals imagination. It is true that it slumps into broad farce here and there, but those periods do not destroy what follows or what has preceded the really good stuff. Physically, Mr. Errol is uncommonly well suited to the leading rôle, that of a sl ve to three or four tramps. He soon gets away, however, from that precarious existence, when he slips a collar that is buckled around his neck, and from then on there is a good combination of suspense and comedy.The notion of a well-tailored man in a silk hat taking advantage of his chauffeur's preoccupation while replacing a punctured tire to change clothes with Sam Smith (Mr. Errol) wins steadfast attention. After the two men have transformed themselves, the owner of the limousine, who had given $100 to Smith, finds the money in the pocket of Smith's shapeless trousers, where the unimaginative Smith had put it after consenting to the deal. Smith is told that there is a letter of introduction in the breast pocket of his coat, and this communication eventually is presented by Smith to an elderly gentleman at an imposing residence. This missive reads:His Singular Dilemma.\\"He's perfectly harmless. Just give him a few bonds with which to play and he won't need anything else.\\"Smith is puzzled at the character of the place. It might be a hotel and yet it isn't. On entering one room he is struck by an individual parading up and down with his hand in his coat and a lock of hair decorating his forehead.Sam Smith has experience with various persons in the room until he decides that the sooner he can get out of the place the better. But the more he persists that he is sane, the more insistent are the powers that be in holding him as an inmate. They humor him. They watch him, and when Sam darts out of the main gate of the institution guards suddenly appear on all sides.Fun in Mid-Air.Mr. Smith, who, it must be remembered, inherits the Errolean loose knee and ankle, finds that his progress in the mansion of polished floors is impeded by the jack-knifing of his leg. He has an awful time with a statue, but not long afterward he succeeds in getting aboard an airship.Although this leviathan of the air may not be constructed on plans that would be passed by any designer, the sequences in which it figures elicit plenty of mirth. The bridge of this lighter-than-air craft is extremely commodious, and there are special levers that are supposed to send the craft up and down. It stands to reason that these gadgets should be regulated with care, hence it is not surprising that when the Errolean limb weakness causes Smith to flop against one lever, the vessel almost nose-dives in the direction of the earth, and the only thing that saves the passengers is when Mr. Smith strikes against the other lever, which immediately turns the airship's nose heavenward. The sudden inclines of the decks are employed in very much the same way as Chaplin's hilarious sequence in the log cabin of \\"The Gold Rush.\\"At one point of this production you perceive the earth some 3,000 or 4,000 feet distant, and later Sam Smith and an officer are seen hanging by a finger-clutch. Through the clever dovetailing in of actual airship scenes and those made in a studio, this stretch is shriekingly funny. When Mr. Smith decides to leave the airship by means of a parachute other genuine parachute \\"shots\\" are incorporated.The basic idea of the story has been preserved in this feature, and no senseless romance is permitted to spoil the comedy, which, as in the film transcription of \\"The Potters,\\" is something vastly in its favor. Fred Newmeyer, producer of the screen conception of \\"The Potters,\\" also directed \\"A Lunatic at Large.\\" He is evidently a man who has a clear idea of comedy, who, while he does not frown upon the presence of an attractive heroine, does not feel inclined to throw away a well-knit story for a pretty face.Lifeless and Laughless.So far as drama is concerned, \\"New York\\" is a pathetic piece of work. It is a spineless production which dodders along in an unimaginative fashion. It was hoped that \\"New York\\" might be able to hold its own with \\"Broadway,\\" that astute stage reflection of realism; but the picture, which can boast only of the title of \\"New York,\\" strikes one as action inspired by poor screen material.Society girls once in a while may fall in love with trap drummers, but such cases are rare. In this instance there is no reason for the girl to take a sudden liking to the man who displays elastic bands on his shirt sleeves and looks at the idol of his heart with a woe-begone smile. Hence the yarn begins unconvincingly, and all that follows is a series of tedious scenes, with a villain who does not seem much of a villain, except that he is willing to permit the hero, who has won success as a song writer, to go on trial for a supposed murder which is only an accidental shooting.Down at the Fifth Avenue Playhouse there was an old-time picture called \\"Ruined,\\" which was made years and years ago. It looked its age, but it does not alter the fact that there is more entertainment in this ancient film than there is in \\"New York.\\" In those days they had the temerity to have a character with a beard, and you were spared the childish conception of a society girl setting her cap at a snare drummer. You could laugh at some of the flashbacks and serious sequences in \\"Ruined,\\" but \\"New York\\" is laughless and lifeless.Old Chaplin Comedies.IT was a joy to see another of Charlie Chaplin's ancient comedies. Last week there was at the Cameo his comedy, \\"Easy Street,\\" and at the Fifth Avenue Playhouse there was a still older specimen called \\"The Count.\\" The same man who figured as the big bully in \\"Easy Street\\" characterizes the impostor in \\"The Count,\\" Chaplin's conception of acting as a tailor's assistant and measuring women for tailor-made suits is in itself worthy of a good laugh, but when he uses his little cane on the refreshments one is impelled to greet these sequences with an immoderate show of merriment. When Chaplin flings whipped cream across a room he does it differently from anybody else, just as he can slip on a waxed floor probably better than any other comedian. He also reveals himself in \\"The Count\\" to be no mean acrobat; he never hesitates, whether he is darting under a big man's legs or under a table. LEON ERROL'S FUN; \\" The Lunatic at Large\\" Gives Loose-Ankled Comedian a Good Opportunity"},{"year":"1969","title":"AT its best, Agnes Varda's \\"Lion's Love\\" is a beautiful, cockeyed movie about a ménage à trois—Viva, Jerome Ragni and James Rado—who live on a Hollywood hilltop in a rented house with a giant bed, a heated swimming pool and plastic plants, mixed with real ones, both indoors and out.The three performers, who ostensibly play themselves as they wait for the big Hollywood break, couldn't care less about the new morality as defined in a sniggery movie like \\"Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice.\\" Viva and Jerry and Jim have passed beyond that frontier into a new innocence. Like three children on an extended sleep-out, they loll about in bed together in the morning, arguing cheerfully about who's going to get the coffee and making crank telephone calls (\\"Hello, Bank of America? I'd like to order $200 to go\\").Later Viva decides they should have children, but she regards the prospect of pregnancy without enthusiasm. \\"Do you think I could go through nine months of it and only come out with one?\\" Instead, they borrow some children to see what the experience might be like—and it's disaster. The kids refuse to take naps, urinate in the pool and eat nothing but french fries drenched in catchup. \\"I think,\\" says Viva, \\"we have to find another way to spiritual life.\\"In all of these random details, \\"Lions Love,\\" which was shown at the New York Film Festival Saturday night and again yesterday afternoon, is very funny, not much different from a television situation comedy, but one that is cool and loose and honest, more adult than most. It also possesses a sense of time and place. It's ironic that Miss Varda, whose husband, Jacques Demy, the gifted French director, tried unsuccessfully to capture the banal beauty of Los Angeles in his \\"The Model Shop,\\" does just that in \\"Lions Love\\" without seeming to try very hard.For about half the time, \\"Lions Love\\" is a kind of meta-Warhol movie, which is charming. Miss Varda has taken Viva, Warhol's most valuable found object, and lit and framed her in a way that brings out the gentle pre-Raphaelite beauty suggested but never realized in things like \\"Bike Boy,\\" \\"Lonesome Cowboy\\" and \\"Blue Movie.\\" Miss Varda has also found two perfect foils for Viva in the two stars and authors of \\"Hair.\\" Rado, blandly handsome and comparatively reserved, and Ragni, who looks and acts like a liberated member of the Three Stooges, share Viva's talent for the magnificently convoluted non sequitur.Unfortunately, Miss Varda has not been content just to doll up a simple, native American genre. The director, whose French films \\"Cleo from 5 to 7\\" and \\"Le Bonheur\\" aspired to a seriousness never successfully communicated, has sought to give both Pirandellian and social dimensions to her contemporary fairy tale.\\"Lions Love\\" tries to suggest multiple levels of reality by posing as a movie within a movie. Shirley Clarke, the real-life director (\\"The Connection,\\" \\"The Cool World\\"), plays herself, newly arrived in Hollywood to make a New York style underground film with Viva as star. Throughout \\"Lions Love\\" the actors talk to Miss Varda behind the camera and at one point Miss Varda steps in to show Shirley how to play a scene, a suicide, which Shirley says \\"is not my style.\\"Earlier Miss Clarke has observed: \\"I don't know whether I'm in a movie or directing one.\\" Since the audience is never in doubt, this sort of thing is simply precious. Miss Varda goes further astray with an extended sequence devoted to the assassination of Senator Robert F. Kennedy, as reported and reduced to comprehensible terms on television.At this point, you might as well turn away from the movie, which has gone glum and fake in all the wrong ways, and read an interview with Miss Varda, a five-page copy of which was given to the press by the producer.Among other things, she says, \\"Lions Love\\" is about stars, movies, rented houses, freedom in love, plastic flowers, freedom of final cut, trees, television and the shooting and death of Bobby Kennedy. It is about stars and movies, all right, but it's no more about any of the other things than the telephone directory is about the names it lists.In addition to the players already mentioned, \\"Lions Love\\" includes brief appearances by Eddie Constantine and Carlos Clarens, the film buff extraordinary (author of the excellent \\"An Illustrated History of the Horror Film\\"), who acts as Miss Clarke's walking Guide Michelin to Hollywood and narrates a delightful montage of views of Lotus Land as it is today. There is so much that is so pleasant in \\"Lions Love\\" that I wish Miss Varda hadn't tried to give it a larger significance, which—I'd like to add at the risk of sounding chauvinistic — seems paradoxically very naive and very French intellectual.AFTER 17 years in the wilderness, and with the restoration of some footage idiotically cut for its first New York run, Max Ophuls's \\"La Ronde\\" returned last night via the New York Film Festival. \\"La Ronde,\\" made in 1950, is the first of Ophuls's last four movies (the others are \\"Le Plaisir\\"—1951 \\"Madame de . . .\\"—1953 and \\"Lola Montes — 1955), which, together with the 1950's movies of Jean Renoir, constitute the two most sustained creative achievements in the history of film.Last year the festival presented \\"Lola Montes,\\" virtually rescued from oblivion by the brilliant proselytizing of the Village Voice film critic, Andrew Sarris. This year we have \\"La Ronde,\\" which, if less great than \\"Lola Montes,\\" is, on the other hand, more gracious and a more accessible introduction to the style and vision of Max Ophuls.Sometimes there seems to be so much style it is hard to accept the existence of a vision in Ophuls's movies. Undeniably he is the greatest ornamentalist among directors. Not only in the decorative density and the spatial surprises of his sets (the first sexual game of \\"La Ronde\\" is played up and down tremendous flights of steps","excerpt":"the second is observed through a foreground profusion of shrubs and branches) but also in his dedication to elaborate camera movement, Ophuls complicates everything that happens in his films. The point to remember is that all of the grand gestures and arabesques indicate form and discipline—and not mere indulgence in sensual excess.More readily apparent is Ophuls's unfailing gracefulness and delicacy. He never attempts to upset the vital balance of illusions in his opulent world (though the opulence may be no more than the play of a few lights on painted backdrops—as he openly shows it to be in \\"La Ronde\\") and he never ridicules his often trivial characters. Something akin to deeply ingrained very good manners is at work here, and the reward, as always in Ophuls, is that the unbearable becomes bearable and for a moment even humanly attractive it is no accident, and no inconsiderable virtue, that the loveliest kitsch movie music ever written occurs in the last four films of Max Ophuls.\\"La Ronde\\" is an adaptation of \\"Reigen,\\" a play in 10 brief dialogues written in 1897 by the Viennese dramatist Arthur Schnitzler. Each of Schnitzler's \\"dialogues\\" is essentially a blackout sketch a seduction followed by disillusioned aftermath, and one of the partners in each sketch appears in the following sketch. At the end of the play, a count bids a troubled goodbye to the same whore who welcomed a common soldier at the beginnig.Ophuls does not so much change as add to the original. A master of ceremonies, some of the paraphernalia of movie making, an elaborate program of transitions from episode, real carrousel to get things moving, and a sense of the past. Schnitzler wrote about his own time; the movie is about a time 50 years ago — and Ophuls is at pains to affirm the pastness of the past, and then to walk in and out of it as if it were the sound stage next door.\\"La Ronde\\" is about passing time, change, process. Schnitzler's ironic round dance becomes, in the shaping hands of Ophuls, a circular image of wholeness that incorporates and supports ideas of disorientation and disintegration, even to the cutting up of his movie. Ultimately the great sweeps and turns of Ophuls's cameras must be understood as spinning out of the artist's mind—for he is most crucially involved with his own creation.That is why Ophuls includes a master of ceremonies, who is surely himself, and is also a surrogate for the audience, and who both observes and promotes the action of his film. It is a difficult and not wholly honorable task, and though the master of \\"La Ronde\\" (Anton Walbrook) maintains his suave dignity throughout, he must pay a price for what he does and what he knows. He becomes in some measure responsible for the condition of a world that is falling apart at the seams.But while the carrousel still turns (it is beginning to break down) it brings us wonderful images—as once when Danielle Darrieux, wavering on the way to her young lover's bedroom, pauses for a moment and does not quite smile but with a movement of her eyes and face, accepts the pleasure, the pain, the knowledge and the grace that is the condition of her cursed and lovely life.\\"La Ronde\\" will play again in Alice Tully Hall on Saturday at midnight.

With no recognizable landmark further north than Cooper Square, it nevertheless feels like Bronxville or the quieter stretches of the upper East Side.Not that it aspires to quietness or that it even for a second eschews relevancy. One major portion (for me, the best portion) depicts an all-black play production, \\"Be Black, Baby,\\" in which the cast, in white face, mingles with, steals from, and finally beats and rapes the white liberal audience. And the hero, a young Vietnam veteran, moves from filthy picture-taking to middle-class apartment house bombing, partly in an effort to achieve total involvement—which, in the terms of this film, seems necessarily to include a final solution.But the eager hero (Robert De Niro) and the over-eager heroine (Jennifer Salt, the major interest of the flashbacks in \\"Midnight Cowboy,\\" revealed as a fine comedienne here) are so clean-cut","excerpt":"the second leads, white and black, so epitomize attractive youth; and the supporting cast, as in many Brian De Palma movies, could so handsomely model a panoramic painting of the Rape of the Seven Sister Colleges; that an air of tasteful respectability pervades even the outrageous violence. As if they were making bombs on West 11th Street.\\"Hi, Mom!\\" turns approximately every other current social misery to a comedy that is sometimes quite elabborately successful and sometimes only well intentioned. As in De Palma's previous \\"Greetings,\\" the humor, at its best, is understated but highly structured—so that you have to work a bit for your laughs. But \\"Hi, Mom!\\" is much sharper, crueler, funnier. Although it scatters some shots (often in a kind of fast-motion photography that seems an addiction of De Palma's) it pulls enough together to suggest some major insights, as it investigates the militarization and despoliation of Washington Square South.But it is the minor insights that most happily remain: the white black-power activist (Gerrit Graham) who for a second demurs before painting his body entirely black; the pornographic-movie impresario (Allen Garfield) who wants to make \\"the first children's exploitation film—nothing dirty, nothing smutty;\\" or the mere idea of the TV show that chronicles the opening night of \\"Be Black, Baby!\\" A production of National Intellectual Television, it is called \\"N.I.T.

On the face of it, and an hour-and-a-half-long face it is, it seems to be the same operetta the Shuberts produced on Broadway a few seasons back. But the credits list a different pair of authors—though why folks should squabble over such a plot is beyond us—so that phase of it must be passed over with raised eyebrow.It is a skittish trifle, stretched over three generations and a sentimental framework, chronicling the curious affinity of the Grandprés for the de Chalenceys. The first Grandpré, a ballet girl, gave up her Marquis de Chalencey so that he would not have to leave his real love, the army","excerpt":"the second Marquis gave up the second Grandpré so she would not have to leave the musical comedy stage; the third members of the line fight like the dickens but ultimately come to romantic terms in the movies. The story ends there, one generation short of the battle of broadcasting and the truce of television.Since Miss Printemps trips through it all with grace, verve and a little voice well tuned to the little Strauss waltzes, it would be ungrateful to dismay the nosegay as so much beet-tops. Actually the camera man has found several pretty scenes, the wardrobe mistress has exhumed several pretty costumes, and the writers, whoever they really were, have fashioned a few pretty conceits to please the patrons. Particularly is this true of the modern sequence, where some gleams of wit are permitted to penetrate the pall of lavender and old lace which hangs over the film's earlier two-thirds.Pierre Fresnay, the tireless chap who plays a lover for three generations, has not even the usual armament of an operatic lover—a tenor voice. He seems to feel the lack, wears a hangdog look when any of the three Grandprés are caroling, suggests he would give anything to try a few \\"mi-mi-mis\\" himself. It mightn't have been a bad idea. With an operetta as operatic in treatment, character and plot as \\"Three Waltzes,\\" the policy should be whole hog or none—if that isn't too blunt a way of phrasing it.

And so began years of appeals and public protests and petitions that took on international dimensions and brought in everybody from Jean-Paul Sartre to the Pope. The couple became icons of the left during the cold war; they were compared to Dreyfus and to Sacco and Vanzetti.

Based on seven years of research, it assesses Johnson's career as it was played out against the vast panorama of 20th-century American history.

This method was used for three very diverse pieces - the 45-minute ''Coyote Dances,'' the 20-minute ''Bacchus'' and the seven-minute ''On the Leopard Altar.'' ''Bacchus'' was a theatrical showpiece. Jessica Lowe, David Kuehn, Brad Ellis and Mariliz Romano sat, formally dressed, inside an acoustically isolated capsule at a table laden with glasses and wine bottles. They sang fragments of sentences about the pleasures of wine while tapping, rubbing or blowing on the glasses and bottles, which were retuned by drinking the wine in them. Through Mr. Lentz's multitracking, the sounds and text fragments built up until the full quotations were heard. It was wry, delicate music.

In ''Images of Childhood'' (The Main Street Press), Anita Schorsch has found an answer in five invoices addressed in 1685 to a leading Boston bookseller.   Of the thousands of different books brought to New England before 1700, the first and largest category was religious and included sermons, catechisms, aids to piety, and concordances","excerpt":"the second was school texts; the third was Bibles and psalm books. What followed in popularity were romances and books on practical morality, essays and philosophy. Modern English poetry, classical literature, geographies, dictionaries, biographies, and books on law, history, navigation, astronomy, cookery and travel were shipped in much smaller numbers. Many of the same books were shared by adults and children alike. Although the pious, like the later evangelicals, did not approve of children reading romantic literature because it stirred the ''common passions'' without offering a moral point, the five invoices addressed in 1685 to John Usher, the leading book dealer in Boston, indicate that the fourth largest category of books imported to New England was romance and light fiction. The ''how-to'' books on worldly and spiritual advancement under God's jurisdiction were just behind the romances in popularity and offered advice on how to be a ''good'' merchant, how to be a ''good'' seaman, how to be a ''good'' husbandman, how to be a ''good'' gardener, and, of particular interest to us, how to be a ''good'' parent and how to be a ''good'' child.

Without Miss Hutchinson's admirable services there is no telling what would be said of \\"The Melody Lingers On,\\" the new photoplay at the Rivoli. Even with her there to instill some semblance of life into the whitened bones that form its story, the film falls lamentably short of perfection.As always, when there is cinema carping to be done, the first blow must be directed at the collective chin of the script boys. With the aid of Lowell Brentano's novel and the scenario writers' primer, they have evolved a tale of the wartime romance of the great tenor and the budding young pianiste. When the father is killed the mother is compelled to leave the son as a foundling in a convent. Eighteen years later, after she has become a concert star, she traces the boy to his adoptive home and, going there, finds the youth being inhibited by his parents. It seems they want him to become a diplomat instead of a singer.The problem, then, which the picture takes about sixty minutes to introduce, is how the mother, without revealing her relationship, can help him realize his hereditary destiny instead of being forced by his doting guardians into statesmanship.Having in mind how certain of the screen's better-known Duses would open the emotional flood-gates at the maudlin opportunities offered by this drama, one can but bow before Miss Hutchinson's restraint. Without attempting to clock these things, we can recall but three times during the picture when she permitted a tear to stray down her cheek. Once was when her piano teacher and guardian dies","excerpt":"the second was when she hears of her lover's death, and the third when her son makes his triumphal début at La Scala.If for no other reason, and a few more might be added, we submit that this entitles Miss Hutchinson to consideration for the Academy award. Less notable on the dramatic record, however, is the performance of George Houston as the ill-fated tenor and of David Scott as the son. Both seemed a trifle expansive as to gesture and expression.

Thus, three men from the same village, each of whom was named William, might be told apart in local records by the first being called William Black, commemorating the man's dark complexion","excerpt":"the second William might be called William Carpenter because that was his trade; and the third became William Ford because he lived where the local stream was most easily crossed.\\n\\nEarly Connecticut and Massachusetts attracted, from the British Isles, talented workers whose skills were needed to build new settlements, ambitious craftsmen who wanted to make a better living and at the same time own their own land.

The contrast, however, is instructive, because the museum show, focusing on the ways in which Hudson River School landscapists incorporated mills, furnaces and other Satanic paraphernalia into their work, seems by far the more up to date of the two. Mostly, this is because Kenneth Maddox, the curator who organized the material for Bard College's Edith C. Blum Art Institute, has angled it to accord with the hindsight of 20th-century environmentalists. And it may be that he has overdone it, at least in his catalogue essay, which documents in great detail the various industries as they developed, before and after the Civil War, and their impact.  But if all the facts, figures, literary quotations and footnotes sometimes make for indigestible reading, they do emphasize important points. Notable among these is that industrialization with its promise of relief from individual drudgery was viewed more optimistically than now, that the fervor with which it was embraced here was all but religious, and that, nevertheless, there were dissenters on both sides of the Atlantic.

There are two sets, at 10:30 P.M. and 12:30 A.M. , and $75 gets you a four-course meal and Champagne, while $35 lets you stand at the bar. P. W. Time-Warped Tunes    Michael White, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 255-4037. Mr. White, a clarinetist, leads what may be the best New Orleans-style band in jazz. It's polyphonic, with tight ensemble parts giving way to the raucous group improvisations that bray and holler. He has become a New Year's tradition at the Vanguard, and hearing his band invites audiences into a time warp; it makes a listener understand why the music so quickly became the popular dance music of its era. There is a $40 cover and a $20 minimum. Sets are at 9:30 and 11:30 P.M. There is also a 1 A.M. show with a $20 cover and a $10 minimum. P. W. Piano Man    John Hicks, Bradley's, 70 University Place, Greenwich Village, (212) 228-6440. He's a florid pianist who always plays like he's never going to play again, and wants to get everything he knows in by the last chorus. He'll be backed by the bassist Santi Debriano and the drummer Victor Lewis, who is one of jazz's greatest living drummers. It will be interactive, a three-way musical conversation at its best. The show starts at 9, and for $120 there is a five-course dinner and Champagne. Before 1 A.M. there is a $25 cover and $20 minimum for the bar. From 1 to 4 A.M., the cover is $20 and there is a $15 minimum. P. W. Two Wily Veterans    Nancy Wilson and Gato Barbieri, Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 475-0049. Ms. Wilson can be a viscerally moving performer, one of the best singers to graduate from Dinah Washington's vocal finishing school. She can be smooth or rough and nasal, and both stances imply emotion. Mr. Barbieri is a showman whose best recordings, made in the 1960's, have a hard power. Tickets are available for the 7 P.M. show in the bar for $90. At 1 A.M., the $120 tickets include breakfast and Champagne. P. W. Ulmer Power    James Blood Ulmer, Knitting Factory, 47 East Houston Street, East Village, (212) 219-3055. This year is Mr. Ulmer's fifth New Year's Eve at the Knitting Factory, which sounds a bit like a tradition. The guitarist has recorded with everyone from Ornette Coleman to Art Blakey and Joe Henderson. His current music, which makes use of drones and odd tunings, is as distinct as anything that walks the planet. It's hard-rocking, slippery music, charged with power. Sets are at 9 and midnight, and the $20 cover buys a free drink and a Champagne toast. P. W. Dark Side Sounds    Stephen Scott, Down Beat, 70 Grove Street, off Sheridan Square, Greenwich Village, (212) 620-4000. Mr. Scott is the most austere pianist of his generation, somebody who plays the dark side of every tune. The music comes out moody and emotional. He's anything but glib, and his sense of space is wonderfully Monkish, elegant and relaxed, yet taut. He's a young master. There are three sets, at 9 and 11 P.M. and at 1 A.M. The $35 cover includes two drinks plus Champagne and party favors. P. W. Adderley's Band    Nat Adderley, Sweet Basil, 88 Seventh Avenue South, above Bleecker Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 242-1785. One of the best working bands in jazz features Mr. Adderley's cool sound on horn, and Vincent Herring's explosive soloing on alto and soprano saxophones. The rhythm section includes Rob Bargan on piano, Walter Booker on bass and Jimmy Cobb on drums and it swings with authority. It's mainstream jazz at its most exciting. The show starts at 9 P.M. and $99 includes dinner, Champagne and party favors. The late show, which starts at 1 A.M., has a $25 cover and a $25 minimum, and includes a Champagne toast. P. W. Visiones, in the Village    Cecil Brooks 3d, Visiones, 125 Macdougal Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 673-5576. Mr. Brooks, a good young drummer, always leads swinging bands, and this one includes the trumpeter Jack Walrath and the pianist James Weidman. Jeanie Bryson, a singer, will be on hand as well. Sets are at 8:30 and 11 P.M. and at 1:30 A.M. The first set has a $12 cover and a $10 minimum; the second, a $25 cover and a $10 minimum, and the 1:30 set has a $10 cover and $10 minimum. For $100, stay for three sets and have a full dinner and Champagne; $65 buys three sets, three drinks and a Champagne toast. P. W. Sharp in SoHo    Elliott Sharp, Nick and Eddie, 203 Spring Street, at Sullivan Street, SoHo, (212) 219-9090. Mr. Sharp, a guitarist and fixture of the downtown experimental scene, will be leading a trio that shows his roots. From 9:30 to midnight, he'll be playing jazz standards. At midnight he'll start playing blues. The $75 ticket includes a four-course dinner and a Champagne toast. P. W.

Clinton did attempt dramatic transformations: gays in the military, health care reform, welfare reform. The first enraged social conservatives","excerpt":"the second, big business. The third dismayed Clinton's own base.    Ehrenhalt seems to believe that Clinton's conciliatory behavior makes frustration with him a non sequitur. But huge numbers of Americans felt betrayed by Slick Willie's lack of core principles, and resented the discovery that what Clinton sold as the practice of a deeply held faith turned out to be mere dabbling in compensatory sanctimony.     As for historical perspective, we shouldn't overlook that ''60 Minutes'' interview of January 1992. Asked by Steve Kroft whether he had told the truth about Gennifer Flowers, Clinton insisted, ''I have absolutely leveled with the American people.'' Of course, that just wasn't so. As, indeed, we discovered time and again.    Thus large numbers of people who invested optimism in The Man From Hope became embittered by Clinton's penchant for breaking promises and for eroding, in the process, the very culture of trust on which a liberal commonwealth depends. And, on this point, I'm really speaking only for people who voted for Clinton, not those who despised him all along.    Pier Kooistra  Lawrenceville, N.J.

The Edwardian period has long been dismissed as a mere interlude between the Victorian era and World War I. Hattersley, a former deputy leader of the Labor Party and cabinet minister, will have none of this. Displaying an A. J. P. Taylor-like zest for turning orthodoxy on its head, Hattersley argues that the Edwardians blazed the path to modernity. He traces the emergence of the Labor Party and the consequences of David Lloyd George's famous 1909 ''People's Budget,'' which levied punitive taxes on the aristocracy. His forays into social history, including the rise of the populist Fleet Street ''New Journalism,'' are never less than riveting. Looming over Hattersley's account is the shadow of Queen Victoria's insolent grandson, Kaiser Wilhelm, whose fecklessness triggered the Big Bang of August 1914, which toppled the Russian and Austro-Hungarian dynasties, not to mention his own. For all the ferment chronicled by Hattersley, it was the British monarchy that proved the ultimate survivor.       LAVOISIER IN THE YEAR ONE: The Birth of a New Science in an Age of Revolution. By Madison Smartt Bell. (Norton, $22.95.) Bell's little biography of the 18th-century French chemist and social reformer Antoine Laurent Lavoisier is a two-part thriller. The first describes Lavoisier's successful effort to win the race to explain how chemical processes work","excerpt":"the second, his pursuit by French revolutionaries. Lavoisier's immense wealth and genius allowed him to construct one of the most advanced laboratories in Europe, where he demolished the traditional notion of phlogiston -- an imaginary element supposedly present in combustible objects -- by identifying oxygen. By 1793, however, Lavoisier fell victim to the calumnies circulated by his envious scientific rival, Jean-Paul Marat, who was also a Jacobin pamphleteer. As an aristocrat and partner in the reviled General Farm, which collected taxes on behalf of the Bourbon monarchy, Lavoisier was an easy target. Exhibiting a bit of impatience with Lavoisier's imperturbable faith in scientific order and equilibrium, Bell suggests that his guillotining may go some way toward demarcating the limits of the Enlightenment faith in rationality.

In fact, there is little evidence to support this claim.

In the process, she rattles the skeletons in the closet of her Mississippi family as it nears the end of a long decline from gothic gentility to middle-class normalcy.

When she comes into an unexpected inheritance, she assembles a female cohort to follow the footsteps of Virgil's Aeneas from Carthage to Naples, a voyage into the classical past that allows them to shore up their own private ruins.

IN THE DEVIL'S SNARE: The Salem Witchcraft Crisis of 1692, by Mary Beth Norton. (Vintage, $15.) Seeking to restore the proper historical context to Salem's witchcraft trials, the author connects them to the terrifying Indian wars along New England's northern frontier and the spiritual warfare taking place within the village's meetinghouse. The result is a ''rabble-rouser of a book'' that ''defies both conventional 'Crucible'-inspired wisdom and prevailing scholarship,'' Jill Lepore wrote here in 2002.

A young woman, eager to escape the chaos of her personal life, decides to write a play based on the exploits of an intrepid Victorian Englishwoman who journeyed to West Africa. Alternating between the lives of the two heroines, ''the novel is ambitious not only in its historical and geographical sweep but also in its author's choice to confine himself, with admirable conviction and credibility, to the consciousness of two women,'' Janet Burroway said here last year.

The 83-year-old Pennsylvania Building on the Christina River, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, seemed likely to benefit from the public-private renewal efforts around the building. Those efforts began 1986, when the city, state and two development firms initiated the Christina Gateway project.    Plans called for 10 acres near the river to be redeveloped with four office buildings and a festival marketplace.

Patton, a Baltimore architect, it was hoped it would be an integral part of the festival marketplace.    The building was designed by the Victorian architect Frank Furness, who also did Philadelphia's Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts and Broad Street Station. The Pennsylvania Building, on a 1.7-acre site, had been the headquarters of the Delaware Railroad.    To finance the rehabilitation, the developers got a $2.5 million loan from Wilmington Savings Fund Society and $1.3 million from Transportation Associates of Philadelphia, the former owner.   Despite the rehabilitation, the six-story building has four vacant floors. Richard D. Berl of B.

A bankruptcy petition was filed but was dismissed in September after the bank challenged the action. The dismissal lets the bank move forward with the foreclosure and a sale of the building.   Real estate agents say the building lost much of its marketability because land along the river, which had been used as a parking lot, was sold by the developers.    \\"It was the wrong move because any investor interested in the building will know that the view of the river could be blocked,\\" said P. Gerald White, head of an eponymous real estate company here.    But Mr. White also said the building could not compete with the two completed Gateway buildings or with others throughout downtown.

Norman Schwarzkopf and his multi-million-dollar book advance and forget Barbara Taylor Bradford and her multi-million-dollar book contract and Stephen King and his multi-million-dollar book contract.   The average writer in America earns less than $9,000 a year for writing, representatives of several writers organizations say, and is ignored and abused by publishers.   To draw attention to what they described as the plight of B-list authors -- and even, sometimes, A-list authors who have less star quality -- several groups representing writers declared yesterday \\"Writers Rights Day\\" and staged a two-hour protest at Grand Central Terminal, where they signed a Declaration of Writers' Economic Rights and urged writers to band together to defend themselves.   \\"You read in the papers about the multi-million-dollar book deals that a handful of writers are fortunate enough to get,\\" Erica Jong, the president of the Authors Guild, told about 200 people at the former Incoming Train Room at the station. \\"You don't read about the canceled contracts, the writers sued to pay advances back with interest, the writers who worked 4 years or 7 years or 10 years only to have it orphaned when some fancy new Japanese or German conglomerate bought the publishing house and fired the editors who were the authors' only contact.\\"   The protest brought together several writers' groups that had steadfastly disagreed on how best to help authors. Among the groups participating here and in similar events around the country were the Authors Guild, the National Writers Union, the Published Authors Network, the Romance Writers of America and the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America.   \\"Ten years ago, you couldn't have gotten all these groups together,\\" said Susan Cheever, the author. \\"But the economic situation has become so bad that writers have no other choice but to work together for better working conditions.\\"   Protest organizers compared their efforts to the organizing of the Screen Writers Guild in the 1940's, saying they hoped that one day publishers, among other things, would contribute to health insurance and pension funds for authors, the way movie studios must now do for screen writers.   The National Writers Union addressed one of the chief complaints of its 3,200 members -- the difficulty in getting health insurance -- by becoming an affiliate of the United Auto Workers last year.   The groups also want to establish minimum standards for writers' contracts, including higher and more timely payments, making publishers assume or share the cost of libel insurance and giving writers a fair amount of time to return advances on canceled projects.   \\"We have a lot of work to do among writers, building their consciousness and convincing them that together we have power that we don't have individually,\\" said Barbara Raskin, the novelist. \\"Many writers are afraid of alienating publishers and won't stand up for themselves.\\"   Several of the writers who participated in yesterday's protest said they wondered, \\"Why Grand Central Terminal?\\" Then they learned that while the station cost $2,000, space in other buildings they considered more appropriate to their cause, like the New York Public Library, would have cost at least five times as much.   \\"We thought it was unusual,\\" said Jonathan Tasini, the president of the National Writers Union. \\"But mostly it was cheap. You see writers are frequently driven by economic imperative.\\" New Paperback Chief    Clare Ferraro has been editor in chief of Ballantine for about three weeks, and she said she has already learned one very important thing about the business of mass-market paperbacks: it's not good enough these days to buy a best seller, shrink it, put on a paper cover and send it off into bookstores for a guaranteed paperback success.   \\"The days of sending out a book and just assuming it will stick are over,\\" said Ms. Ferraro, who was been senior vice president and associate publisher of Ballantine/Del Rey,/ Fawcett/Ivy before being named to replace Robert Wyatt as the head of Ballantine.    \\"It's always been true that you have to know the market you're trying to reach,\\" she said. \\"But now more than ever, if you don't communicate through packaging and promotion what you are selling and if you don't find out whether what you're selling is what the public wants to read, then you are in big trouble.\\"   The authors she inherited at Ballantine are an impressive lot, including Michael Crichton, Norman Mailer, Martha Grimes, John Irving, Marilyn French and John Hassler. She also inherited a bit of an awkward situation, with her predecessor resigning abruptly one day, saying he was unhappy at the publishing house. All those authors and the editors and publicity people and office staff members now have to be reassured that Ballantine is secure and that Mr. Wyatt's displeasures will not undermine business.   Although she has been at Ballantine since 1979, she has always worked on the business side, not the editorial side. Still, she said, making such a transition within a familiar house is easier than making such a leap to someplace new. \\"At least,\\" she said, \\"I know who to ask when I don't know where to go.\\" Royal Expose    Imagine you are an American publisher who has recently paid more than $4 million to an author to write an expose of the British royal family that is to be published around 1995 and suddenly several hot new British books are elbowing each other to reveal intimate details about the Princess of Wales. \\"Our book looks even better to me,\\" said Laurence J. Kirshbaum, president of Warner Books, which signed Kitty Kelley to the royal project. \\"As a former editor said to me, 'Everything's been done before","excerpt":"the secret is how well you do it this time around.' Besides, we figure that we have Kitty Kelley and, frankly, she's the star of this book, not Princess Di. Her name goes on top, not the royal family.\\" . . . Oh, the places Dr. Seuss continues to go!

Neil A. Grauer, a freelance journalist and cartoonist, has provided the best to date: an appreciative, sympathetic overview of a singular talent and the often compromised life it inhabited. Neither a literary adulation (like Charles S. Holmes's biography, \\"The Clocks of Columbus\\") nor an irritable diminishment (like Burton Bernstein's \\"Thurber: A Biography\\"), REMEMBER LAUGHTER: A Life of James Thurber (University of Nebraska, $20) manages to offer a writer's life with a balance that is often lost in contemporary biography. Expedient, germane and selective, the book maintains an interest in the subject's personal life and development only to illuminate Thurber's work, which is what warranted the biography in the first place. Though Mr. Grauer necessarily relies on previous criticism, Thurber's letters and interviews with the author's few remaining associates (most of whom, alas, knew Thurber in his last two decades, when alcohol often inspired more diatribe than humor), his own opinions allow for both circumspection and conviction. Mr. Grauer fairly inventories the sources for Thurber's uncanny fictionalized memoirs as well as his later \\"grumpy and misanthropic\\" tone when he assumed \\"the role of a nearly perpetual pallbearer for comedy.\\" Throughout, Mr. Grauer does not permit a demeaning anecdote to displace the genuine accomplishments that continue to provide the greater perspective. \\"Remember Laughter\\" takes its title to heart, which should give readers a reason to celebrate.\\nMICHAEL J.

Is \\"N.Y.P.D. Blue\\" in the top 20? Will NBC cancel \\"Sea Quest DSV\\"? It's the television ratings game. As a society obsessed with knowing who is No. 1, hundreds of thousands of people indulge in the game each week, checking A. C. Nielsen's list of the top 20 prime-time shows to see which ones are gaining ground and which are losing. \\n\\nFundamentally it is a numbers game. The starting point for Nielsen, the leading research firm that tracks television viewing habits, is the 94.2 million American homes with television sets. Through extensive sur\\nveys the company comes up with a statistical sample reflective of the demographics of the entire country. Then Nielsen slices and dices the sample, pulling out families that represent a particular segment: for instance, the shows most watched by college-educated urban white males ages 35 to 49 with incomes over $100,000. That sort of exacting analysis is purchased by those who traffic in commercial time: the networks who sell it and the advertisers and their agents who buy it. But the only numbers fed to an information-hungry public each week are the total household ratings, the same measure that has been used since Nielsen began counting in the 1950's, when the average home had one television set. Now 70 percent of those homes have at least two sets, and 34 percent have three or more.
