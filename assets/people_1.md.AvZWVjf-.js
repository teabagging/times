The playwright, Oleg Pavlovich Tabakov, was exiled from Russia in 1974 and died in Paris in 1977. He was the founder of the Moscow Theater-Studio, which carried on performances in a basement. In 1987 he was posthumously awarded the title of People's Artist of the Soviet Union, and his theater was given official status and granted permission to tour outside the Soviet Union, performing in arts festivals in Germany, Egypt, Scotland and France.    \\"My Big Land\\" follows the progress of a father and son from the time they leave their village in 1929, to Moscow in 1937, and on through the devastation that Russia suffered during World War II.

GEOFFREY HOLDER'S ART     Geoffrey Holder's talents as dancer, choreographer, costume designer and actor are better known to the public than are his skills in painting and photography. His drawings and paintings are in the permanent collection of the Corcoran Gallery in Washington, the Barbados Museum and the North Carolina Central University Museum.   Over the years he and his wife, the dancer Carmen de Lavallade, have acquired an unusual collection of other people's paintings, sculptures and masks, from Mexico, Africa and the Caribbean. An exhibition of 150 pieces opens today and continues through May 5 at the Katonah Museum of Art, under the title \\"Spirits: From the Collection of Geoffrey Holder.\\"    Most of the work was done by self-taught, sometimes anonymous artists","excerpt":"some pieces are by acknowledged masters of the folk-art tradition. Among the latter are Elijah Pierce, an black American carver of religious subjects; Pucho Odio, a Cuban-American sculptor; and Hector Hyppolite, a Haitian painter and voodoo priest. Ranging over a broad field of subjects and techniques, the collection's coherence is attained through a running thread of spirituality.   The 37-year-old museum is on Route 22 at Jay Street, in a new building with an outdoor sculpture garden designed by Edward Larrabee Barnes. It is open free of charge Tuesdays through Fridays and on Sundays from 1 to 5 P.M. and Saturdays from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. Free tours are given on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Sundays at 2:30 P.M.

Misao Furuta, a teacher of ikebana in Manhattan and Westchester, has organized the exhibition, called \\"Hina to Hana -- Dolls and Flowers,\\" with Houka Moriwaki, who teaches in Westchester, Manhattan and New Jersey.

SOUTH AFRICAN ART     Art by children from a racially mixed school in South Africa can be seen through March 22 at the Chappaqua Library, at 195 South Greeley Avenue. The unusual exhibition reflects a Government policy introduced in January of this year at 33 previously all-white public schools in the Transvaal province, where parents agreed to plans for limited integration. Schools in other sections of the country are expected to follow the procedure.   St. Andrew's School, where this \\"Land of Peace\\" exhibition originated, is one of the newly integrated schools. The exhibition is a colorful collection of works depicting peaceful bus riders, pupils in their classrooms, children playing together and other scenes of racial harmony.    Library hours are Mondays through Thursdays, 9 A.M. to 9 P.M.; Fridays from 9 A.M. to 6 P.M.; Saturdays from 9 A.M. to 5 P.M. and Sundays from 1 to 4 P.M. The phone number is 238-4779.

Rosen and George Schaub are photographers who frequently write about their work.  \\n\\n Shooting Thanksgiving festivities with a Super 8 movie camera or one of the new portable videocassette recorders is a rewarding experience that can provide pleasure for the photographer, and all the friends and relatives involved for years afterward. Shooting with a motion picture camera or VCR is more satisfying that shooting with a still camera because by the very nature of the recording medium, it looks live. That's why a Thanksgiving gathering shot this year will still look like it's this year when you play it back next week, next month, next year or 10 years from now.\\n\\n\\nTo shoot the Thanksgiving festivities your first consideration, after checking out the camera and loading it with the proper film (or videotape, if you are using a vidcam) will be lighting. If you are near a window, there may be enough ambient light to get a good picture without the use of any additional lighting. But if the light coming in from outside is too dim, or if you are not shooting near a window, your only alternative is to light the scene yourself.

The best reason to do your own photographic printing is to keep control of the finished product. Good commercial labs can make acceptable prints, but they can rarely do them exactly as you would print them yourself. There are many decisions to be made, ones that only the photographer who took the picture can make for complete satisfaction. \\n\\nWhen making an enlargement in the darkroom, make a straight print first to see whether that picture needs any manipulation to improve it. Many prints do not, but you cannot tell until the dried print is examined in good light to determine if tonal adjustments should be made.\\n\\nIf the first print is too light, increase exposure time under the enlarger for the next one. If too dark, decrease the exposure time. Reverse these adjustments if working with a positive process, such as Cibachrome. If the print seems dark but flat with muddy blacks and dull whites, increase contrast by changing the paper type or grade, by changing the developer or its dilution or by using a different light source in the enlarger.

These will insure reasonably good pictures in most situations, but they offer no challenge to creativity. However, those who prefer to shoot pictures at night, indoors or outdoors, can now get pleasing results without using flash, due to the introduction of faster films and to the use of simple techniques that not all photographers are familiar with.\\n\\nNight photography really falls into several different categories, based on shutter speeds that are practical for the scene, and on suitable lens openings. In dim-light situations where you can't handhold a camera because of the slow shutter speeds required, you will need a tripod or support of some kind, but in most cases using one of the fast new films available will eliminate the need for this. \\n\\nFor most picture-taking after dark you will need a camera with adjustable shutter and lens openings - the most frequent choice being a 35mm single-lens reflex because many of these models offer long,electronically-timed exposures, and all of the newest fast films are made exclusively for 35mm cameras.

For both the local stage and the more or less local talking pictures have lifted up loud, strident voices in the forceful art of melodrama. In short, there have been plenty of such enticements","excerpt":"some say, indeed, that there have been too many.At all events, not a night passes without some trembling Oriental being caught in the net of his own weaving; not an afternoon closes without some poor, white-faced girl having been in the clutches of a Foul Villain. And wistful, elderly men, sitting in Row A at a musical comedy praising a night in Gibraltar, have been startled by the sounds of musketry in the theatre next door.The latest offering to bedeck Scotland Yard with a halo of success is \\"The Mysterious Dr. Fu Manchu,\\" which now holds forth in its eerie fashion at the Rialto. And \\"Fu Manchu\\" is like the rest; it has detectives, green dragons, peepholes, trapdoors, Oriental chemicals—and an intense cacophony of sound. On the whole—that is, with the usual phrase \\"for melodrama\\"—it is quite entertaining.In translating the Rohmer novel to the talkies, sound and sound-effect screen, the producers have kept a wise eye on the practical uses of motivation. \\"The Mysterious Dr. Fu Manchu\\" runs along smoothly over its various crimes and intended crimes without faltering on the way. Its climax is in the proper place and its comic relief is well situated.Warner Oland has the part of Fu, the chief character as well as the villain of the story, and gives a good interpretation of his role. Neil Hamilton is the nominal hero of the picture, and Jean Arthur is the heroine. To O. P. Heggie belongs a checkered cap reminiscent of another great detective and the part plainly labeled \\"Nayland Smith of Scotland Yard.\\"\\"The Mysterious Dr. Fu Manchu\\" employs those famous Broadway partners, sound and dialogue. Under the former heading are all manner of pistol shots, windstorms and grim meanings; under the latter are conversations, threats, exclamations and protests from all concerned. Mr. Oland's voice deserves particular notice because of its clarity and effectiveness.New Borzage Film.THE three who made \\"Street Angel\\" and \\"Seventh Heaven\\"—Charles Farrell, Janet Gaynor and Frank Borzage, their director—are once again at the Roxy Theatre. This time their offering is called \\"Lucky Star.\\" And once again, by the use of their combined talents, they have been able to transfer a sentimental little bit of nothing into a good picture.\\"Lucky Star\\" is about a soldier who was crippled in France, and returns home unable to resume his former occupation. He meets the girl with whom he had a childish fight before going to war, and the pair presently fall in love. When the girl's mother tries to persuade her to marry some one else, the young hero hobbles to the rescue. And before the rescue has been completed he has regained the use of his limbs.Mr. Borzage's touch was be found throughout the picture. The opening scene is typically his—a small, tumble-down farmhouse in the half light of dawn. Later it is noted that the house has a rickety shingle roof and broken window shutters. The items are important only in that they set a finished atmosphere.\\"Lucky Star\\" is partly silent and partly talking, being divided about equally into the two molds. Miss Gaynor's voice is that of a very young girl—which fits in admirably with the role slip, plays; and Mr. Farrell's has something resembling a New England twang. There are also certain sound effects scattered through the film, notably the playing of phonograph records and the noise of a train's departure.Miss Gaynor and Mr. Farrell have been fortunate in the members of their supporting cast, for all of them—including three children—have given good performances. The most outstanding member of the supporting cast is Hedwiga Reicher, who has the rôle of Ma Tucker. It is a very difficult part to play; Miss Reicher has done it well.With Peggy Wood.PEGGY WOOD'S entry into the talking pictures is by way of a rather unusual film called \\"Wonder of Women.\\" The story is taken from Sudermann's \\"The Wife of Stephan Tromholt,\\" and Clarence Brown directed it. And it is altogether possible that the picture will not do as well in a box-office way as it should.The current legend about it is that Mr. Brown became a bit tired of filming the love affairs of undergraduates, and wondered whether the love affairs of adults might make a picture. He acquired Lewis Stone and Miss Wood for his leading actors and set about finding out. The result seems to show that he guessed correctly.The film differs from the ordinary movie in more ways than the lack of cocktail shaking on the part of the characters. For one of them—that played by Miss Wood—dies, and the other renounces the charms of the world in order to continue \\"our\\" work. The acting is excellent.\\"Wonder of Women,\\" like \\"Lucky Star,\\" is partly talking and partly silent. It would, perhaps, have been better and more effective to have had it one thing or the other.\\"Smiling Irish Eyes.\\"COLLEEN MOORE'S latest picture is about a violinist and an Irish colleen and it tells how the latter helped the former to fame and fortune. Some of the more useful props of the film are a theme song (called \\"Smiling Irish Eyes\\") and a pig named Aloysius. When the picture had passed on its dim way there is a strong likelihood that the state of the drama will be just about where it was.The story starts in Ireland, and beats its Vitaphonic way to America and back to Ireland once again. \\"Smiling Irish Eyes\\" is told in song and by orchestration many, many times. And when the theme song is not being used there are other musical interpolations.On the whole, \\"Smiling Irish Eyes\\" is a somewhat silly and incredible picture, and will do little to enhance Miss Moore's reputation.

A1    Ethiopia at War in Somalia  Ethiopia officially plunged into war with Somalia's Islamist forces, bombing targets inside Somalia and putting Ethiopian ground troops on the march in an escalation that could turn Somalia's internal crisis into a religious conflict that engulfs the entire Horn of Africa.   A1    At Axis of Episcopal Split  Archbishop Peter J. Akinola of Nigeria, a man whose reputation has been built on his stance against homosexuality and who has created an offshoot of his Nigerian church in North America, has become the spiritual head of 21 conservative churches in the United States. The churches opted to leave the Episcopal Church over its decision to consecrate a gay bishop and allow churches to bless same-sex unions.   A1    Iran Defiant After Sanctions  Iran reacted defiantly to the United Nations Security Council resolution imposing sanctions over the country's nuclear program.

But his treatment also stirred debate over how far to go in treating someone so old, and making risky decisions that can save lives.   A1    Pork Projects Cost Seats  A timeworn bit of political wisdom has been that larding one's district with pork projects can act as an incumbency protection program, and the Republican leaders in Congress ardently followed that principle.

B7    NEW YORK/REGION B1-6    NYU Fund-Raising Efforts Grow Increasingly Complex  John Sexton, president of New York University, is heading an increasingly elaborate campaign to bring in $2.5 billion, including development teams and marketers who scour for every graduate with money.

Test Consent  A yearlong effort by New York City's health commissioner to do away with a state requirement that patients give their written consent before being tested for H.I.V. has created a sharp rift among doctors and advocates for people with H.I.V. and AIDS.  B1    Town Is Center of Deaf Life  Rochester, N.Y., is home to the nation's largest deaf population per capita, with about 90,000 people who are deaf or hard of hearing living in its metropolitan area.

C1    Silence on Stock Options  Jim Balsillie, the chairman of Research In Motion, creator of the BlackBerry, has yet to comment on the review of R.I.M.'s past stock options grants.

Right now at the Hudson River Museum in Yonkers are two summer shows that are charming and easy to digest, if perhaps somewhat deficient in solid esthetic nourishment.\\n\\nThe more ambitious of them, which will be on view through Sept. 5, is ''Art Materialized: Selections From the Fabric Workshop.'' The show is being circulated widely in this country and Canada through April 1984 by Independent Curators, a New York City organization, and its curator is Michael A. Quigley, the director of the Fabric Workshop of Philadelphia. Founded in 1977, the workshop is a group of master craftsmen, their assistants and students who over the years have worked with about 80 artists in residence, most of whom are known for their work in other media, with the goal, as Mr. Quigley puts it, of creating ''a new form of American art.''

Most street trees are planted in disturbed soils that have poor drainage. Verticillium wilt is encouraged by poor drainage, and the London plane, having inherited a preference for well-drained soils from its Oriental ancestors, is weakened and made more susceptible to anthracnose. The condition is aggravated by overwatering.

Saudi Arabia, the world's second-largest oil producer, has imported 8 million barrels of diesel and jet fuel to power the attack against Iraq. American forces guzzle gasoline faster than the rush-hour crowd on the Ventura Freeway","excerpt":"some tanks get only about 3,000    feet    to the gallon. The shortage comes not in crude oil, but in end products. \\"The quantities used are enormous and the refinery capacity is elsewhere,\\" said Robert G. Neumann, director of the Middle East program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a former Ambassador to Saudi Arabia. The situation is worse in Iraq, which has banned fuel sales to civilians. And in Kuwait, the Iraqis set wellheads and refineries on fire last week. Christopher Flavin, an energy specialist at the Worldwatch Institute, said it might take Kuwait five years to rebuild. In his view, the United States will be as vulnerable to energy shortages as ever in the coming decade. \\"Future crises are all but inevitable,\\" he said.    Those Embarrassing Oil Profits  They marked down assets likely to be sold. They reduced their earnings to account for environmental costs. But still, the oil companies had to admit that they had a darned good fourth quarter. Exxon's earnings tripled, Amoco's rose by more than two-thirds, Texaco's by more than one-third and Mobil's by nearly half. Their executives did their best to avoid celebrating or even cracking into smiles. Instead, they churned out press releases about how unlikely their strong earnings were to recur. Maybe so, given the volatility of oil prices. Still, what oil company wants to be caught profiting from the belligerence of Saddam Hussein?  Who's to Feed the Soviets?  Leningrad residents, startled to see chicken legs in the stores, call them    nozhki Busha    -- literally, legs of Bush -- assuming they came from the United States. But President Bush is under strong pressure from Congress to reduce assistance and postpone a summit meeting planned for next month. The European Parliament held up approval of $1 billion in food aid last week to protest Moscow's attack on independence groups in the Baltic republics. The United States has offered as much as $1 billion in credit guarantees for Soviet purchases of food. President Bush, relying on the Soviets to support his attack on Iraq, has so far shown little inclination to cut Soviet off food supplies at the legs. A Foreign Boost for Airlines  Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner has a new foreign aid program for the nation's airlines. On Wednesday, he announced that non-American carriers could buy as much as half the equity in United States airlines, up from 25 percent, as long as they held no more than 25 percent of the voting stock.  Mr. Skinner's ruling allows the Dutch airline KLM to keep its 49 percent interest in Northwest Airlines, acquired in a complicated transaction. Several of the nation's airlines, which lost an estimated $2 billion last year, are hungry for foreign capital. Whither the Price of Oil?  Iraqi missile attacks on Israel and apparent arson at Kuwaiti oil fields aroused second thoughts last week about whether oil should sell for less than $20 a barrel. After a dramatic fall to $19.25 during the week war broke out, prices stabilized and closed last week at $21.35. Soviet Ruble Recall  If wealth in the Soviet Union is almost a crime, then only criminals will have wealth. This, anyway, is one likely outcome of the sudden declaration last week that 50- and 100-ruble notes will become worthless except for the limited amounts that can be exchanged for smaller bills. Aides to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev argue that black marketeers have piled up their earnings in the higher denominations. But state workers, new entrepeneurs and the retired are the ones saving rubles. Most anyone who plays the black market has also found ways to convert rubles into dollars, stereos and jeans. Herbert S. Levine, a Soviet specialist at the University of Pennsylvania, called the ruble recall a bureaucratic mess, unlikely to shore up the currency's value as long as the Government keeps printing more money to paper over its budget deficits. \\"It's a confiscatory currency reform,\\" he said. Four Soviet republics, including Russia, challenged the plan by allowing more time for the exchange of large bills. THE ECONOMY   More Gloomy Numbers  The nation's output fell at an annual rate of 2.1 percent during the last quarter of 1990, the worst showing since 1982. The nine-tenths of 1 percent growth rate in the 1990 gross national product was also the worst in eight years. Economists were initially impressed -- many had feared worse, and a weak auto industry accounted for all of the quarter's decline. But then some remembered that Friday's figure is subject to revision. Alan C. Lerner, an economist at the Bankers Trust Company, said that other indicators have reflected \\"much more widespread weakness.\\" Another Bailout? The fund that insures bank deposits could be insolvent as early as next year and $23 billion in the red by 1995, the White House has said. The projection, in a budget request, raises the prospect of another huge taxpayer bailout. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is also likely to raise the premiums that banks pay to the fund. After three years of losses, the fund is already in its worst shape since it was created in 1934. Points of Light Grow Dim  Economists looking over statistics on charitable giving say that Americans have become less inclined to share their wealth. Reduced tax rates in the top brackets account for some of the stinginess, as the potential tax savings from charity diminish. But the gains in giving that were expected as Americans have grown wealthier since the 1950's have never materialized; contributions still represent about 2 percent of G.N.P. Republicans might point to over-reliance on the welfare state, while Democrats decry the other party's faith in enlightened self-interest. Edward O. Wilson, the sociobiologist, has noted that ants share food even when hungry; among Americans, plenty seems to merely create an appetite for more. Columbia Savings' Turn  Federal regulators seized the Columbia Savings and Loan Association, the industry's largest buyer of \\"junk bonds,\\" on Friday. The Beverly Hills institution, closely allied with Drexel Burnham Lambert and Michael Milken, bought more than $4 billion worth, now probably worth less than two-thirds as much. COMPANIES   General Cinema's Synergies Imagine the synergies that could result if the General Cinema Corporation, which controls Neiman Marcus, completes its acquisition of Harcourt Brace Jovanovich: When designers have a passion for purple, Neiman's could offer their fashions along with Alice Walker's most famous book. On a counter displaying chunky Mexican silver, the store could stack some novels by the Nobel laureate Octavio Paz. Analysts had thought that General Cinema was happier serving up Hollywood mayhem and mirth than the doings of Georges Simenon's Inspector Maigret. The $1.4 billion bid that Harcourt accepted on Thursday would rescue a publisher suffocating in debt. But some Harcourt bondholders might object to a deal giving them far less than full value. G. Heileman and Its Bondholders  Used to be that a bankruptcy filing was a company's last exit. But these days, it's more like a highway tollbooth. The G. Heileman Brewing Company asked for bankruptcy protection Thursday in a New York court often regarded as favorable to debtors. The company. based in Chicago, was inundated with debt when Alan Bond of Australia bought it out in 1987. Executives acted as giddy last week as if they had downed several six-packs of their Colt .45 and Carling's Black Label products. They announced plans to continue business as usual, with no layoffs, no production cuts, but the likely slaughter of their bondholders. As a spokesman boasted about the bankruptcy process, \\"This forces a negotiation with the unsecured bondholders so that a package can be wrapped up.\\"  Air Travel and the Free Market Up, up and away: Eastern Air Lines might be permanently grounded, but its competitors' fares are soaring. No more $158 round trips between New York and Florida; for some airlines, the price will go to $279. Other destinations in the South can cost more than a round trip from New York to London. \\"The loss of one or more airlines will not necessarily mean less competition,\\" Secretary of Transportation Samuel K. Skinner assured travelers last week. He explained that higher fares mean healthier airlines which mean more competition which just might mean better bargains in the long run. But so far, free, deregulated enterprise is working better in the abstract than in the air. Pepsico's Super Bowl Punt After a long huddle with the Federal Communications Commission, Pepsico Inc. decided to punt. The company dropped plans for a Super Bowl commercial that might have tangled the nation's telephone system. Pepsi had planned to flash a toll-free number, then give $1 million to each of three randomly chosen callers. Federal officials and telephone company executives warned that as many as 50 million would try to call. The resulting delays in completing other phone calls could slow the dispatch of fire engines, ambulances and police. \\"It would have been as if everyone in New York City decided to flush their toilets all at once,\\" said a spokesman for an association of local phone companies.

(It has the nation's second highest number of golf holes per capita, just behind Myrtle Beach, S.C.). But now Naples is starting to draw a younger, more dynamic crowd attracted to outdoorsy pursuits off the course, high-end shopping and late-night noshing -- all in a laid-back, upscale setting with enough cultural interest to support more than 130 art galleries and a symphony orchestra.   MEGHAN McEWEN    Friday    5 p.m.  1 -- Goodnight, Sun    Drop off your bags and head straight to Naples Pier in time for the sunset -- an impressive show that beckons tourists and Neapolitans alike","excerpt":"some tote lawn chairs and coolers to the beach below. Last rebuilt in 1960 and strong enough to withstand Hurricane Wilma in October, the landmark extends 1,000 feet over the Gulf of Mexico, which teems with snapper, grouper and shark. (Note the signs warning fishermen not to clean their fish over the water.) As you wait for the applause-generating daily masterpiece and watch the pelicans dive for their dinner, keep an eye out for the occasional dolphin.    7 p.m.  2 -- Tiger Vision    ''The wild is wilder after dark'' is the tag line for the Naples Zoo's most unusual attraction: a nighttime tour using night-vision goggles. During the roughly two-hour tour, said to be the only one of its kind in the United States, the zoo director, David Tetzlaff, will personally guide you past African wild dogs, tigers, porcupine pens, lion dens, antelopes and monkeys. Do plan: tours are given on select nights during the winter, and tickets ($70 a person) tend to sell out (1590 Goodlette-Frank Road, 239-262-5409).    9 p.m.  3 -- Naples, as in Italian    While much of Naples's sprawling commercial development takes the form of the ubiquitous Florida strip mall, it's a rare gem like Naples Tomato (14700 Tamiami Trail North, 239-598-9800) that does something different inside. Opened by two New Hampshire transplants, Jack and Nadine Serfass, this new warehouse -inspired Italian-American restaurant prepares sweet, chunky sauce from heirloom tomatoes harvested locally. Never will you feast on better lasagna ($18.95), and the alder wood-plank Everglades tilapia ($29.95), topped with grilled tomato and truffled balsamic vinaigrette, is local seafood at its best.    Saturday    10 a.m.  4 -- Be One With Nature    Only three years old, Naples Botanical Garden (4820 Bayshore Drive, 239-643-7275) is in the opening stages of grand plans to develop its 160 acres into a plant paradise. The focus now is on botanicals along the 26th latitude (where Naples is), like reptilian-looking climbing oleander from West Africa and giant squill from Zanzibar. Grab a colorful butterfly identification guide at the entrance to the butterfly pavilion and try to find each wing design as you walk through the screened-in area. If you're comfortable with critters, proceed to the sections dedicated to geckos and to brightly colored chirpy honeycreepers and lorikeets, birds that aren't afraid to land on shoulders -- especially Beeper, nicknamed for his ability to mimic cellphone rings.    1 p.m.  5 -- Under the Banyan Tree    With winter temperatures hovering from the mid-70's to the low 80's, alfresco dining is the thing among Naples's tanned socialites. There are dozens of places for it, often with heat lamps at tables for cooler evenings. But the best outdoor patio in town may be the rustic courtyard at Campiello (1177 Third Street South, 239-435-1166), with its giant banyan tree and a stone fountain. The lunch menu, featuring classic thin-crust pizzas fired to Neapolitan perfection in a wood oven ($12.50) as well as a muffuletta piled high with capicolla, mortadella, soppressata, salami and provolone ($12.50), won't disappoint.    3 p.m.  6 -- A Good Segue    Naples has its share of interesting historical tidbits, which you can encounter during Naples Water and Land Tours' new one-hour Segway Tour (1000 10th Avenue South at the Charter Club Resort, 239-793-7529; $50). You'll have a hoot zipping up and down the tree-lined streets while fascinated passersby honk and holler as the guide gives a general introduction to the downtown area. Starting near the City Docks and bypassing the main commercial avenues, you'll see ''cracker houses'' -- the late-19th-century cottages of the area's first white settlers -- and Tin City, an old maritime market that has grown into a touristy outpost peddling T-shirts, gator heads and coral necklaces. Don't be fooled by President Bush's Segway spill; the 15-minute introductory course beforehand has successfully trained participants ages 5 through 92.    4:30 p.m.  7 -- The Greenback District    Sure, there are brand-new Tiffany and Gucci stores at the Waterside Shops at Pelican Bay, and Hermès and Vuitton shops are on the way. But you may prefer to skip the chain stores for the boutiques and art galleries of Fifth Avenue South and Third Street South downtown. After all, Marissa Collections (1167 Third Street South, 239-263-4333) is a 10,000-square-foot bastion of luxury that sells an impeccable collection of Versace, Prada, Zac Posen, Derek Lam, Vera Wang, Miu Miu, you name it. Marissa Hartington, who opened the store 30 years ago with $500, still handpicks each piece, steadily expanding the ''boutique'' section of trendier, more affordable labels because of a younger clientele. If it's art you're interested in, Broad Avenue South goes by the moniker Gallery Row. Representing the likes of Milton Avery and Wolf Kahn, the Marianne Friedland Gallery (359 Broad Avenue South, 239-262-3484) stands out as a spare and serious modern and American contemporary gallery amid blocks of more ornate, decorative works and old masters.    8 p.m.  8 -- Not an Early Bird Special    If the late-night dinner crowds at trendy restaurants like Blu Sushi and Café & Bar Lurcat aren't convincing enough that there's a younger vibe in town, then make a reservation at Nektar (849 Seventh Avenue South, 239-435-1882). The ultrasleek bright-orange Mediterranean-style restaurant was opened last year by two Albanian brothers, Armand and Elton Alikaj, who moved from New York and London respectively. Start with the daily soup ($8) -- a zesty lentil on one visit -- or the watermelon salad ($12) sprinkled with red onions, fresh Greek feta and mint. Based on old family recipes (their mom is in the kitchen each day), the entrees range from a lusty pork stew over fresh vegetable couscous seasoned with Moroccan spices, raisins and sun-dried tomatoes ($22) to a slow-roasted lamb shank au jus with braised fennel and potato purée ($29).    Sunday    8 a.m.  9 -- Natural Habitat    The Naples area has nearly 20 miles of groomed beaches. But Delnor-Wiggins Pass State Park (11100 Gulfshore Drive, 239-597-6196) is different. It is one of the last remaining natural barrier-island beaches in Naples -- a one-mile stretch from which you won't see any tall buildings, and where the ungroomed sand is strewn with shells and seaweed. Get there early (official opening, 8 a.m.) for flawless sand dollars, lightning whelks and cockle shells. You can rent a kayak at the concession stand, Hurricane Charlie's (239-314-0110), for a full ($30) or half day ($20). Paddle through the peaceful estuaries and mangroves -- a haven for dolphins, sea turtles, shore and marsh birds, as well as manatee, often spotted feeding in the sea grass beds during winter.    Noon  10 -- Wacky Racers    Three weekends a year -- the first was late last month, the next is March 4 and 5 and then Oct. 28 and 29 -- scruffy racetrack regulars and V-neck-sweater-wearing Palm Beach types come together for some down-and-dirty fun at the Mile o' Mud at Florida Sports Park (8250 Collier Boulevard, 239-774-2701), the last legal place to watch swamp buggy races in the country. Loud, oversize and odd-looking buggies tear around a soupy track, spitting mud and dipping into mushy sink holes, while whooping fans, crowded onto rickety metal and wooden bleachers, go absolutely berserk. Every season, the lucky lass crowned Swamp Buggy Queen is dunked in the mud as part of the finale celebration.    THE BASICS  Where Night Owls Join Early Birds       Most major airlines fly into Southwest Florida International Airport in Fort Myers, and Delta flies into the Naples Municipal Airport, which serves mainly private jets. Either way, you'll want to rent a car for your stay.     The Ritz-Carlton, Naples (280 Vanderbilt Beach Road, 239-598-3300; www.ritzcarlton.com) is right on the beach, featuring 450 rooms, access to the Greg Norman-designed Tiburon golf courses, and an extravagant pool and deck area. Rooms are $249 to $1,049, starting at about $650 in peak season but dropping in the off-season.     The Inn on Fifth (699 Fifth Avenue South, 239-403-8777; www.innonfifth.com) is a charming boutique hotel in the heart of Old Naples. Its 87 rooms are $150 to $400, depending on season. 36 Hours in Naples, Fla."},{"year":"1962","title":"Those seeking conveyances to offshore fishing grounds need not despair of a shortage.
