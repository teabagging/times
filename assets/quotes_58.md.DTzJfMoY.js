In forewords which are personally delivered by Maryland's lame-duck Governor Lane and by Virginia's and North Carolina's Governors Battle and Scott, respectively, these eminent and honorable officials convey the solemn idea that what you are about to see is something that will prove to you how profitless crime is.And what you see is a conventional modern-day cops-and-robbers film, based on the dismal depredations of the so-called Tri-State gang, in which robbing and shooting and violence are exhibited for pure sensation's sake, with the gangsters annihilated in a juicy blood-bath at the end.Opening with the supposed robbery of a bank in Winston-Salem, N. C., by a gang of five sinister hoodlums, not one of whom would win a brain-test prize, this picture recounts their adventures in their escapes, their other crimes and with their \\"molls\\" through a series of ticklish moments, until the cops finally give them the works. Steve Cochran plays the gang leader, so he's the most arrogant of the mob, and Gaby Andre as a naive French-Canadian is the most sympathetic of the \\"molls.\\" As other gangsters, Robert Webber, Richard Egan and Wally Cassell are standard muggs, and Virginia Grey is acerbic as a \\"moll\\" who tries to play the game.However, the whole thing, concocted and directed by Andrew Stone, is a straight exercise in low sadism. And the reactions at the Strand yesterday among the early audience, made up mainly of muscular youths, might have shocked and considerably embarrassed the governors mentioned above.On the stage at the Strand are Dave Apollon and his company, Tommy Wonder, Peggy Mann, Lee Marx, Danny Capri and Florian Zabach and his band.

Campbell, Deputy Superintendent of Schools in New York City, \\"we would have said that the intelligence tests gave us a yardstick for discovering the attitudes and aptitudes of our pupils. We have found, however, so many cases of lack of correlation between these tests and achievement that few of us are willing to take them as sole guide.\\"Dr. Garry Cleveland Meyers of Western Reserve University at Cleveland, Ohio, was still more emphatic in opposition to the achievement tests generally in use.\\"As part of our fine machinery,\\" he said, \\"have come standard tests. From them we have learned a great deal about norms of achievement. Out of this testing movement have come some very definite gains, no doubt. Also have come some losses, some grave losses to the mental health and personality of the pupils.\\"The teacher has observed that most standard tests have two measures—speed and accuracy. She sets her pupils working against the stopwatch, so they must study and recite, and by the watch they are supposed to think.\\"Stop-watch drills will by and by be barred from the classroom as belonging to barbarity. Whereas those textbooks which today have speed drills on almost every other page are best sellers, they tomorrow will be relegated to the scrap heap. Two hundred years from now they will appear as curios in the museum alongside the torturing devices of the inquisitions.\\"Against the Next Depression.One important insurance policy against such depressions as the present would be the education of our citizens in personal and general economics, several speakers at the National Education Association convention held. Mrs. Edith Nourse Rogers, Congresswoman from Massachusetts, for instance, urged making our children in the public schools \\"budget-conscious and budget-conscientious.\\"\\"The major economic corrections for which modern civilization is calling,\\" declared Lee Galloway, vice chairman of the board of the Alexander Hamilton Institute, \\"lie in the system itself. These changes depend upon the people as a whole and not the business men alone. That is the reason why every citizen should know certain business facts, be aware of economic tendencies and trained in evaluating social relationships growing out of business activities.\\"Training in these concepts should begin early, and the young prospective citizen should be thoroughly oriented in his economic environment, and through this with social life generally, by the end of his junior high school course.\\"\\"We can no longer afford to ignore commercial education and treat it as a poor stepchild of academic education, if a recurrence of the present world-wide economic depression is to be prevented,\\" asserted Dr. John Robert Gregg, president of the American Society for Commercial Education.

PETER FRIEDMAN Dear Diary:   A Long Island Rail Road train stops at Freeport, and a 20-something couple get on and sit beside me. He has a resonant voice and is relating his life story and his philosophy of life, including a lot of pop-psych jargon. I become engrossed in my book and shut out his voice. But as the train leaves Jamaica, he begins to expound on women, saying that they are essentially inferior and need male guidance, that they really can't function without male assistance.   I close my book and glance across the aisle and make eye contact with another woman. We both roll our eyes and communicate wordlessly as the diatribe goes on. When the train slows for Penn Station and everyone stands up, I turn to him and say, \\"You know nothing about women!\\" Spontaneous applause -- the car is full of women.   The train stops. He races to the door, and just before it opens, he leans into the car and shouts, \\"You are all in denial!\\" VERA MEYERSON Spotted by C. Wetter of Stamford, Conn. in local newspaper of Sedona, Ariz.:   A SEDONA FIRST  In response to recent proclamations from the offices of the Attorney General, we are proud to announce that for the health of your loved ones, all of our caskets are smoke-free.   Sedona Funeral Home Dear Diary:   I've seen a number of odd sights in my daily walks from the Staten Island Ferry to my office at the World Financial Center -- a gaggle of French and Japanese tourists dancing the hokeypokey while waiting to board the Miss Liberty; a crowd of lethargic Wall Street types lounging around the Battery Park benches (they turned out to be movie extras) -- but nothing beats the sight I saw at the Battery Park City esplanade on a recent June morning.   There was the usual sprinkling of early morning strollers, dog walkers and joggers. Then, I suddenly realized that a rather large animal was galloping toward me at full speed from the north end of the esplanade. It was a New York City police horse in full patrol gear, sans police officer. I and a security guard moved out of harm's way and stared in stunned silence as the chestnut-colored animal ran past us, heading toward the south end of the esplanade.   Apparently making a last-minute, but wise, decision not to charge headlong into the wisteria gazebo, and thence into the drink, the horse made a sharp left, hind legs slipping and sliding and raising a cloud of dust. Then it disappeared, heading in the general direction of the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel and perhaps onward to greener pastures somewhere out on Long Island.   I turned to look back in the direction the runaway horse had come from and saw two more police horses approaching -- riders attached -- in hot pursuit. From this vantage point, of course, the runaway could not be seen. The first cop looked at us questioningly. I couldn't resist. I pointed and yelled, \\"He went that-a-way!\\" MARIANNE SCARINO Metropolitan Diary"},{"year":"1946","title":"It was evident early in the evening that no one would be crushed in the rush for tickets at the Stadium last night.

Opera    ''CAPRICCIO,'' Metropolitan Opera. Richard Strauss's last opera, ''Capriccio,'' which received its premiere at the Munich National Theater in 1942, in the depths of World War II, is a curiosity that Strauss himself called a ''conversation piece.'' Its rather talky libretto is by the composer and his friend and champion, the conductor Clemens Krauss. Set in Paris during the 1780's, the story tells of the widowed Countess Madeleine, who is being courted by two suitors, a composer and a poet. The rivalry frames a wry aesthetic debate about which art holds priority, words or music, when they are combined. Still, the opera is strangely engrossing, and has some glorious musical moments, including the countess's final scene, which is autumnal Strauss at his most rapturously beautiful. The soprano Kiri Te Kanawa, who will sing the role in the Met's first production of the opera, would seem ideally suited to it. Andrew Davis conducts.

In the Tulane Drama Review some years ago, John J. Sullivan, a psychologist with an interest in the theater, argued that the starting of the MAT and Freud's book were responses and contributions to certain radically changed conditions of the European mind: a new consciousness of the self, especially of its interiority, and a new awareness of the relations between body and mind. On the basis of these intuitions, Freud embarked on a ''scientific'' revision of nearly all human self-knowledge","excerpt":"Stanislavsky's goals were more modest and circumscribed, but the results of his investigations in his chosen domain nevertheless proved to be far-reaching.   A few months ago, Lee Strasberg died after a long reign as head of the Actors' Studio and an even longer one as Stanislavsky's chief interpreter (or, as some think, misinterpreter) in this country.

With all due respect to the agile cameraman of the Baku Feature and Newsreel Studio, and a herculean construction job, this supposedly objective film suffers throughout from a pedestrian format and a shrill, blatant tone of triumph.\\"A Kingdom on the Waters,\\" an hour-length study of wild life in the lake district of SouthHungary, is a miniature masterpiece of its kind, and we're not forgetting Mr. Disney's best. Produced in Agfacolor by the Hungarian Newsreel and Documentary Film Studios, this remarkable little film follows the survival struggle and seasonal habits of some seventy types of creatures with closest attention accorded the birds.Credit must go to Dr. Istvan Homoki Magy, the writer-director-photographer, for a technical brilliance that denotes patience and pluck, and particularly for a simple gravity of approach to his subject, minus a single overtone of condescension or roguishness.Consequently, even the intramura terror besetting the loveliness of the windswept, reedy marshes seems a cruelty in keeping with the poetical flow of life itself and certainly Dr. Magy's unpretentiously fluent camera. Without a set plot or any \\"star\\" creatures, the film sustains a fascinating unity in its glimpses of cuckoos, gray reed-walkers, red-bill ducks, herons and egrets. And towering over such marauders as the otter, polecat, bat and fox are two magnificent species of eagle.In addition to some uncanny underwater scenes showing the evolution of a frail polyp to a carnivorous diving beetle, Dr. Magy goes one better with an actual close-up of a damaged common tern egg embryo pulsating its last.Let us hope we haven't heard the last of Dr. Magy. Excluding one tricked-up sequence about a nest of field mice, he has turned out an exceptionally good and authentic work. Quietly and meticulously, he has gone straight to nature itself, instead of the other way around.
