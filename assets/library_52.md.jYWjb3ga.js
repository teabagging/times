Ballet in this country had been the province of Russian (or Russian-named) ballerinas who espoused a style that would seem theatrically artificial today. There were some, like John Martin, dance critic of The New York Times, who felt initially that American dance was modern dance and that ballet represented a regression to what might now be called ''old Europe.''    Yet from the beginning Balanchine and Kirstein were determined to form a truly American ballet company. American girls, wrote Kirstein, ''were not sylphides","excerpt":"they were basketball champions and queens of the tennis court, whose proper domain was athletics. They were long-legged, long-necked, slim-hipped and capable of endless acrobatic virtuosity.''

But destinations have been in decline these last few decades, at least as a subject for the imagination. \\"On the Road,\\" \\"Easy Rider,\\" these were about leaving, not about arriving.In \\"Kings of the Road,\\" by the West German director Wim Wenders, there is nothing but the road, or a series of roads. They run through the North German plain, overcast most of the time, with fog and rain erupting continually and with a sunlight that manages to look dark. The world, whether as a point of departure or a destination, has all but finished—the road remains as a kind of Limbo of our time.\\"Kings,\\" which is being shown today and tomorrow at the New York Film Festival and will open Tuesday at the Embassy 72d Street Theater, focuses upon two citizens of the road, one permanent and one temporary.The first is Bruno, who makes his home in a moving-van and drives from town to town fixing the projectors in the local movie house. He is loose, sleepy, shrewd, good-humored and totally unattached. He longs for women, is attractive to them, but lacks the power of concentration—permanent or temporary—to settle on any particular one.Bruno has accepted aimlessness and unattachment. He drives through the dour countryside and visits the dour towns, whose streets are virtually unpopulated and whose gas stations seem to be always closed. It's not that aimlessness doesn't hurt him: It does, but so deeply that he doesn't show it.He has, in fact, only one commitment: to the proper projection of motion pictures and the proper maintenance of the machinery. It is a solitary ideal; the projectionists he deals with are slipshod and indifferent, and more and more villages are are shutting their cinemas down.Bruno has withdrawn from the world, then, or perhaps it is the other way around. Into his solitude, propelled at full speed, comes a temporary refugee, Robert. Robert is an intellectual who engages actively with society—he studies children's speech—but his recent encounters have been shattering. His wife has left him, for example.Two meet, comically: Robert, full of anger and distraction, drives his car into a lake by mistake and it sinks. Bruno and his van are parked nearby. They join forces.It is a long, slow, wandering they embark upon. Robert becomes Bruno's assistant. He can't face his own world, for the time being: but every time he spots a telephone he tries to call his wife, and every time he sees a newspaper on the ground he reads it.There are a series of encounters in which each, in his own way, enacts the difficulty of communication. Bruno spends a night with the cashier of a movie house. There is a lovely tenderness, but all he can do, literally, is sleep with her.Robert visits his father, editor of a small newspaper, and tries to speak of his childhood resentments. But he can't get the words out so finally, as the old man sleeps at his desk, the son goes to work on the linotype. By morning, he has printed a two-page denunciation of his father's treatment of his mother. He finishes, hands the pages to his father; they embrace delicately and part.Eventually, Robert goes back. His nature is to commit himself, even to an imperfect, half-dead world. He takes a train, that most constrained and committed form of transportation. Bruno, the idealist, wanders on in his lumpy van, whose mournful pace and elephantine presence make a lovely unifying symbol for the film.It needs one badly. \\"Kings\\" is often fascinating. It has a number of compelling and witty scenes, and its imagery is harshly apt. But it is three hours long, which is at least an hour too much; and its successes are scattered like meager raisins through a mass of gray dough.It moves like silence and sleep, and with a great parsimony of things to look at. Nothing happens but what is happening, and it happens one thing at a time, and one or two people at a time. Our peripheral vision is starved, and we are ready to take the train some time before Robert does.

He spoke recently with Joel Topcik about what he's listening to and why:    Bun B       The rap duo UGK (Underground Kingz), from Port Arthur, Tex., were pioneers that a lot of kids from the South like me looked up to but that never got their proper shine. They've been around for well over 10 years","excerpt":"they were on Jay-Z's ''Big Pimpin' '' in 1999 and all of a sudden the world was acting like they were a new group. I'm proud to see Bun B, half of the duo, carrying the torch with his album ''Trill'' (Rap-a-Lot). You get that Texas sound, the Southern pride in the lyrics, especially on a song like ''Draped Up.'' It has grungy beats with a vocal sample from the legendary Texas rapper Lil' Keke, and Bun B just spits flames over it.    Eurythmics       Listening to the new Eurythmics compilation, ''The Ultimate Collection'' (Arista), brought back a lot of memories of growing up and hearing them and other acts we all saw on MTV and ''Video Jukebox'' -- the Police, A-Ha, Pat Benatar. But it's not just nostalgia; songs like ''Here Comes the Rain Again'' and ''Sweet Dreams'' are classics. I tried to sample ''Sweet Dreams,'' but the band didn't clear it. That's business; it's their choice, and I'm still a fan. But it reminds me that as a producer, it's important for kids now to know where the samples they're listening to came from.    Alicia Keys       Some people listen to ''unplugged'' albums looking for a flaw in the music. When I listen, I'm looking for a person's ability to recreate the way they felt when they wrote a particular song or when they recorded it or when they were going through the emotion behind it. When you're unplugged, it's about your spirit, your willingness to make a mistake and let it all out. I hear all that on ''Alicia Keys Unplugged'' (J). It shows her pure talent, vocally and in terms of musicianship. And then there's the fact that it's jammin'. Let's just say that about Alicia Keys: she's talented and jammin'.    Grout       I was at a concert recently sponsored by the Atlanta rock station 99X, and I saw a local rock group called Grout. One of the problems I have with a lot of young R&B and rock groups is their lack of lyricism. For me it's all about evoking emotion. When I heard Grout, I was impressed with the singer; I could hear the pain and sincerity in his voice, and the depth in the lyrics. It reminded me of the first time I heard Kurt Cobain. I've heard they're in the studio and shopping for a label.    Penelope       I heard a demo by a rapper named Penelope while I was working in the studio. She's out of St. Louis and is about to release an album on Universal early this year. I think she's going to be the next female voice in rap. She's lived what she's speaking about -- things she's been through on the streets, the struggles of urban life. Some artists are either very street or very commercial, and she has a little of both: street cuts as well as ones that cross over to radio. It's a good time for St. Louis thanks to the doors that Nelly and Chingy and J-Kwon were able to open. There's a swing and a swagger to St. Louis rap, and Penelope definitely has that.    Scar       This is a young R&B singer from Mississippi who Big Boi from OutKast signed to his label, Purple Ribbon. I heard him recently when I started doing work in Big Boi's studio in Atlanta, and you can hear him on ''Big Boi Presents Got Purp? Vol. 2,'' the new compilation that Virgin put out last month. He and Big Boi do a song called ''U Got Me.'' This dude has so much soul; you can't believe he's only 21, 22 years old. And the lyricism is there. You'd think he was a young Curtis Mayfield.

Yet, here is a film to knot the fist and seize the heart with anger, a film that stings like a slap in the face of complacence, a scourge and lash against the delusion that there may still be an easy way out. Here is a film to lift the spirit with the courage of a people who have gone all-out. Among the documents of great battles—we did not witness Stallings's \\"The First World War\\"—we have not seen a film to equal it.For this is a record of things that the impartial eye of the camera can tell best and words but inadequately describe. The grief, the hope and determination of these faces at work and in desperate battle are not easily reduced to a phrase. Nor can one readily define the transition of a people into the deepest necessities of total war. The festive marchers blithely parading across Red Square in a great sports demonstration are the same who on another day stand in massed ranks before Lenin's tomb to hear Marshal Timoshenko's warning to be ready for battle. They are the same who on Nov. 7, four months after the Nazi invasion, stand grimly in the snowy expanse of the square listening to Stalin's speech before moving in tank and truck or afoot directly from the parade ground for the fighting front. A change, deep and visible, has occurred between those three assemblies, and the camera tells it.Here is the preparation for the counter-stroke while in Moscow the old men and women and children build sandbag barricades and streetcars pass the muzzles of cannon commanding the avenues; here are the people who said: \\"If we are defeated or the outskirts we will stop them in the streets.\\" Here are the attack and the succeeding attacks as white-clad soldiers and parachutists charge into villages past shell-bursts and burning tanks or take-cities street by street, ferreting sullen Germans from cellars and foxholes. Here are the littered vehicles and cannon and tanks of the German retreat.The savagery of that retreat is a spectacle to stun the mind. The villages are not villages but charred honeycombs of little low walls that once were houses, schools, or even cathedrals. But infinitely more terrible are the charnel heaps of twisted grotesques that no longer resemble human beings, the naked and slaughtered children stretched out in ghastly rows, the youths dangling limply in the cold from gallows that were rickety, but strong enough. Among them wander the living mothers, their faces set in friezes of grief, and sometimes a Red Army soldier gazing on the broken bodies with a silence like flame. The Germans called it policy. They also had another word: \\"Shrecklichkeit.\\"To say that \\"Moscow Strikes Back\\" is a great film is to fall into inappropriate cliché. As a documentary it has been brilliantly edited by Slavko Vorkapich, tersely written by Albert Maltz and movingly spoken by Edward G. Robinson, but that does not tell the story of what the heroic cameramen have done. Amid the fury of battle they have caught and arrested for the embattled peoples of these years the greatness of effort, the sheer greatness of heart of the people that stopped the Wehrmacht's panzers on that fateful day of Dec. 6 and closed the gates of Moscow to the Nazi tide. What that moment meant in the strategy of nations history alone will tell, but what it meant in terms of human beings rising to a tremendous climax of sacrifice and blood and heroism \\"Moscow Strikes Back\\" has told overwhelmingly and irrevocably for all time to come.

Neither was a self-declared innovator.

He enjoyed offering perverse data: ''I'm a bourgeois realist who writes in order to find out what he thinks. My ancestors, as far as my work is concerned, were a mixed bunch: Job, Shakespeare's Richard II, King Solomon, the Marx Brothers, Charlie Chaplin, the Keystone Cops.''\\n\\nThe media quickly pinned labels on these two independent, quirky spirits.

In a recent recording for London, he tempted consumers with the later symphonies of Mozart, concealing orchestral works of Webern at the end of each CD. At a Carnegie Hall concert on Monday night with the Cleveland Orchestra, Bruckner's Fifth Symphony was the lure, Schoenberg's Five Pieces for Orchestra the catch. The conductor presents these scores with such care and grace that audiences usually drop their natural resistance.         In fact, Mr. Dohnanyi's rendition of the Schoenberg was in many ways the more relaxed and sensuously appealing performance of the evening.  The central movement, \\"Farben,\\" or \\"Colors,\\" dissolved into a hypnotizing haze of sonorities, with no unwanted breaks in the flow of sound.  The fierce fortissimos of the outer movements had a shiny brilliance, like the glare of the midday sun.

Recent Britpop tends to be constrained and disenchanted, trying to hold onto some pomp but seeing only shrunken horizons. Elbow has made a career of trying to reconcile those thoroughly contradictory impulses, and the band keeps getting better at it. Its third album, ''Leaders of the Free World'' (V2), keeps the stately melodies. But now Elbow adds some Blur to its evocations of Genesis and Pink Floyd. Which is to say that some guitars have taken on an edge, and the swelling choruses and pretty passages of layered instruments don't even try to conceal the songs' raging insecurity.    The Green Arrows       In the 1970's, when Zimbabwe was Rhodesia, the Green Arrows were one of the country's top bands","excerpt":"they were the first to release a full-length LP, in 1976. The exuberant compilation ''4-Track Recording Session'' (Analog Africa/Alula) includes that album plus 10 songs from 1974 to 1979. Four-track tape neatly captured grooves that drew on local six-beat Shona rhythms, the bounce of South African rock, even a reggae song in English (about ''Towering Inferno,'' of all things). The band is perpetually crisp, and its staccato precision brilliantly offsets whichever voice or instrument is allowed to wander freely amid the patterns, especially when the lead guitarist unleashes imported technology: a wah-wah pedal the South African producer brought from Johannesburg. Translations of the songs, which occasionally got the band in political trouble during Zimbabwe's war for independence, are all that's missing.    New York Noise Vol. 2       Funk, punk, minimalism, free jazz, African drumming, electronic collage, early hip-hop and an insolence bordering on hostility added up to some quintessential New York rock in the late 1970's and early 80's. The songs on the no-wave compilation ''New York Noise Vol. 2'' (Soul Jazz), resurrected from tiny local labels, are mostly one-idea tracks -- a riff (Red Transistor's ''Not Bite''), a beat (Jill Kroesen's ''I Am Not Seeing That You Are Here''), a rigorous guitar squall (Rhys Chatham's ''Drastic Classicism'') -- but a lot of those ideas still have teeth.    Centro-Matic       Will Johnson may be the only rock songwriter ever to use the word eleemosynary (which means charitable), as he does on Centro-Matic's new album, ''Fort Recovery'' (Misra). Sung in his hoarse, battered voice, with a backdrop of fuzz-toned guitars, it sounds just as unaffected as his blunter declarations, like, ''You are correct, we are wrecked.'' Centro-Matic is steeped in the feedback-edged trudge of Neil Young's Crazy Horse, though it also has gentler moments. Either way, it provides a roots-rock grounding for lyrics that can be cryptic or painfully open. In his songs, Mr. Johnson sounds as if he has seen enough troubles to make him wary of everyone -- but not enough to make him stop trying to connect. Hear the album free at www.misrarecords.com/fortrecovery.asp.    Richard Leo Johnson       The sounds of an old steel-bodied National Duolian guitar enthralled Richard Leo Johnson, who has been recording his acoustic guitar pieces since the early 1990's. On ''The Legend of Vernon McAlister'' (Cuneiform), Mr. Johnson revels in the Duolian's metallic tone, its resonances, its sharp plinks and its capacity to slide and sustain. The pieces he overdubbed often draw on folky picking patterns, but those down-home materials can be enveloped in eerie near-electronic wails, quasi-orchestral surges and spiky percussive sounds -- all made with just that steel guitar. It sounds as if Mr. Johson has glimpsed the Duolian's haunted inner life. Selections and an apocryphal tale about the name scratched into the guitar are at www.vernonmcalister.com.    Trespassers William       To unnerve an audiophile, just play ''Having'' (Nettwerk), the third studio album by the Los Angeles band Trespassers William, on a high-end stereo system. Then watch the panicky response to the distortion that fogs nearly every instrument sooner or later. Everything's a little bleary on ''Having.'' It's an album of slow-motion songs from the general vicinity of Mazzy Star and Portishead, with a streak of Aimee Mann. Anna-Lynne Williams sings as if she has been awake far too long. Her anger and tears have almost given way to resignation, and her accusations are quiet but unflinching. They arrive in melodies that stay calmly focused within the shadowy half-light of the music.    Gospel Music       The no-frills title and packaging of ''Gospel Music'' (Hyena) reflect the straightforwardness of this concise but first-rate compilation. In old recordings that sound extraordinarily vivid, big names (Mahalia Jackson, the Soul Stirrers, the Staple Singers, the Swan Silvertones) tear into church standards. The album is full of bluesy guitars and voices that share close harmonies before leaping toward solo ecstasies. The wild, syncopated call-and-response of the Angelic Gospel Singers and the Dixie Hummingbirds in the finale of ''One Day'' is just one peak on an album that makes spirituality deeply physical.

A majority of boomers, who once defined themselves as the youth in youth culture, have found themselves on the other side of a rock generation gap, wondering how kids can listen to that godawful racket and why they have such weird haircuts. They hear  singers who bawl constantly, lyricists who use profanities as punctuation, guitarists who spew noise, hip-hop tracks built on sonic irritants.

Two years ago he startled readers with ''Riddley Walker,'' a haunting portrayal of life in a post-Armageddon landscape. Now, in ''Pilgermann,'' the scene shifts dramatically from imagined future to historical past, but the harrowing vision remains essentially unchanged. The world according to Pilgermann is a brutish place where bodies are boiled and devoured and human heads are used as cannonballs.

But it thinks better of it and the puppets go about their silly antics, creating an occasional chuckle. The fun in this film is not particularly original. Much is made of a queerly darned stocking, and perhaps even more than the usual amount of footage is devoted to kissing. Jenny Lou and John Blaisdell forget all about the sunshine, the rough and fairway, when they meet on the golf course, and it seems as though they were oblivious to the presence of others while in each other's arms. What makes their conduct all the more singular is the fact that John has a devoted wife. As E. Mason Hopper more or less ingeniously draws this cardboard character, John has no powers of resistance when two brown eyes cross his horizon. John is married to a blond, and that young woman is impersonated by Phyllis Haver, who hitherto has confined her talents to portraying dizzy creatures who cause divorces.In this film there is the familiar idea of a wife letting her husband know that what't sauce for the gander is sauce for the goose. Through the beneficence of Mr. Hopper, Helen Blaisdell is permitted to devote her attention to Jenny Lou's Southern fiancé, and thus she evens matters up with her husband and also the brunette.Miss Haver does quite well by her part, and Jacqueline Logan is attractive as the fickle Jenny Lou.

Elements of the style have been absorbed into mainstream culture, from the prefabricated rips in the knees of Gap jeans to Sinead O'Connor's skinhead hairdo. But punk itself no longer exists as a distinct genre, and icons of the punk-rock movement, like Iggy Pop and the band Social Distortion, are having to adapt themselves in order to stay musically vital. Both Mr. Pop and Social Distortion will perform in Manhattan halls this weekend.    Mr. Pop, who will appear at the Academy, is something of a legend, with a 21-year recording history behind him. The high-volume frenzy and violent stage antics of his first band, the Stooges, active in Detroit from the late 60's until 1974, influenced not only the punk explosion of the late 70's, but also a whole new generation of noise-rockers like Sonic Youth in the 80's, as well as current heavy-metal stars.

TOP STORIES    KOMMERSANT  MOSCOW CANCELS NATIONALIST MARCH: Moscow authorities on Thursday denied permission for several nationalist groups to hold what has become a yearly demonstration called the Russian March. An official from the Moscow government said that the route march organizers proposed was not appropriate for such an event. Last year's gathering, during which some marchers chanted ''Heil Hitler'' and made Nazi salutes, stoked fears about an eruption of neo-Nazism in Russia. One of the march organizers said that ''the march will be held in any case, even if it leads to confrontation.''    QUOTAS SET FOR MOSCOW MARKETS: Moscow's municipal government has announced that it will guarantee Russian farmers, as opposed to those from abroad, access to at least 50 percent of the city's food markets. Moscow's mayor, Yuri Luzhkov said that the quota system would help eliminate the middleman, and at the same time fulfill President Vladimir V. Putin's directive to ''terminate the lawlessness in markets.'' Experts, however, were sure that the quota would be ineffective and suggested it would be better to go after the markets' ''shadowy proprietors.''    APPEALS DROPPED IN SYCHYOV CASE: Lawyers for Aleksandr V. Sivyakov, the Russian sergeant sentenced for the infamous beating of Private Andrei S. Sychyov, and Mr. Sychyov's lawyers have agreed to retract their appeals and to halt further contestation of Mr. Sivyakov's four-year prison sentence. Lawyers for Mr. Sivyakov said they worried that their client would receive a harsher sentence if they pursued the appeal. Mr. Sychyov's sister said that Mr. Sivyakov was just a scapegoat. She said she was more concerned about the fates of the officers at the Chelyabinsk tank institute where the two soldiers were stationed.    VEDOMOSTI  CLEANING UP THE TAX SERVICE: Russia's Federal Tax Service has certified a new program to battle corruption in its ranks following several high-profile scandals. In 2005, the Justice Ministry opened 252 criminal cases against the service for corruption. As part of the new program, tax officials will be subject to video monitoring and lie detector tests","excerpt":"they will be paid for informing on colleagues; and their wages will be tripled. In addition, officials will rotate frequently to new work places and will be allowed minimal contact with businessmen.    GAZETA  KICK THE GEORGIANS OUT: A survey conducted by a Russian polling agency from Oct. 14--17 found that 38 percent of Russia's population would ''support the deportation of all Georgians, even those with Russian citizenship.'' In addition, 56 percent of Russians feel that the United States was behind Georgia's arrest of Russian officers a month ago. Sociologists blame these sentiments on anti-Georgian propaganda in the largely state-controlled media.    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA  MAYORAL CANDIDATE MURDERED IN THE FAR EAST: A candidate for mayor from the United Russia party was shot and killed in the waiting room of his office on Thursday in the far-eastern city of Dalnegorsk. The murder occurred three days before the second round of mayoral elections following a near tie in voting held Oct. 8. United Russia called the killing a criminal attack on the entire party. The governor of the Primorye region, where Dalnegorsk is located, promised to take personal control of the investigation.    IZVESTIA  CHECHEN FIGHTERS WILL PROTECT ABKHAZIA: Chechnya's president on Thursday promised to send volunteer forces to protect the unrecognized Republic of Abkhazia in the case of an attack by Georgia. He said, however, that he hoped the ''wise Georgian people would prevent their leadership from going to war.'' He also said that if an outside force were to attack Georgia, Chechnya would also come to its aid out of a sense of Caucasus solidarity.    NOVYE IZVESTIA  MEDICAL TOURISM BOOMING IN RUSSIA: More and more Russians are going abroad for their medical needs. The newspaper wrote that because Russians trust foreign specialists more than Russian doctors, many go abroad not just for complicated surgeries, but also for simple checkups and dentist visits. Russian doctors, however, advised that patients consult with them before seeing foreign practitioners, warning that even a simple massage could cause irreparable harm.

Not only is German spoken by all the members of the German cast, which sounds a little outlandish in the literal Paris locale, but the tone is distinctly Teutonic, being scrupulously sensible and moral, and the ending is over-sentimental—not at all what a French ending would be.But once this fact is realized, that Herr Kautner is telling a tale of two lonely young lovers in Paris with all the weltschmerz of a Bonn expatriate, then the charm of this little boy-girl romance, which came to the Seventy-second Street Playhouse yesterday, may be properly classified according to character and enjoyed for what it is.Actually, Herr Kautner has protected his attic romance to the extent that he has made his young man, played by Horst Buchholz, an exile from Hungary. He, the \\"monpti\\" of the title—that's a contraction of \\"mon petit,\\" a sweetheart's term—is a clearly reliable, punctilious and not too imaginative middle-European. Thus when he meets a Paris maiden in the Jardin du Luxembourg and finally gets her up to his garret bedroom, you may be sure he is going to behave.And, indeed, you may feel fairly certain that this young lady, who Romy Schneider plays, is not going to act like one of those genuine French girls played by a Francoise Arnoul or Brigitte Bardot.Although she may flirt with her fellow in a bewitchingly agitating way, and even take off her clothes, at one rare point, and offer to model for him (we should have told you he is an artist), she will go no further than that. Neither she nor he is indecorous. (See, we told you, they're not very French).But this is the theme of the story and the bitter-sweet essence of its charm—against the beautiful background of old Paris, two hungering young lovers dare not consummate their love. They will kiss in the shadows of old doorways, on the steps of the quais along the Seine","excerpt":"they will even try to drop their inhibitions in the uncongenial clutter of his room. But they can't. She is pure and he is decent. She tries to fancy themselves serenely wed. Her small deceptions annoy and confuse him. They often quarrel and make up. That's how it goes.And, in going, it takes us with it, around Paris, which looks mellow and cool, in beautifully modulated colors; into restaurants and cabarets, where Herr Kautner works a secondary romance that is supposed to be contrastingly chic and consequently ironic, but is a little too studied to be good; and finally it takes us, full of wanting, into an icy hospital and to an unnecessarily brutal ending that only a high-minded German would pull.However, it pleases up to this point, and it is most attractively played by Herr Buchholz, who is unlawfully good-looking, and Fraeulein Schneider, who is a pert Maria Schell. They act with gracefulness and fervor, making it easy to believe that they are passionate about each other but restrained by a subtle sense of morals.Mara Lane and Boy Golbert are synthetic as the lovers on a higher social plane and Olive Moorefield makes a gaudy seductress in the role of a chambermaid.The German dialogue is translated with English subtitles, except when Herr Kautner comes in as a philosophical observer and narrator. He speaks in English. It's very Germanic but not too germane.

The answer given to Secretary Heckler: ''No, the number of children served by Medicaid is expected to increase by 558,000 by the end of 1985 as compared to 1981.'' The 700,000 poor children who lost needed health care coverage are not the same as the 558,000 children who will be added back by 1985. The estimate of 700,000 children removed from Medicaid was given to us by department officials in late 1982. These were the children who lost both A.F.D.C. (Aid to Families With Dependent Children) and Medicaid benefits as a result of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act passed by Congress in the summer of 1981 at the urging of the Administration.  In other words, the Administration changed the rules of welfare programs in 1981 to eliminate 700,000 children from A.F.D.C. and Medicaid.  Because of increasing child poverty, however, Medicaid rolls are growing again, even though eligibility rules are more restrictive.

The other units will rent for $850 to $1,000 a month. \\n\\nA new two-story, red-brick office building is going up next to the three-story Lithgow building on the 45,000-square-foot triangular site. The two will be joined by a common entry lobby and have retail space on the ground floor. A parking lot for 40 cars is going in across the street. So far, 60 percent of the offices are leased.\\n\\nOver the last 20 years, Dorchester underwent severe economic decline and is now being revived with substantial government assistance. In the last five years, $52.5 million in private, city and state funds has been invested in building and rehabilitating 500 units of rental and for-sale housing and more than 100,000 square feet of commercial space in Codman Square, said Patrick J. McGuigan, the city's deputy development director. The keystone to the endeavor, most of which has been completed, is the Lithgow block.\\n\\nFor 16 years, city government promises to buy the block and move the work forward were not realized. It was not until 1985, under the current Mayor, Raymond L. Flynn, that the city acquired the site through tax foreclosure. \\n\\nThe land was sold by the city for $1 to the Codman Square Housing Development Corporation, a locally based nonprofit entity headed by Alyce Lee. The corporation is getting construction financing from the city ($2 million), the state ($2.3 million) and the Bank of Boston ($1.4 million). Trinity Financial, a local financial services company, is raising the rest from investors taking advantage of tax credits for historic restoration.\\n\\nWhen the project is completed, the development corporation will convert its construction loans into a permanent mortgage from the Massachusetts Housing Finance Agency. The payments will come from commercial and residential rents, subsidized under state and Federal rent-assistance programs.

Stephen James, an owner of the dairy in Ancramdale, N.Y., says that Ronnybrook uses half as much salt as most commercial butters. The creme fraiche is thick and mildly tangy.

At Your Service    Two groups are offering classes this month in restaurant service. The Art of Restaurant Service, based in Manhattan, has a four-week seminar starting Tuesday, from 3 to 6 P.M., at the Four Seasons Hotel, 57 East 57th Street. Classes cover many aspects of the restaurant business, including negotiating a lease. The price for the course is $450. For information, (212) 645-8303.   The Professional Wine and Service School run by Sterling Vineyards and sponsored by American Express will hold a one-day seminar in New York on March 29 at the Righa Royal Hotel, 151 West 54th Street, from 9 A.M. to 5:30 P.M. The cost is $150 a student, $250 for two. For information, (800) 955-5003. Ethiopian Heat    Afri-Q is a distinctive newcomer among the millions of spicy sauces flooding the grocery shelves. This ruddy, Ethiopian-style sauce, whose heat is tempered by ingredients at once tart and subtly sweet, has a thick, slightly coarse texture and rich aroma. Rachel Yohannes, who grew up in Ethiopia, spent months trying to reproduce the flavors she loved.   Berbere, a seasoning that combines a dozen ingredients, including red chilies, rue seeds, bishops weed (ajwan) and black cumin (nigella), is the critical ingredient, but Ms. Yohannes adds chives, lemon juice and maple syrup, as well as tarragon from her garden in Putnam County, New York.   Afri-Q is delicious brushed on grilled chicken, hamburgers or seafood. It gives a wake-up call to tofu.   Afri-Q, $4.20 to $5.50 for 9 ounces, is sold at Positively 104th Street, 2725 Broadway (at 104th Street) and Whole Foods, 2421 Broadway (89th Street) in Manhattan.    It is available at Karen's Kitchen, 55 Main Street, Cold Spring, N.Y.; at Sprouts Towne, Route 22, Brewster, N.Y., and by mail from Adriana's Caravan in Brooklyn, (800) 316-0820, and Country Cottage Savories, Jefferson Valley, N.Y., (914) 228-1584. Off the Menu Chef Celebration    A gaggle of top French chefs flew into town last weekend to put the icing on a yearlong celebration of Le Cirque's 20th anniversary. On Sunday night, 110 people paid $1,000 each to join in and dine on Paul Bocuse's truffle soup, Roger Verge's scallops with mango, Gerard Boyer's lobster with fennel and Alain Ducasse's spit-roasted woodcook.   The guests, among them the talk-show host Rush Limbaugh, the San Francisco chef Jeremiah Tower and Philippe de Montebello, director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, did not get to eat the roasted ortolans, though. These tiny, greasy, crunchy, gamey-tasting songbirds, considered a delicacy, were served only at a preview lunch for the press on Saturday.    But the Sunday crowd drank far better wines, mostly magnums of 1982 Corton Charlemagne and Chateau Haut-Brion, because Sirio Maccioni, the owner of Le Cirque, saw to it that his co-host was Marvin Shanken, publisher of The Wine Spectator.  Leaning Toward Manhattan    Torre di Pisa, a restaurant that opened in Milan in 1959 and is a magnet for figures in fashion and the press, is opening in New York at 19-21 West 44th Street.    Paolo Meacci, the principal owner, will bring a chef from Italy to prepare many Tuscan specialties, like the tagliata steak, beef with mustard sauce and pastas for which Torre di Pisa is known. David Rockwell will design the restaurant, which is scheduled to open in the fall.  Turkish but Not Turkish    Orhan Yegen, the owner of Deniz (pronounced den-EEZ), which opened last week at 400 East 57th Street, said the name means \\"ocean sea\\" in Turkish. But Mr. Yegen, who is the former owner of Turkish Kitchen in Murray Hill, said his new restaurant is not Turkish nor is it strictly seafood.    \\"It is food of the Mediterranean,\\" he said. \\"And because I am Turkish, from Istanbul, you could say there is 15 percent of my heritage in anything I make.\\"   The restaurant is understated, suffused in gold-beige, and will seat 250 when a cafe area is opened in the front. The main courses, $14.50 to $19.50, include simple grilled salmon, trout stuffed with creamy spinach in a dill and lemon sauce and succulent roast baby lamb with cracked wheat pilaf.

Next, check guidebooks, of which there are five basic types. The first, not strictly a guidebook, delves into the history, lore, character and drama of a place or region or type of travel; it gives you a feel of what a place is like and an indication of whether you will like it.

For this fine and sincere documentary of a modern conflict in a remote Mexican town is as innocent of ulterior motive or moral offense as the Song of Ruth, and a sustention of the censors' prudish orders would have desecrated a work of pictorial art. The Regents, at least, have given assurance that they comprehend integrity in films.And integrity is the distinctive quality that lends authority to this handsome picture, which opened at the Belmont yesterday—integrity in the simple but eloquent writing of John Steinbeck, in the sensitive direction of Herbert Kline and in the eloquent photography of Alexander Hackensmid. These men were primarily interested in telling a simple, human story honestly","excerpt":"they wished to capture on film a moving record of a vital phase of life. And this—with the assent of the Regents—they have managed most effectively to do.\\"The Forgotten Village,\\" which was filmed in a Mexican hamlet with native people as its only actors, is nothing more than a dramatization of a conflict which is common to many lands—the conflict of primitive superstition and witchcraft with modern scientific advance. The modest, Arcadian lives of a group of isolated farmers is disturbed by a typhoid epidemic which mainly infects the children. According to time-honored custom, the Wise Woman is called upon to combat this mysterious affliction with her herbs and magical cures. But the oldest son of one family has acquired some knowledge of the world, and he tries to persuade the people to accept medical aid from outside. And it is in the reactions of the villagers to this earnest attempt to help them that the heart of the drama resides.But the beauty and effectiveness of the picture is, in the main, achieved through the slow and steady accumulation of glimpses into the natives' lives. The human cycle of birth, daily toil and the inexorable mystery of death is traversed with natural dignity. In fact, it was the sequence representing the anguish of a mother in childbirth—told with the camera concentrated upon her tortured face—to which the censors took exception. And the ultimate achievement of this method is a full comprehension of the meager joys and the deeper pathos in the lives of these simple folk.Too much cannot be said for the remarkable performances which Mr. Kline has drawn from his native actors—especially from the older boy, Juan Diego, and from the little fellow who dies of fever, Paco. Nor should one fail to remark the contribution of Mr. Hackensmid's camera. Finer photography is hard to imagine. Hanns Eisler has also prepared a sharply integrated musical score, and Burgess Meredith narrates with proper restraint the affecting prose of Mr. Steinbeck.\\"The Forgotten Village\\" is undeniably a picture which demands a sympathetic attitude from its audience. But for persons who will meet it on its own ground, it should furnish much abiding delight.

The Heusels didn't want to spend last Saturday in Washington, where they were on vacation. It was April Fool's Day, and they wanted to dosomething foolish. They impulsively spent $102 for a pair of round-trip Amtrak tickets for their first trip to the Boardwalk -- which was also their first train ride.   They boarded the 9 A.M. at Union Station. They arrived in Atlantic City at 12:25 P.M. and took a bus to a casino, the Sands, where they were given $10 in coins. Not only did they win back the cost of the trip when they got lucky on the slot machines","excerpt":"they witnessed the end of an era.    Along with 101 other passengers that night, the Heusels were on the last Amtrak run out of Atlantic City. After the 10:15 rumbled out of the rail terminal, Amtrak closed its ticket office and removed just about everything but the tracks, hoping to shave $4.6 million from its budget.    The end of Amtrak's six-year run did not mean the end of rail transportation to Atlantic City, which is still provided by New Jersey Transit. But for people like the Heusels, going to Atlantic City by train would no longer be an effortless caprice.    They would have to want to go badly enough to travel first to Philadelphia's 30th Street Station and leave the comparatively luxurious Amtrak coaches, with their burgundy reclining seats, convivial cafe cars and easy-to-find restrooms, for a New Jersey Transit train that makes a half-dozen stops each way; has no reclining seats, running water or food car, and doesn't get you free coins from casinos. (The New Jersey Transit fare is lower: $6 each way on the Philadelphia-Atlantic City run, compared with $9 on Amtrak.)    \\"It's really too bad,\\" Mr. Heusel said, getting coffee in the cafe car. \\"I could really get to like this.\\"    On the platform, Richard Del Bono, the engineer on the 10:15, solemnly embraced saddened Amtrak employees. \\"This is an emotional moment,\\" he said. \\"I ran the first train down here in 1989, and now I'm riding the last one out.\\"    Though Amtrak's era in Atlantic City is hardly long enough to be called an era, the railroad era is something else. The city's initial prosperity was based on the ease with which day-trippers from Philadelphia and New York could board a train and, within a few hours, inhale the salt breeze.    A railroad conductor, Alexander Boardman, invented the city's Boardwalk. In the 1930's, the city had two train terminals, one at South Carolina Avenue, the other at what has become the bus terminal, at Missouri and Arctic Avenues.    The railroads left Atlantic City in 1982, victims of the automobile and the casino bus. But when bus-exhaust pollution levels began to rival those at the Lincoln Tunnel, the county improvement authority spent $20 million for a new terminal to adjoin a new convention center (now under construction and scheduled to open in 1996). Amtrak paid for repairs and track improvements; the state built or restored stations along the line.   Amtrak and the casino industry had high hopes for the train. Amtrak added a first-class club car and encouraged chartered junkets for high rollers. Some casinos offered coin refunds to passengers. And New Jersey Transit began commuter service for casino employees.    But Amtrak never quite got enough warm bodies. For last few years, its trains were rarely more than half full.    \\"It meant a lot to some people,\\" said the conductor on the 10:15, Earl Davisson, who, instead of punching tickets, was autographing them. \\"We had our regulars we'd see every week. There was a group up in Connecticut that would charter a whole car once or twice a year. We had birthday parties all the time.    \\"Now I hear we might be back when they get the convention center open. But then again we might not. Nobody thought we'd be back when they stopped in '82, but here we are. Or were.\\"    He signed a ticket. \\"Nothing's forever.\\" Last (Amtrak) Train Out of Town"},{"year":"1940","title":"1940 revd ALLEN, LINDMEIER VICTORS","excerpt":"They Won 1940 Championships in Horseshoe Pitching"},{"year":"2005","title":"THE Yankees gained a reprieve from their playoff elimination by winning two of three games from the Red Sox, but the Mets?

The United States spends far more on health care than any other country. Medicare and Medicaid eat up a growing share of the Federal budget. But 35 million Americans have no health insurance.  THE PROPOSALS     President Bush would grant tax credits to poor people and tax deductions to middle-income people to help them buy private health insurance. He would allow self-employed people to deduct 100 percent of the cost of their health insurance premiums (up from the current 25 percent). He would encourage small businesses to pool their purchasing power to buy health insurance at a discount.    Under Governor Clinton's plan, a new entity, composed of consumers and providers of health care, would establish national limits on health-care spending, with a separate budget for each state. Employers would have to buy private health insurance for their employees. The Government would guarantee insurance coverage for people who are not working","excerpt":"they would pay premiums that rise with their income. The Government would provide tax credits to small employers to help offset the cost of health insurance in the early years of a transition period. Small businesses could band together, form large groups and buy insurance at a discount. ARTFUL DODGES    Mr. Bush does not say how he would control health costs. Many experts doubt that his plan would slow the rise in medical prices. Health insurance premiums could rise faster than the tax credits and deductions allowed for the purchase of such insurance. Insurers would have to offer coverage to all applicants, regardless of their medical problems. This virtually guarantees an increase in premiums for healthy people, but the Bush plan says nothing about that.   Governor Clinton does not say exactly how he would finance coverage for people who are not employed. He says, \\"We will dedicate Federal savings from cost controls to expanding coverage to all.\\" But hardly anyone believes that such savings would finance expanded coverage for all who need it. Mr. Clinton is also vague about the future of Medicaid, the Federal-state program for 30 million low-income people. He says it will be folded into a new program of \\"private coverage\\" through publicly sponsored purchasing groups. SCORECARD    The Bush Administration has put together a coherent proposal, but Mr. Bush suffers from a public perception that he ignored this issue for nearly three years.    Mr. Clinton has not confronted the true cost of his program; he asserts that his proposal \\"does not require new taxes.\\" But he benefits from a public perception that Democrats are more concerned and knowledgeable about health care.

The film was \\"Julius Caesar,\\" an Italian production brought into this country some eight or nine years ago by George Kleine, it is said, and now being offered by him for general distribution for the first time in a revised and re-edited form.The picture is historical in two senses. Not only does it deal with ancient Rome, but, being itself of relatively ancient manufacture, as time is measured in the motion picture industry, it exemplifies the cinematography of the past in comparison with that of the present. Thus the photoplay, with its elaborate and apparently authentic settings, its historical properties, costumes and incidents, gives the spectator a more or less definite impression of pre-Christian Rome and its people, while at the same time, with its harsh, ungraded lighting, its episodic rather than continuous story and its dependence upon mass as opposed to individual action, it shows itself to be an early as well as a foreign production. Accordingly one finds himself sometimes interested in Caesar, his associates and his city, and sometimes in the evidences of the age of the film.But, of course, spectators in general will be interested in the picture to the extent that it vivifies its people and places for them, and while it cannot be said that the film possesses the vitality of the more recent screen works which have had the benefit of the same intelligence and sincerity in their production. It is, nevertheless, a genuinely interesting composition. The unrelieved lighting of some of its scenes is disturbing, the excessive formality of the gestures and manners of its players makes it sometimes seem more like a pageant than a reproduction of the real life of real people, and its lack of continuity disappoints any expectations of dramatic development you may have. But the picture does give you an illuminating glimpse of ancient Rome and its people, it shows you the Senate in what may be accepted as an authentic session, it gives you some idea of how the Gauls looked and fought in their war against the Roman legions, and it presents the internal strife in which Sulla, Caesar, Pompey and the others were involved as simply a fight among politicians for power and place: It has a real interest, therefore, especially for the person equipped with a general reading knowledge of Rome and the Romans of the last century B. C.Cheers for Caesar.THAT the picture has a vital quality even for the not over-educated youth of America was strongly, not to say startlingly, evidenced at last Tuesday afternoon's showing at the Standard Theatre. When the present writer was there, the house was half full of school children, mostly boys of from 10 to 15 years of age. It was apparent that the story had a certain strangeness for them and their attitude was not at all reverential. They were not awed by the fact that they were sitting before a serious historical work. They laughed at the solemnly bowing, oddly costumed Ethiopian (or were they Numidian?) slaves, who, obviously, were just dressed up negroes to them","excerpt":"they yelled their delight when Caesar's legions waded into the Rubicon and got their skirts wet, and when the Roman conspirators drew lots by the method of throwing dice, they howled at what looked like a crap game among dignified Roman Senators. Thus the picture had elements of comedy for them scarcely intended by its producers.But it also appealed strongly to them as a story of struggle and adventure. Although the film did not make a god-like superman of Caesar, even going almost far enough in the opposite direction to satisfy H. G. Wells, the boys took no time at all in making up their minds that Caesar was a satisfactory hero for them, and throughout the showing of the photoplay they were his ardent partisans. They cheered his victories and his triumphal entry into Rome, they booed the Gauls and hissed Pompey off the screen. The historical spectacle, \\"Julius Caesar,\\" was a recognizable, if somewhat strange, melodrama in their eyes, and they accorded Anthony Novelli, in the rôle of Caesar, the same honor they customarily give to Tom Mix, Harry Carey and William S. Hart. He was their man of the hour.All of which may provoke reflections by the thoughtful. Of course, the study of Shakespeare's play and Roman history had introduced Caesar to some, if not all, of the boys, but it is doubtful whether he ever evoked half the enthusiasm as a textbook figure that he enjoyed in his screen embodiment. Does this, then, mean anything to the advocates, or the opponents, of visual education? And should the alacrity with which Young America gave its heart to a purely military and political hero be taken as an indictment of an educational method which still makes heroes of the favorites of Mars, or as a manifestation of the congenital bellicosity of man against which the Conference for the Limitation of Armament can be of no avail?An Imaginative Production.A CORRESPONDENT writes to say that THE TIMES reviewer bestowed unmerited praise on \\"One Glorious Day\\" when he said that it was \\"imaginative,\\" because, according to the correspondent, the photoplay \\"is plainly taken, the idea, from one of Frank Stockton's stories, 'The Transferred Ghost.'\\" But isn't this an immaterial charge? What the present writer meant when he said that \\"One Glorious Day\\" was imaginative was that its treatment showed imagination. He did not say that the idea of the story was original, and it is not likely that even the authors of the photoplay would claim originality for their story. Ever since the days of demons in the Old Testament, and especially since the advent of modern psychical research, the idea of an allen spirit's possessing the body of another has been in such general circulation that it may now be regarded as common property. Nor does the fact that in \\"One Glorious Day\\" there is a timid lover who becomes bold when his body is inhabited by an adventurous spirit put the picture in debt to any one story or play. The spiritual metamorphosis of timid lovers by one means or another has frequently been witnessed in fiction, if not in fact.So it was not to testify to any originality of idea or plot that \\"One Glorious Day\\" was characterized as imaginative, but to give credit for the use of imagination to James Cruze, who directed the production, to Karl Brown, who photographed it, and to Walter Woods, who prepared its scenario. The picture was imaginatively done—and this is the most important thing about any production. It's the way a story is told that counts, and \\"One Glorious Day\\" is told in about the brightest and most eloquent motion pictures that have come out of Hollywood.But if its authors did lift their idea from any particular story, surely that story was not \\"The Transferred Ghost,\\" for Frank R. Stockton's skit and the photoplay have very little in common. Each has a timid lover, it is true, and each has an unembodied spirit, but the ghost of the Stockton story never possesses the body of the lover and the lover does not become emboldened. He proposes to the girl quite unintentionally, and the ghost to whom he addresses the words which sound like a proposal and which the girl thinks are intended for her is an altogether arbitrary conception, in no way related to the real spiritistic hypothesis which, however irreverently it may be applied, accounts for the adventures of Ek in his one glorious day.

Victor Sheymov of the K.G.B., his wife, Olga, and their 5-year-old daughter, Elena, were spirited from the Soviet Union by the Central Intelligence Agency. It was rare enough for any K.G.B. officer to defect, and rarer still for one to slip out of Moscow, where the Soviet spy agency's counterintelligence efforts were legendary. But for an officer at Sheymov's level to defect -- with his wife and child, no less -- was unprecedented. Moreover, Sheymov avoided leaving any evidence of unusual preparations, leading the K.G.B. to conclude that he and his family were murdered on a routine trip out of town. As a result, the Soviet spy agency was unaware of his presence in the United States for as long as 10 years -- a devastating coup.\\n\\nStill little known, Sheymov may have been the most important C.I.A. catch of the cold war. At the time of his defection he was the chief trouble-shooter in the K.G.B.'s cipher communications, the expert called in to patch suspected security breaches and design leakproof communications systems. He was one of only a handful of officials who knew the entire structure of the highly compartmentalized agency. As such, he clearly had the background to provide the Americans with enough intelligence information to systematically penetrate the K.G.B.\\n\\nLike many in his generation, Sheymov had gradually grown disillusioned with the stupidity, illogic and immorality of the Soviet system. The K.G.B. was the nerve center of that system, and he had already, at age 33, been tapped for leadership within it. He decided that defection was the only way out, and that he would defect to the C.I.A. to inflict the greatest possible damage on the K.G.B.\\n\\nVictor and Olga Sheymov became United States citizens and now live in the Washington area. He is a business consultant, and also works on contract for the Federal Government. She is a professional artist. \\n\\nIn the following adaptation from his third-person account, \\"Tower of Secrets,\\" Sheymov recounts how he was able to pull off the extraordinary escape, beginning with the surprisingly difficult task of contacting the C.I.A.\\nIT WAS IN THE FALL OF 1979 THAT VICTOR Sheymov decided they had to defect to the C.I.A. He had failed to contact the Americans four times. Even though he was a born Muscovite and knew the city like the inside of his pocket, and even though he was confident he knew the counterintelligence environment well, each operation had to be extemely risky.\\n\\nHis access to state secrets required that he be kept under frequent surveillance. His apartment and his car were bugged. And by trying to contact the C.I.A., he was operating against an almost endless chain of systems designed to prevent exactly what he was trying to do. It was only a matter of time before counterintelligence pieced together a pattern. He also knew that his savvy bosses were bound to notice the subtle changes in his attitude. The clock was running.\\n\\n\\"Olga, I think I've got an idea,\\" Victor said one night in a Moscow park. (Their apartment, they well knew, was bugged.) \\"It was probably not simply four failures in a row. It was more likely one conceptual failure. This problem is crazy enough to demand a crazy solution. So, what's the craziest thing I could do, bar going to the American Embassy here, which means going straight to the K.G.B.?\\"\\n\\n\\"Trying to do it abroad?\\"\\n\\n\\"Yes. Can you think of anything crazier?\\"\\n\\n\\"No, not really. You're guarded every moment you're out of the embassy, and Elena and I are hostages -- we can't leave the country,\\" Olga said softly. Then Victor saw a question in her eyes, the question she would never ask out loud, even to herself: \\"What happens to Elena and me if you go into an American Embassy somewhere, get noticed and can't get out?\\"\\n\\nVictor knew this was a possibility. He knew also that the subject couldn't be discussed. There was no sense in assurances","excerpt":"they'd sound false.\\n\\nSo Victor went ahead with his plan, maneuvering his boss into sending him to Warsaw to follow up on a previous mission. Once there, he allowed himself to be persuaded by the local K.G.B. chief to assess the local C.I.A. intercept capability.\\n\\nHe was accompanied, as always, by the chief security officer. \\"Americans work mostly from the embassy, so I should take a closer look at their compound, somehow,\\" he told the guard, Valery. \\"I want to see their antennas and all that kind of stuff.\\"\\n\\nOn the second circle of the building Victor said: \\"Pull over close by.\\"\\n\\nValery stopped the car. They looked at the building. One glance was enough for Victor to dislike it. The entire ground floor had glass sides. One could see an American flag and a uniformed marine standing guard. A receptionist's counter was visible at the left side of the lobby.\\n\\n\\"What observation points are available from this side?\\" Victor asked.\\n\\n\\"See that thing high on the lamppost? That's a Polish surveillance camera, not a traffic camera. Switches from normal to infrared, so it covers around the clock. There's an observation post on the second floor of the building across the street, manned around the clock.\\"\\n\\nVictor calculated that it gave the watchers a good view of the center of the lobby.\\n\\n\\"Do the Poles have another one on the other side?\\"\\n\\n\\"No. Do you want to go inside and take a look? They have pretty good optics there.\\"\\n\\n\\"No, thanks.\\"\\n\\nVictor didn't need to ask if there was a surveillance unit attached to the observation post. That was standard operating procedure.\\n\\nVICTOR WENT TO THE OFFICE OF THE Warsaw K.G.B. chief at about 10:30 in the morning.\\n\\n\\"Is Valery around?\\" he asked a secretary. \\"I'm really in the doghouse.\\"\\n\\n\\"No, he left half an hour ago for a meeting. What's wrong?\\"\\n\\n\\"Oh, I took this book out of the library on Monday. I swore up and down I'd bring it back yesterday but I forgot. Are any of the drivers available for about 15 minutes?\\"\\n\\nThe ride was very short. Out of the embassy compound, one block up Belwederska, one block to the left and one block up 1 Armii WP. The driver stopped at the entrance to the cultural center.\\n\\nVictor noticed that from his seat the driver had a clear view inside the building, and could easily see the door of the men's room. \\"Why don't you park over there,\\" he said, pointing to a spot beyond the door. \\"I'll be about 10 minutes.\\" He entered the building, which was nearly empty at that hour, went to the library, returned the book and chatted awhile with the librarian. He wanted to create the impression of having spent more time with her than he actually did, in case she was questioned later by counterintelligence agents. Then he ambled back into the lobby.\\n\\nThere, Victor quickly turned and strode into the men's room, putting on driving gloves as he went. Taking out his tools, he walked briskly down the aisle, checking the empty stalls as he went to the window at the end. First, he unlatched and pulled open the center pair of inside windows. Then he went to work on the two nails that security personnel had hammered into the outside windows to prevent them from opening outward.\\n\\nUsing the blades of two chisels, he carefully eased out the head of the first nail from the frame of one outer window. If only one chisel were used, the nail would bend and make a small, but irreparable mark on the wood next to it. The nail squeaked and started to move. One-eighth of an inch was enough. With pliers he steadily pulled the nail straight out. He was very careful -- old rusty nails have a nasty habit of breaking.\\n\\nHaving pulled out the second nail and put it away, he peeked through a scratch in the white paint that covered the outside windows. There was nobody outside near the window. He carefully unlocked the latches and, holding the sharp ends of two replacement nails in his right hand, he softly pushed the left half of the window slightly open. The replacements were rusty nails similar to the originals, but broken into two pieces. He then inserted one of the half-nails into the hole of the old one in the sill and pushed it down with the flat side of a chisel. He quickly repeated the operation with the right frame and closed the window.\\n\\nVictor stood still, his ear turned to the door of the bathroom. The driver could be a problem. Silence. Lastly, he pushed the top halves of the nails into the frames with a chisel, using a soft cloth to avoid leaving any shiny marks on the heads. He then closed and latched the inner windows. The tools went back into his pockets. Victor looked at his watch. Just under five minutes. Not bad for working carefully. He took off the gloves and returned to the car. The driver was reading a book.\\n\\nAS THEY WERE ABOUT TO enter the theater at 5:30, Victor dropped his lighter. As he got down to look for it he said, \\"Go on, I'll catch up with you inside.\\" After finding the lighter, Victor stood and held up his grimy hands in dismay. He shook his head, looked around and, catching Valery's eye, turned purposefully toward the men's room. He moved to a basin, turned on the water and slowly scrubbed his hands. The last men in the bathroom went past him out into the lobby. Victor wiped his hands on the roller towel, quickly moved down to the last stall on the left near the window and locked the door. It was 5:32. The movie would end at 7:15.\\n\\nAll quiet. After a couple of minutes, Victor unlocked the door, came out and put on his trench coat and gloves. He opened the inside windows and secured the latches so that they wouldn't lock when the window was closed. He attached a thin thread to both latches. Then he unlocked the outer window. He opened the window slightly, just enough to see round to the street corner. There might be Polish surveillance, or a passerby. 5:35.\\n\\nAs a large truck lumbered past, Victor swung the window open. In a second he was on the ground outside. He quickly pulled the inner windows as near to closed as he could, then pulled the threads. The windows shut tight. He pushed the outer window closed. By now the truck had almost passed him. Victor sprinted to the left. He came to the intersection with Marszalkowska, the most crowded street in Warsaw. He quickly crossed and walked briskly through smaller streets. He didn't see any surveillance. Victor put on his beret.\\n\\nHe spotted a taxi near a corner. He walked around the small block, slowly approaching the taxi from behind. He glanced back -- very unprofessional. He got into the taxi, simultaneously putting on an old pair of his father's glasses. Now, his disguise was complete.\\n\\n\\"American Embassy.\\"\\n\\nAt the embassy, Victor paid the driver and looked at his watch. 5:56. Victor opened the front door. There was a receptionist at the counter near the left wall of the lobby. She was probably Polish, so he would have to speak softly. He went to the young marine standing guard and said, \\"I need to speak to the duty diplomat.\\"\\n\\nThe marine nodded, picked up a phone and said something quickly into the mouthpiece. Then he turned back to Victor: \\"Wait, please,\\" and indicated the row of chairs along the glass front wall.\\n\\nThat was not in Victor's plans. As he walked to the chairs, he would have to face the window. And the watchers. All of a sudden, in the gathering darkness, the bright lights in the lobby went on. There were no curtains. He was in an illuminated fishbowl. Still with his glasses and beret on, Victor started moving crabwise, while constantly looking at something very interesting on the blank interior wall. He knew he had to keep his head turned away from the surveillance camera.\\n\\nFive minutes passed. Nothing was happening. This was something Victor was totally unprepared for. Finally, at 12 minutes after 6, a man came out of the elevator near the reception desk and walked up to Victor.\\n\\n\\"How can I help you?\\" he asked in Polish.\\n\\n\\"Can we talk somewhere else?\\" Victor spoke in Ukrainian, close enough to Polish.\\n\\n\\"Sure.\\"\\n\\nHe led Victor past the receptionist and through a door to a room beyond.\\n\\n\\"I would like to ask for political asylum.\\"\\n\\n\\"Where do you work?\\"\\n\\nVictor took a piece of paper from his pocket and scribbled: K.G.B.\\n\\nInstantly, the man's manner changed. He led Victor upstairs into some kind of storage room. That's really smart, Victor thought. Who would bug a storage room? A second man soon appeared.\\n\\n\\"Do you have any time limitation now?\\"\\n\\n\\"Yes, I have to be back at no later than 7:10.\\"\\n\\n\\"Can we meet at a later date?\\"\\n\\n\\"No, I'm leaving for Moscow on Friday.\\"\\n\\n\\"O.K. Sorry, but we have to observe the formalities. Who is the Resident at the K.G.B. station here?\\"\\n\\n\\"Solovyev.\\"\\n\\n\\"Who's running line X?\\"\\n\\nVictor answered a few questions of that nature, which he knew were necessary to establish his bona fides. Then Victor offered the men his passport. \\"Make sure you get good pictures of it. There are some special signals in it, we'll discuss that later.\\" The first man disappeared with the passport and soon returned.\\n\\n\\"O.K. we're satisfied. What's your line of work?\\"\\n\\n\\"Cipher communications.\\" \\n\\n\\"Are you a cipher clerk?\\"\\n\\n\\"No, I'm responsible for the security of the K.G.B. cipher communications abroad.\\"\\n\\nBoth men looked at each other. They could hardly contain their excitement. They knew then they had a big one. \\"What can we do for you?\\"\\n\\n\\"My wife and 5-year-old daughter cannot travel abroad. Security restriction.\\" The man nodded. \\"I need you to help us get out; to guarantee us political asylum in the U.S., citizenship and a comfortable living.\\"\\n\\n\\"Given who you are, I think it can be arranged. Are you sure you want to go back now? You know the level of risk. Why don't we just get you to the U.S. right now?\\"\\n\\n\\"Out of the question.\\"\\n\\n\\"O.K., it's your neck. Anything else?\\"\\n\\n\\"No, just meet me in Moscow.\\" Victor took another piece of paper and wrote out the conditions of the meeting. He passed it to the man asking the questions.\\n\\n\\"Personal meeting?\\"\\n\\n\\"Yes.\\" Victor looked the man straight in the eye. \\"I know you think I'm crazy,\\" he said to himself. \\"But, it's my neck.\\"\\n\\n\\"O.K.\\" He looked at his watch. \\"I guess you have to get out. Here's your passport. Thanks.\\"\\n\\n\\"Yes. How?\\"\\n\\n\\"We'll give you a ride.\\" Victor gave him the address.\\n\\nAs they went back downstairs, the man asked: \\"By the way, have you ever heard of Halloween?\\"\\n\\n\\"No, what's that?\\"\\n\\n\\"It's an American holiday. Today is Halloween. You've pulled one hell of a trick or treat.\\"\\n\\n\\"I'm sorry?\\"\\n\\n\\"Oh, never mind, you'll find out.\\" Another man drove Victor away from the embassy, and dropped him off not far from the cultural center.\\n\\nIt was now 7:05. The movie would end in 10 minutes. Victor walked briskly to the side street. 7:10. Outside the window, he had to wait another minute for the street to clear. He then opened the window noisily, to startle anyone inside and give himself a chance to escape. Seeing that nobody was there, he hoisted himself onto the sill and jumped down.\\n\\nAfter washing his hands and face, he went to the door. There he bumped into Valery.\\n\\n\\"Hey, man, you look awful.\\"\\n\\n\\"I told you, you better check out what they put into the food in the dining room. It's just about done me in.\\"\\n\\nBACK IN MOSCOW, Victor wasn't sure what to do about countersurveillance on the way to his first meeting with his C.I.A. contact. Ideally, he should take a long route through different parts of the city. But in Victor's situation this was particularly dangerous because his face was familiar to many surveillance officers. And he didn't have the backup to check on surveillance. It would have to be a short route.\\n\\nThe advantage of the short route was that he would know exactly how much time he'd need. There'd be very little chance of a slip-up with transportation. Five minutes to catch the bus, 8 minutes to Belyaevo, 2 minutes to get a taxi, 15 minutes to double-back, 30-minute metro ride, 3 minutes to double-back, 2 minutes to the statue. Sixty-five minutes plus 5 to spare.\\n\\nJust before 10 P.M., he gave his wife her cue.\\n\\n\\"Victor, would you please take out the garbage?\\" Olga spoke distinctly, for the benefit of the \\"house ears.\\" The garbage-disposal chute was in the stairway, one flight down.\\n\\n\\"Sure.\\" All the appropriate sound effects followed, including the grumbles of an irritable spouse performing an unpleasant chore.\\n\\n\\"Hell. I've got a splitting headache.\\" Front door opens, Victor put the garbage in the chute, returns. The door is still open. \\"Olga, I think I'd better go straight to bed.\\"\\n\\n\\"Of course, darling. Try to get to sleep as soon as you can.\\"\\n\\nA grunt of agreement. The sound of the door closing. Olga inside, Victor outside. He rushed soundlessly down the stairs.\\n AROUND 11, VICTOR CAME to a statue 90 feet from the metro station rotunda, where he was supposed to meet his contact. He paused for 10 or 15 seconds, and glanced around. Nothing unusual. The phone booth on the corner was empty, a good sign -- if surveillance people were around, they couldn't resist the temptation to use it. He slowly moved toward the alley off Chistoprudny Boulevard.\\n\\nOut of the corner of his eye he saw a male figure in dark overcoat and fur hat approaching from behind.\\n\\n\\"Victor Ivanovich?\\" A voice with an accent.\\n\\n\\"Yes.\\"\\n\\n\\"Good evening. I'm Misha.\\" He extended his hand.\\n\\n\\"Good evening, Misha. Nice to meet you.\\"\\n\\nThey started walking slowly along the boulevard. After a pause, Misha broke the silence.\\n\\n\\"How much time do you have tonight?\\"\\n\\n\\"No restrictions. How about you?\\"\\n\\n\\"Same here.\\"\\n\\nVictor nodded curtly. \\"Before we start, let me ask you a question.\\"\\n\\n\\"Please.\\"\\n\\n\\"Where did I approach your service?\\"\\n\\nMisha smiled. \\"Warsaw. Do I look O.K. now?\\"\\n\\n\\"Certainly much better.\\"\\n\\n\\"We're very impressed with your offer, and satisfying your request in all its aspects is not out of the realm of possibility. However, as a professional you must also realize that what you are requesting is a very serious and difficult undertaking.\\"\\n\\n\\"If it weren't, I wouldn't be asking you,\\" Victor said with a smile.\\n\\n\\"Of course. So, we have to have a better understanding of your field and level of expertise before we make a final decision.\\"\\n\\nThe questions continued for a while. Finally Misha said, \\"I guess that's enough. Obviously, I'm not qualified to evaluate your answers. They'll be analyzed by our experts. But I'm sure every thing'll be fine.\\"\\n\\n\\"I also would like to ask you a few questions.\\"\\n\\n\\"Please.\\"\\n\\n\\"How many of your people know of my existence?\\"\\n\\nA pause. \\"Eight in our agency, perhaps five or six outside. Six know your identity, two of them from the little visit you paid in Warsaw. That's about as few as we can get away with. This case has been assigned the highest priority.\\"\\n\\n\\"I'd be reluctant to provide you with any information you'd be tempted to act on immediately. Intelligence information has a nasty habit of finding its way back.\\"\\n\\n\\"We've already assumed that. Let me assure you that we wouldn't use any information coming from you while you're still here, even if you were to provide it.\\"\\n\\n\\"Good.\\"\\n\\n\\"Well then, how shall we communicate in the future?\\"\\n\\n\\"Simple. Personal meetings.\\"\\n\\n\\"What? You know that any personal meeting in Moscow is extremely dangerous and should be avoided at all cost. We have numerous very secure means of communications. As a matter of fact, I've brought some with me today.\\"\\n\\n\\"I'm fully aware of the dangers. However, not long ago I attended a counterintelligence briefing. They read out a very long list of K.G.B. counterintelligence successes. The litany of causes was quite telling: 'Caught on a dead drop, caught on a letter drop, caught on a brush contact, caught operating radio,' and so on. And you know what? Out of all of them -- dozens -- there was no mention of anyone being caught in a personal meeting.\\"\\n\\nVictor paused. \\"Oh, another thing. All communications about me between the Moscow Station and Washington must be done by pouch. No telegrams.\\"\\n\\nMisha looked at Victor very carefully. He spoke slowly, \\"You realize, don't you, that if that's the case, this whole operation will take much longer?\\"\\n\\n\\"I'd rather be safe than sorry.\\"\\n\\nMisha laughed. \\"You know, you're a very interesting mix of extreme caution and outright recklessness.\\" He paused. \\"All right, it's your neck after all. We'll do everything in our power to help you and to assure your security. You're the one who's in the cold, and we'll play along.\\"\\n\\n\\"Thank you. I don't want you to feel offended, but because of my peculiar situation I'd really prefer to do it the way I feel comfortable.\\"\\n\\nMisha nodded. \\"With what we're looking at, I guess a month is a good bet for the next meeting.\\"\\n\\n\\"I agree. Let's say the same place and the same time four weeks from today?\\"\\n\\n\\"All right. I agree -- reluctantly. If we don't connect, then every two weeks. Same conditions. If I can't make it, Pasha will.\\" The man took an envelope out of his pocket and handed it to Victor. \\"This is a letter for you from Washington. The paper is water-soluble, so be careful. There are some additional questions there, as well as a few other ways you can find us if you need to -- emergency signals, meeting conditions, you'll see. Disregard the part about communications.\\"\\n\\n\\"Thanks.\\"\\n\\nMisha turned to Victor and suddenly smiled broadly. \\"I'm really happy to have met you. Good luck and be careful, O.K.?\\"\\n\\n\\"Same back. Good night.\\"\\n\\nAFTER TWO MORE meetings, the defection date was set. But Victor had to report to Olga that according to the Americans, playing dead was a stupid idea.\\n\\n\\"From a conventional point of view, I suppose I have to agree. Nevertheless, I'm still determined to try tricking the K.G.B. into believing that we're dead. The fact is, there's zero risk, and it doesn't involve much effort. If we succeed, we'll have a tremendous advantage -- not to mention that it would make things much easier for those we leave behind.\\"\\n\\n\\"How on earth are we going to convince the K.G.B. we are dead,\\" Olga asked. \\"You wouldn't just leave three bodies behind and hope to fool them.\\"\\n\\n\\"No, the only way to do it is to deny them hard evidence and to mislead them with circumstantial evidence.\\"\\n\\n\\"Is that realistic?\\"\\n\\n\\"I think so. You see, if I disappear a whole lot of people will be in hot water. Most of those people are very senior. They'll be desperate. They'll do anything to save their own hides. So there's plenty of incentive for them to believe I'm dead. We just have to help them along.\\"\\n\\n\\"I haven't a clue how we are going to pull it off.\\"\\n\\n\\"We'll talk about it at length later,\\" Victor said. \\"But, for now, tell me how often you go up into the attic.\\"\\n\\n\\"Oh, twice a year. Why?\\"\\n\\n\\"People store things in an attic that they rarely need, but are likely to fetch if they plan to leave. One of the first things they will check is whether the dust has been disturbed up there in the last month or so. So if you want anything from the attic, get it out now and don't go near the damn place again.\\"\\n\\nTHEY WERE TO LEAVE on a Friday after work. At the end of the day, Victor closed his safe, secured both locks and affixed his seal. He felt the rush of starting-line adrenaline he got when he took on a dangerous assignment. He looked at the clock. 5:55. He was already 10 minutes late. The train out of Moscow was leaving at 8:30. \\n\\nAt 6:45, Victor rang his apartment doorbell. Olga was waiting.\\n\\n\\"Are you ready?\\"\\n\\n\\"Of course.\\"\\n\\nVictor quickly changed his clothes. Five minutes later all three of them were sitting silently together on the living-room couch. It was a custom few Russians would skip before a long trip or an important journey. Theirs would be both. Victor broke the silence.\\n\\n\\"All right, my beautiful ladies, let's go.\\" Victor and Olga both kissed Elena.\\n\\nThe door clicked softly shut behind them.\\n\\nIt was pouring. Victor and Olga were both wearing black raincoats that nicely concealed the fact that they both seemed a bit heavier than usual. Elena was in a very feminine bright yellow coat with a matching beret. Their large gym bags, acquired the day before, were brightly colored, one red and white, the other blue and white. A taxi soon appeared, and as they piled in Victor said, \\"Varshavskaya, please.\\" It was now 7 P.M.\\n\\nVarshavskaya was the perfect place to vanish. An underpass from the street led to both a metro station and a train station. Southbound trains headed for the countryside -- a 50-mile stretch of dachas, many of them far from the railroad, and served by local buses. Northbound trains traveled to one of Moscow's principal railroad stations, and on through to a number of other major stations. In addition, Varshavskaya was where a highway to the south began, so there were always a lot of people being picked up by their friends and relatives in cars just near the entrance to the metro station. The investigators would trace them to Varshavskaya and hit a dead end right there.\\n\\nOn the metro, they worked their way to the rear of the first car. The brightly colored bags went one on top of another into the corner, and the three Sheymovs stood shielding them. 7:30. A 20-minute ride brought them to Ploschad Sverdlova, one of the older metro stations, with marble walls and bronze statues. The station also happened to be a major hub for lines in the center of Moscow. They hung back a bit, and made for a vacant bench tucked into a deep bay. Victor unzipped both gym bags. In 30 seconds, the platform was completely empty. They had two minutes between trains.\\n\\n\\"Now.\\" They took off their coats. Quickly two other bags -- one black, one gray, also bought the day before -- were pulled out. The bright ones were then folded and tucked away, along with their raincoats. Under 30 seconds. Now there was a woman in a nondescript ocher jacket, a man in a red Windbreaker and a little boy in a short green jacket -- three ordinary people who'd apparently just missed the last train and were now patiently waiting on the platform where the first car would stop. \\n\\nAt 8:07, they pulled into Belarusskaya metro station, with the train station above it of the same name. Final metamorphosis. Similar platform, similar bench. They melded into the crowd leaving the next train. Now Olga was dressed in a baggy dull brown sweater that completely concealed her figure. Her hair was down and loose, covering her forehead almost down to her eyes. Victor was in a dull gray pullover and a cap. Anyone seeing Elena's gray cap and gray jacket from a distance would have taken her for a boy.\\n\\nOlga knelt beside Elena: \\"Darling, do you remember the game we're playing?\\"\\n\\n\\"Yes, Mama. We're playing that I'm a boy and my name's Alesha.\\"\\n\\n\\"You're dressed like a boy to see if you can fool everyone on our trip. You lose if anyone guesses you're a girl, see? If you talk about dolls and other things that little girls like, of course they'll know you're a girl. But, if you don't talk too much and you carry yourself like a big tough boy, they'll never guess, and you'll win!\\"\\n\\n\\"But I don't like dolls.\\"\\n\\nThe discussion ended as they boarded the train, with Elena still only half-convinced. They went along the narrow corridor of the car to their compartment in the middle. Victor immediately closed the sliding door.\\n\\nAt 8:35 the train finally moved, only five minutes behind schedule.\\n\\nElena soon fell asleep, and for the first hour Victor and Olga looked out the window in silence, watching as the familiar Moscow scenery dwindled into the rainy dusk. When the accelerating train flew by the tiny station that was the stop for Victor's parents' dacha, they finally looked at each other. As they thought about what they were leaving behind -- friends, family, everything -- Victor could see his own sadness and nostalgia reflected in Olga's dark eyes.\\n\\nShe broke the silence, and pulled them both back into the present: \\"You think we're O.K. so far?\\"\\n\\n\\"Yes, I'm positive. Our little detours would have driven anyone tailing us crazy; they would have shown themselves. I saw nothing.\\"\\n\\n\\"I hope so.\\" Olga looked at Victor pensively. \\"Now we're in God's hands. No matter what happens, Victor, I want you to know that I don't regret anything.\\"\\n\\n\\"I know. Neither do I.\\"\\n\\nAfter a pause, Victor said, \\"Let's review what we've done so far. Did you mention this trip to anybody?\\"\\n\\n\\"Just one neighbor. I told her we were going to the dacha of an old friend of yours. She wasn't curious -- more concerned about the rotten weather.\\"\\n\\n\\"How did you leave things in the house?\\" \\n\\n\\"Strictly as usual. The refrigerator's pretty full. There are a few unwashed dishes in the sink. I even set some laundry to soak in the washing machine. I've left stuff soaking over a weekend before. And I haven't been in the attic for months. It's normal.\\"\\n\\nVictor lay quietly on his berth. It was impossible to fall asleep. In arranging the defection, Victor had worked against the K.G.B.'s departments of intelligence, counterintelligence, surveillance and eavesdropping. Now he was facing a final K.G.B. enemy, the feared Border Guards.\\n\\nThe Soviet border. At least two rows of barbed wire, guard stations every few miles, machine-gun towers, a harrowed strip of land at least 100 yards wide, then another strip, heavily booby-trapped with flare mines, a lot of dogs, heavy round-the-clock patrols on foot with dogs, by car or on horse -- endless echelons of all that stuff, starting more than 20 miles inside and growing denser and denser toward the border. Countless informants in local villages on both sides of the border. Victor felt relieved that none of that would be his concern.\\n SATURDAY MORNING. THEY MADE A final switch to a local train, then gave some sleeping medicine to a protesting Elena. \\n\\n\\"Why? I'm not sick. Besides, I'm a tough boy.\\"\\n\\nShe was soon dozing off. The train arrived at Uzhgorod on time. They left the station quickly to avoid the militia, and sat on a bench in the square outside. \\n\\nFifteen minutes later they set off. They walked two blocks. Victor asked, \\"Time?\\" He was carrying the sleeping \\"boy\\" and couldn't see his watch.\\n\\n\\"Exactly one minute to go.\\"\\n\\n\\"Slow down a bit.\\"\\n\\nAs they turned right again, Victor glanced back. Nobody. \\n\\nThen he saw the light gray Volga standing at the curb 30 feet ahead of them. The trunk was open, so he couldn't check the license plate. But it was too late to worry about that. \\n\\nHe hissed to Olga, \\"Go!\\" She went straight to the back door on the right side of the car and opened it. At the same time, Victor dumped his bag into the open trunk. Olga took a step back to let Victor into the back of the car, Elena still in his arms. Then Olga moved around to the trunk and dumped her bag next to Victor's. She closed the trunk, closed the back door, and jumped into the passenger side front seat, next to the driver. The car started moving even before the front door was shut. It accelerated and immediately made a left turn. \\n\\nAs Victor had entered the car, still holding Elena with his left arm, he had grasped the back of the seat with his right hand, pulled and lifted it, swinging it forward toward himself. Then Victor had slipped Elena into the space behind the seat and quickly arranged himself on the floor next to her.\\n\\nHe lay face up, and maneuvered the sleeping Elena onto the cushion of his right arm, with her head on his right shoulder. Extending his left hand, he managed to catch hold of the upright seat and pull it down into place. It clicked. Only then did he allow himself the luxury of a long, deep breath. \\n\\nThe next thing he heard was a man's voice speaking Russian with a heavy Polish accent. \\"Not bad, under 40 seconds. Welcome.\\"\\n\\nVictor and Olga both said: \\"Thank you, hello.\\"\\n\\nHe could feel the car making a number of turns. Dodging countersurveillance again? That doesn't make much sense, Victor thought. It's too late for that now. \\"We have to kill some time,\\" the driver said, as if reading Victor's mind. \\"We took a peek at the checkpoint today -- it's not too crowded. We don't want to be there before noon. A sergeant who's a buddy of mine will be on duty at lunchtime.\\"\\n\\n\\"Voitek, how do you pay him,\\" Victor asked, using the name supplied by his C.I.A. handlers.\\n\\nThe driver chuckled. \\"A few dollars now and then, American cigarettes, Playboy, some other stuff. I'm just a small-time operator.\\"\\n\\nBut Voitek was anything but a small-time operator, Victor knew. He was a big-time spy working the triple junction of the Polish, Ukrainian and Czechoslovakian borders, sometimes wandering into Hungary.\\n\\n\\"Hey, cargo to bridge: it's getting real hot down here. I'm afraid if we don't cross pretty soon, she's going to wake up.\\"\\n\\nVictor liked Voitek's calm response: \\"All right then, let's go. This way we'll be at the checkpoint several minutes past noon.\\" About 30 minutes earlier than planned. Victor felt the car accelerate. \\n\\nThen he heard Voitek ask Olga, \\"Nina. are you sure you've got your cover story straight?\\" \\n\\n\\"Of course.\\" She was playing the role of his girlfriend, born in Russia, now living with him in Warsaw. This was the first time she'd accompanied him on a trip. \\n\\n\\"Do you speak any Polish? It shouldn't be necessary, but just in case.\\"\\n\\n\\"No, but I speak a little Ukrainian.\\"\\n\\n\\"Good. Pure Russian sticks out around here. I have your passport. Don't go to the booth with me, but don't stay in the car, either. Get out, stretch your legs a little, but stay close to the car. Leave your door wide open.\\"\\n\\n\\"O.K.\\"\\n\\nGetting by the surly border guard cost Voitek a new Billy Joel tape. Once past the Czechoslovak guards, Victor and the still dormant Elena emerged, and the party was taken over by a team of C.I.A.  agents. A few miles past the border, as Elena was beginning to wake up, they pulled into a picnic area by a lake, where a burgundy Mercedes was waiting to take them the rest of the way. The long drive through the Slovak mountain landscape was a professional relay exercise, tense but quiet. They were in a Vienna safe house by Sunday afternoon.\\n\\nIn the safe-house garden next morning Olga was still astonished. \\n\\n\\"Victor, it all went so smoothly and easily that I almost feel like we've just been out for a long ride.\\"\\n\\n\\"Of course. That's a sign of a true world-class intelligence operation. A perfect operation always looks like one smooth ride. Outsiders cannot possibly comprehend the complexity of such an operation, how much effort and time it takes, and how many people it takes to make it a smooth ride. Just one slip-up by any one of those people could translate into a disaster.\\"\\n\\nThey flew on a commercial airliner to New York.\\n\\nOn the small, twin-engine plane to Washington, Elena seemed to be uncomfortable with the air pressure. She fidgeted for a bit and then, apparently remembering why they'd taken the trip, suddenly asked: \\"Daddy, why did your friend build his dacha so far from Moscow? Grandpa's dacha is much closer.\\"\\n\\n\\"Well, I guess he couldn't find a plot of land any closer.\\"\\n\\nElena sighed: \\"Poor thing. This is way too far for a weekend visit.\\" The Long-Secret Escape of the K.G.B.'s Cipher Hotshot"},{"year":"1925","title":"PARIS.

And as with having a baby, much advice has been written about traveling with the very young. However, these travel tips usually turn out to be less than satisfactory. I mean, traveling with small children is a real strain, and playing let's-all-count-the-yellow-license-plates on the highway is going to disguise this fact for about as long as Lamaze breathing makes you think labor pains are merely \\"discomfort.\\" So throw away all your old helpful hints about what to do when vacationing with the very young.

When eating out, do not order anything for anyone who has not yet been admitted to elementary school.     While he or she may eat something from your dinner, your child will never touch anything ordered specifically for him -- no, not even one of those special kids' dinners with the cute animal names.

And an honest Irish \\"pilebuck\\" in a shipyard is no less fair game than a Nazi saboteur. A fight is the essence of action. That's the sort of picture this new one at Loew's Criterion is.In short, \\"Secret Command\\" finds Mr. O'Brien in another of his slashing muscular roles, this time on an FBI assignment to rout out Nazis in a West Coast shipyard.

Some very basic things are occurring in this region of the world to which we have not been appropriately attentive. Just to cite three, an emerging fundamentalism, not just religious but cultural fundamentalism, the rejection of Western values. This movement of fundamentalism is especially troublesome, as it has attracted such a large number of younger people throughout this region. The enormous disparity between rich and poor, which are fueling basic animosities, and the fact that, in part, through the United States participation, the Middle East has become the parking lot for the military weapons of the world. We end up with a relatively small nation of 15 million people with a 1.3 million army, with 5,700 tanks and over 700 combat aircraft, enormous disproportion of military strength and incredible need for those weapons.   We make a basic mistake, I suggest, if we think that what we are dealing with is one man -- Saddam Hussein. I see Saddam Hussein not as the cause of those fundamental events, but rather as the guileful person who has taken advantage of those and other fundamental factors occurring in this region.   We also, drastically, have contributed to the past. We have accommodated Iraq over a period of more than a decade, accommodated in terms of covertly assisting them in the war with Iran, within the shadow of the invsion of Kuwait, continuing to extend substantial economic assistance to Iraq.   We also have contributed to the past by our failure to have a sustained commitment to a rational national energy policy, failure which has made us increasingly hostage to the circumstances in the Middle East and the personalities of today's and tomorrow's Saddam Husseins.   Looking to the future, I would suggest that as we attempt to assess how we should respond to the current crisis today we should ask ourselves what do we want to have as some of the consequences not just of the next 10 or 60 days, but over the next decade in this region and what do they say about U. S. policy around the world in this new post-cold-war era.   I am going to support the  [ Mitchell-Nunn ]  resolution, which will give the President of the United States the authority to use force. I am going to do so because I believe that the President of the United States deserves to have a presumption of correctness of his actions, and that he especially deserves to have a presumption of correctness of his actions, and that he especially deserves to have a presumption of correctness as it relates to matters of our national security and relations with other nations.  Senator Sam Nunn Democrat of Georgia   A sanctions policy is not perfect. No guarantees here. But it has to be weighed against the alternatives.    The Bush Administration is correct when they point out that sanctions do not guarantee that Iraq will leave Kuwait. But the story does not end there. What guarantees do we have that war will be brief? American casualties will be light? No one can say whether war will last five days, five weeks or five months. We know we can win and we will win. No doubt about that. No doubt about who wins this war.    Our policy and our military planning, however, cannot be based on an expectation that the war will be concluded quickly and easily. In large measure the scope and scale of the hostilities, once begun, will be determined by Iraq's willingness to absord massive punishment and to fight on.     .  .  .     Mr. President, those who support prompt military action argue that delay will allow Iraq to strengthen its defensive positions in Kuwait, thereby adding to the eventual cost of forcing Iraq out of Kuwait. A couple of observations on this point: This would have been a better argument in September of last year, and October, than it is today.    Iraq already has had five months to dig in and to fortify and they have done so in a major way. Kuwait has fortifications reminiscent of World War I. This argument also overlooks the cost to the Iraqi military of sitting in Kuwait with a 500,000-man force while its logistical support degrades because of the sanctions.     .  .  .     Supporters of prompt military action also argue that our offensive military capability will degrade if our huge force sits for months in the Saudi desert. This is also true. And for several months I have suggested that we should institute a policy of unit rotation commencing with quick reaction forces such as the 82d Airborne that might be needed on short notice elsewhere in the world. We should take full advantage of the coalition's superiority in air and sea power while establishing the capability of deploying additional ground forces to the region quickly if needed.     .  .  .     In summary, Mr. President, I believe that on balance there is a reasonable expectation that continued economic sanctions backed up by the threat of military force and international isolation can bring about Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait.     .  .  .    I believe that before this nation is committed to what may be a large-scale war, each of us in the Senate of the United States in reaching a decision which will be very personal and very difficult for all of us, we should ask ourselves a fundamental question: Will I be able to look at the parents and the wives, the husbands and the children in the eye and say that their loved ones sacrificed their lives for a cause vital to the United States and that there was no other reasonable alternative?    Mr. President, at this time I cannot.  Representative Barbara F. Vucanovich Republican of Nevada   I come from a military family. Two of my brothers were West Point graduates. My dad, a career Army officer, taught at West Point. And my grandfather, also a career Army officer and a doctor, was in the Medical Corps. One of my brothers gave his life at Anzio, and I can remember the day my mother was notified of my brother's sacrifice. It was a day that was permanently etched in my memory.   With this clearly in mind, do I look forward to casting a vote which could mean the loss of even one life of an American man or woman in the gulf? No, of course not. I'm sure none of us do. The decision to cast this vote should be made only after each of us examines our innermost conscience.    I think we need to reflect what the consequences will be, however, if we don't stop Saddam Hussein now. There can be no reward for brutal aggression. If we do nothing, and Saddam Hussein pays no price for swallowing up the country of Kuwait, destroying people's property, torturing, raping and killing innocent men and women and children, we are as guilty as he is. Representative Donald W. Riegle Jr. Democrat of Michigan   Most of the forces that we have over there on that front-line situation right now are very young","excerpt":"they're not much older than these pages sitting down here in the well of the House, in the well of the Senate. A few years older, but they haven't lived very long. And if the bullets start flying, there are going to be a lot of them that are not going to live much longer. And that's just the sheer, miserable fact of war. War is about fire and steel and people dying.   I'm convinced in my own mind that if the sons and daughters of all of us, of the President, the Vice President, the Cabinet were all over there in the Persian Gulf right now, right up on the front line and were going to be part of that first assault wave that would go on into Kuwait, I think we'd be taking more time. I think we'd be working harder on the sanctions policy. I think we'd be trying to squeeze Saddam Hussein in every other way that we could, short of a shooting war.  Senator John McCain Republican of Arizona   In this new world order, it is clear to me that if we fail to act there will be inevitably a succession of dictators, of Saddam Husseins -- of which around this globe there are an abundance, either in reality or would-be. And those dictators will see a green light, a green light for aggression, a green light for annexation of its weaker neighbors. And, indeed, over time a threat to the stability of this entire globe. Representative Byron L. Dorgan Democrat of North Dakota   It is a fig leaf to call this a multinational force. It is an American force and would be an American war. And we will decide to spend money we don't have, borrowed from our allies, to send American kids to risk their lives to protect allied oil. When will we understand that it is time for America to ask our allies to bear their fair share of the burden? And let me finally today say I'm here today because I'm concerned about Iraq, concerned about war, concerned about our role in the world. But I'm concerned about something else. I'm concerned about America. Choking on debt and threatened with an economic crisis from within, I see a President and a Congress standing tall, exhibiting steely resolve to stand up and talk tough to a tin-horn dictator in the Persian Gulf; willing to borrow money from abroad and risk our troops' lives to protect our allies' oil. Senator Joseph I. Lieberman Democrat of Connecticut   The issue before us is not to pick a day or time for hostilities to begin or to determine how a war is waged. No, that, in my opinion, is the clear responsibility of the President, as Commander in Chief under Article II of our Constitution.    The issue before the Congress under Article I, Section 8 is whether or not we authorize the President to use force to achieve our goals in the Persian Gulf -- whether or not we think that war is justified -- if the President chooses to wage it. On that issue, I will vote to authorize the President to have the power to go to war. I will do so in the knowledge that war may indeed be the result and that many good people may die. But I will cast that vote in the hopes that by so doing, I will make the prospects of peace more real. . . . Representative Major R. Owens Democrat of Brooklyn   Nearly one-third of our soldiers in Operation Desert Shield are African-American, many of them with families in districts like mine, the 12th Congressional District of Brooklyn. My district is the 10th poorest district in the nation.    My district is the second -- has the second-largest number of African-Americans. Young African-American men and women are three times more likely to be in the armed forces and involved in this impending war in the sand as young whites are. There is a reason for this.    When people can't get jobs they find the Army and the Navy and the other military units as an opportunity to be utilized. There are many very bright young people who never looked for a job but who are recruited from high school and told that you can go to college after you go through the military and get those advantages. And there are many -- there are a few others who are officers, quite a number are officers -- are African-American men and women who went to military academies or they used the benefits of the R.O.T.C. as the only way they could make it. For this reason you have this disproportionate number.    These are the same people who are penalized when President Bush refuses to pass a civil rights bill because it has a quota -- he claims it has a quota. There is some kind of ugly reverse quota operating when 33 percent of the troops on the front line are poor and African-American.  Representative Ike Skelton Democrat of Missouri   The issue, Mr. Speaker, is whether the dream of Franklin Roosevelt will be fulfilled by reliance on the United Nations and the rule of law. This is a grave issue. It is, however, but a replay of the past. The faces are different but the issues and the challenges are the same.    So the question is, have we learned anything from the lessons of history. It's 1936, Adolf Hitler entered the Rhineland. Those great powers of the day, Great Britain and France, did nothing. Nineteen thirty-eight, Adolf Hitler demanded part of Czechoslovakia and got it, based upon a promise of no more territorial demands. It was Great Britain's Chamberlain, the Prime Minister, who returned from the Munich meeting with Adolf Hitler, proclaiming \\"peace in our time.\\" How wrong he was.   The lesson in history of which I speak is found in the phrase, \\"We should have stopped him when we could.\\" How many British, French and, yes, American families said that about Adolf Hitler after World War II?   Applying that sad lesson of history, we must stop Saddam Hussein now. Senator Tom Harkin Democrat of Iowa   Certainly naked aggression must be responded to, but what about a few weeks ago, when there was naked aggression in Chad by Libya? We didn't rush over there with our troops. How about Syria? Not too long ago, Syria -- now one of our allies -- Syria went into Lebanon and massacred 750 civilians. Well, that's naked aggression. We didn't do anything about it. Now Assad's on our side.    What about Indonesia's bloody excursion into East Timor, where they basically wiped out a country, killed a lot of people? We didn't do anything. Or when Saddam Hussein gassed the Kurds in his own country. That's naked aggression. We didn't do anything.   So what does this mean that we want to stop naked aggression. Does this mean that we are now going to say that the United States will indeed become the policeman of the world, and that we will respond to every instance of naked aggression? Or does it mean that we're just going to kind of pick and choose which ones we want to respond to or not.    How about the Soviets putting down the Lithuanians. Are we going to respond to that? I dare say we're not. So we're just going to kind of pick and choose which kind of naked aggression we want. Representative Michael Bilirakis Republican of Florida   I earnestly believe that what we will decide in the coming days goes far beyond the price of gas or the re-establishment of a desert sheikhdom, as I have heard alleged. No, what hangs in the balance here is nothing less than global order, the legitimacy of recognized boundaries around the world and the primacy of international law.     .  .  .     We in this chamber would like nothing better than to believe that Saddam Hussein will be convinced by economic sanctions to leave Kuwait in peace. However, I have seen absolutely no evidence of this in the past six months, and without the threat of armed force being used against him at any time, I do not foresee Saddam altering his course of pillage, murder, rape and destruction. Representative John Lewis Democrat of Georgia   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak for peace. The decision we are about to make is too much to be made by one mortal. The representatives of the people must participate in this grave decision. These are very difficult times for all of us, yet we have a moral obligation, a mandate and a mission to do what we can to prevent war. In our time, we have seen too much violence, too much conflict and too many killings in the Middle East. We have an opportunity, my colleagues, to slow down this rush to war. Representative Gerry E. Studds Democrat of Massachusetts   I am unwilling to put my faith or American lives in the hands of those who tell us so confidently that a war will be quick, easy and successful. Yes, we can probably win. But we do not know how long it will take to win. We do not know how many American soldiers and innocent civilians will die. We do not know how many young men and women and children will be left without homes, without parents, without arms or legs or eyes, without the capacity to live a normal life. No computer, no politician, no so-called expert, not even our best and brightest, can do more than guess at the human costs of this war.    We cannot predict the economic costs of violence in the Persian Gulf. It will mean higher and perhaps far higher oil prices for God knows how long. The reason we are in the Persian Gulf is oil -- to protect our economy. By surrendering to war we will in that sense surely and ironically defeat ourselves.    And finally, if we go to war now, we will never know whether that war was necessary. Think about that. Think about the lives that'll be cut short, the families that will be shattered, the heartbreak that will be endured and ask yourself how much greater the pain will be if we are not certain whether those sacrifices had to occur.     .  .  .     Mr. Speaker, our choice today is whether to persevere on the path of patience and determination and peace or to stray from that path into the wilderness of war. Whether to walk together the extra mile or the extra two miles in pursuit of a bloodless resolution to this crisis or to declare war and fight war and count the bodies and bury the bodies and never know whether a single American soldier really had to die.  Representative James H. Bilray Democrat of Nevada   My own family disagrees with me on this vote. My daughter who is a junior in high school last night spent an hour at dinner telling me what a bad vote I was making. My daughter who is a senior in college spent 15-20 minutes just a few minutes ago telling me this was the worst vote I'd ever make. I understand their anguish. I understand the anguish of my parish priest who walked out of Mass this week and told me, please, let's not give the President the power to fight.    But I believe if we spit in the President's face, and that we deny him the ability to use whatever weapons are at his disposal to achieve peace, then we are going to cause war. Our only hope is that by giving the President the right to use force, he will not have to use that force.     Representative Joseph P. Kennedy 2d  Democrat of Massachusetts   This country, and everybody in this chamber, ought to be willing to look at themselves in the mirror and say whether or not we're here to protect some way of life that allows us to drive cars that get minimum gas mileage, that allows us to live in houses that are energy sieves, that allows us to work in buildings such as this one that are energy sieves as well, in order to protect some notion of a conservative aspect of our history that says that that's capitalism.     .  .  .     And lastly, we're there to help our so-called Kuwaiti and Saudi friends. Need I remind the members of this chamber what the Kuwaitis and Saudis did to this country in 1973? Did to us again in 1979? We're there to protect these so-called friends? Ladies and gentlemen, these fickle friends have never proven that they are worth the kind of price that President Bush is committing.     .  .  .     I understand that at the end of his remarks, Mr. Solomon from New Yorkquoted my uncle, President Kennedy, as suggesting that somehow or another there would be a tone of appeasement if he had not responded in the way he did to the Cuban missile crisis in 1962. I would just point out that President Kennedy established an embargo against Cuba in 1962. That is exactly what we are advocating on this side in 1990, is to create an embargo that will work. Representative Gary L. Ackerman Democrat of Queens   This is not why I came here, to vote for war. Yet over the last several weeks I have found myself at war with my own conscience. All my life, I've decried violence and all who commit it. All my life I've been and I am a peacemonger. I opposed Vietnam, and even Grenada. I oppose the death penalty. I don't think boxing is a sport. I'm even against killing animals without purpose. Toy guns and war games have always been banned from my house. I'm a father who wants his children to grow up in a world at peace.    .  .  .    There were lessons in Vietnam. Saddam Hussein thinks he's learned one, that the United States has no national resolve, that Americans will do anything short of shedding blood, that the Congress will pick apart the President and undermine our troops and our strategy, and let him have his violent way.   Mr. Speaker, let us learn him a new lesson. The best chance for peace that we have is for a message to be sent from here today that the American people through their Congress is behind their President and their soldiers and are willing to stand up to his vicious aggression.    .  .  .     I will not cast this vote with any sense of joy, I tremble at the thought of playing God and having to cast it. The only thing I fear more would be sitting on the rocker on the porch if God grants me the years to reach retirement, and having some little girl, who hopefully would look a little like her grandmother, look at me and ask, \\"Grandpa, why didn't anyone stop him?\\" Senator John Glenn Democrat of Ohio   Certainly Iraq is an ideal embargo target. And if the embargo ends in failure, we still have the military option. And I will fully support that course at that time. I believe the Persian Gulf is that important. But to again loose the terrors of war and the thousands of lives that hang in the balance, should not be the first resort. And just saying that Kuwait was attacked or that hostages have been mistreated will not be of much solace if flag-draped coffins for both male and female soldiers and sailors and marines and airmen line up in the hangars in Dover, Del. Senator Christopher S. Bond Republican of Missouri   Now I know that compelling arguments can be and have been made, arguments which are popularly appealing, arguments against war. Here's a good one, and I quote: \\"How horrible, fantastic, incredible it is that we should be digging trenches and trying on gas masks because of a quarrel in a faraway country between people of whom we know nothing. It seems still more impossible that a quarrel which had already been settled in principle, should be the subject of war.\\" In case you don't recognize that quote, it was from Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain in a London broadcast on Sept. 27, 1938.    I believe the better policy then and the policy -- better policy now was summed up by Winston Churchill in the dark days leading up to World War II. Churchill said civilization will not last, freedom will not survive, peace will not be kept unless a very large majority of mankind unites together to defend them and show themselves possessed of a constabulary power before which barbaric and atavistic forces will stand in awe.    I believe the reason we must adopt the resolution supporting the position of the U.N. resolution is very simple and straightforward. The simple reason we must act is that we cannot allow Saddam Hussein to profit from his aggression. The world stands poised at a critical moment in history. The cold war has come to a close and the world is entering into a new era. . . . If we allow Saddam Hussein to succeed in this venture -- the first of the truly post-cold-war era -- we will pay the price for years to come. . . .  Representative Barbara Boxer Democrat of California   I have seen the weapons that are arrayed against Iraq. I've seen them up close, in the Persian Gulf. They're awesome! We can inflict the ultimate pain on the people of Iraq, make no mistake. We will win this war -- quickly! Maybe two weeks, maybe two months -- that's quick. Maybe at most six months -- that's quick, I guess.    But my colleagues, it won't come free. There's a huge price if we choose this route, even in the best of circumstances. The price is in body bags, in babies killed, in an uncertain, unstable Middle East even after the crisis. In a decade that will be lost as we once again have put our resources into war and weapons and rob our people of what they need in this country.   I had a community meeting in my district, I had two in one day. A thousand people came out. I've never seen anything like it. We voted on how they would vote on a resolution to go to war and 95 percent voted no. That's my district in California.

Ms. Souza started off, performing in a quartet that included the pianist Bruce Barth, the bassist Scott Colley and the drummer Jeff Ballard; her first tune was Antonio Carlos Jobim's ''Chega de Saudade,'' and immediately this was musicians' music. The whole band played for the four-bar introduction, and then bass and drums abruptly dropped out for the verse, leaving only the melody and Mr. Barth's elegant ornamentation. Everyone re-entered for the chorus, but the message was plain: this is music under strict control, and the point was reconfirmed by the song's slow progression along a slow upward grade of intensity until the last note.

I was 5 years old and we lived in a large Brooklyn brownstone. In early December the mailman pulled the big basement bell, sending a clamor throughout the house, I rushed downstairs, then up again to announce the arrival of the barrel. It was from Maggie, a former maid, who had run the household until she left to marry a man named Major Andrews. Every year around Christmas Maggie and the Major picked, packed and shipped the holly from their home in Virginia.    The barrel they sent was as big as I was, filled to the brim with holly, then covered with burlap. We didn't unpack the holly, but left it at the wrought-iron gate where the cold air kept it fresh. Now the white winter curtains were hung and the red wreaths were put in the windows. Now the marzipan pigs were purchased, the fruitcakes mixed and baked in the big iron stove. At last it was close enough to Christmas to bring in the holly. Grandpa supervised and tied some to the vestibule light, Grandma tied a bunch to the newel post. I was allowed to stand on a stool and place sprays on the marble mantles in the parlors. The big silver bowl was lifted from its pantry shelf, polished and filled with holly on the dining room table.   A week before Christmas we took bunches and set out on the Vanderbilt Avenue trolley for Greenwood Cemetery, where my parents placed sprigs on the tombstones. Maggie sent the holly every year until she was too old. Today, the only holly I see is imitation.  --    RUTH WARD   Dear Diary:     Bernard Siegfried is there when the Fifth Avenue bus stops in front of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

For many student-athletes, the year has produced its share of highs and lows, athletically, academically and socially. Samantha Stevenson followed Jeff Salzenstein, the captain and No. 1 tennis player on the Stanford men's team, during his junior year. It was a year that concluded this weekend with the National Collegiate Athletic Association team and individual championships. \\nSEPTEMBER\\n\\nThe week before school starts, Salzenstein drives his 1983 Honda to Bakersfield, Calif., for a pro satellite tournament. Not for computer points, he says, just to get in some matches. \\"The place was intense, cut-throat,\\" Salzenstein observes. \\"I'm going to the best college in the world","excerpt":"they're trying to eat. Not a memorable experience.\\"\\n\\nAfter the tournament, Salzenstein heads for Palo Alto, Calif., and his Stanford fraternity house. He arrives at 10 P.M. and finds 15 of his friends drinking beer. Nothing out of the ordinary. \\"It's a diverse group,\\" he says. \\"We have soccer players, surfers and clean-cut guys. Guys who like to party but are pretty serious. It's not a crazy animal house; it's not clean either.\\"\\n\\nHe calls his house a \\"college kid's fantasy -- fullcourt basketball, Jacuzzi, pool table, satellite dish, sauna, 55 guys under one roof in a split level. College is not the real world.\\" \\n\\nSEPT. 28 Salzenstein, who has a full scholarship, declares his major -- economics -- and signs up for two economics classes, Rise of Industrial Asia and Macro Economics.\\nOCTOBER\\n\\n\\"There's not that much dating at Stanford,\\" Salzenstein says. \\"Most people are driven and set on goals. It's hard to ask a girl on a date. It's different here compared to big state schools where they have date parties. We stay in groups. My motivating factor this year is to work hard in tennis.\\"\\n\\nLast season, Salzenstein lost the deciding team match in the nationals to Jon Leach of the Pac-10 rival Southern Cal, 6-7, 6-3, 6-3, a defeat he termed \\"devastating.\\" This season, the first big tournament is the All-American in the second week of October in Austin, Tex., the \\"best college party town in America.\\" Salzenstein, who will turn 21 on Oct. 14, is determined to enjoy himself there. He does, and reaches the semifinals. \\nNOVEMBER\\n\\nIn the Rolex Regional at Berkeley, a college tournament whose past champions include the Stanford alums John McEnroe and Tim Mayotte, Salzenstein is expected to win as the No. 1 seeded player. In the semis, he faces Stanford freshman Paul Goldstein, the reigning national boys' 18 champion. \\"There's pressure to play my own teammate and someone younger than I am,\\" Salzenstein says. Especially when your own coach is hyping the matchup to get bodies in the stands. Salzenstein defeats Goldstein in straight sets. The coach, Dick Gould, moves the final to Palo Alto and bills it as another Stanford freshman, Scott Humphries -- \\"the guy who won junior Wimbledon\\" -- against Salzenstein, the self-described \\"old guy.\\" Salzenstein prevails, 6-4, 3-6, 7-6 (7-5). \\n\\nSalzenstein is impressed with how Gould \\"stayed separate from the match. He knows when to tighten and when to let go. I respect him for that.\\"\\n\\nThe college rankings come out Thanksgiving week and Salzenstein celebrates his No. 6 national ranking by going to Hawaii on a Gould-arranged junket for the men's and women's teams, who will play the University of Hawaii. Salzenstein gets to have his turkey and eat it, too: his mother and stepfather come, the team loves them, and \\"Salzy\\" is elected team captain.\\n\\nBack at school, the dating scene picks up: \\"Sylena is her name.\\"\\nDECEMBER\\n\\nAgainst a backdrop of finals and formals, Salzenstein thinks that he and Sylena may be more than friends now. \\"Could be trouble,\\" he observes, getting nervous about stretching his commitments. \\"Frat. School. Tennis. And now this girl thing.\\" It's almost a relief to go home to a family Christmas in Englewood, Colo., to party and \\"use my I.D. frequently.\\" About the girl thing: Sylena calls from Boston, and \\"we talked often.\\"\\nJANUARY\\n\\nAt the first college tournament of the winter in Palm Springs, Calif., Salzenstein realizes his holiday partying \\"didn't pay off.\\" After a sobering first-round loss and a second-round dismissal in the consolation event, Salzenstein calls his parents for support and rededicates himself. \\"This is definitely a wake-up call,\\" he notes. \\"Pro tennis is my goal. My first two years of school, I just wanted Stanford and fraternity and parties. Now tennis is bigger than anything in my life.\\" Onward he goes.\\nFEBRUARY\\n\\nThe winter grind has begun. There's travel and tournaments every weekend. Classes for the quarter have started. \\"Fall is over and it seems far away,\\" Salzenstein says.  \\"It's no longer one big good time. My mood depends on how good my tennis is, and it isn't good. Win, I'm feeling great. Lose, I feel bad. I'm down in the dumps about everything.\\" \\n\\nIn Seattle, he loses in the semis to Southern Cal's Brett Hansen, 7-6, 6-0, after serving for the first set. In the second, he admits, \\"I mentally broke down.\\" \\n\\nIn his first season of being No. 1 on the nation's top team, Salzenstein has hit rock bottom. Gould tries everything to help. He consoles him; he gets tough with him; he appeals to his leadership responsibilities. \\n\\n\\"I knew he was right,\\" Salzenstein says. \\"I'm feeling selfish and sorry for myself.  I'm extremely unhappy playing tennis. Fall was so good. Now what's wrong? Too much fun and not enough hard work, I guess. I'm top 10 in college tennis. I should do more and know more.\\"\\n\\nThe losses pile up: On Feb. 2, it's Rob Chess of Duke; on Feb. 6, it's a 6-1, 6-1 drubbing by Jonathan Stark, a Stanford alum, at a pro tournament in San Jose. What's the difference between the men's tour and college tennis, a reporter asks Stark. Stark says he drinks less beer now. \\"So true,\\" says Salzenstein. \\n\\nSalzenstein's father, Richard, takes him out to dinner in San Jose and tries to lift his spirits. \\"Dad told me I could turn this slump around,\\" Salzenstein says. \\"He told me success is a journey, not a destination. That there's a saying: 'Do not fear the winds of adversity; remember, a kite rises against the wind rather than with it.'\\n\\n\\"Dad is fairly religious. He told me any time I wanted to ask God for help it would be helpful. But I want to do it on my own. God is not a huge part of my life. I guess it happens to a lot of college kids that way.\\" \\n\\nFEB. 11 Winning makes a difference. With his father in the stands, outdoors at Stanford, Salzenstein beats the No. 1 player in the country, the University of Miami's Srdan Muskatirovic, 6-3, 6-2. Muskatirovic has a bad ankle, but the match is still \\"a turning point\\" to Salzenstein. He credits a fraternity brother with helping him to focus on his game by concentrating on his breathing.  \\"That simple,\\" Salzenstein says. \\"Exhale. Inhale. Against Srdan, that's what I did. The whole match I thought about breathing.\\" \\n\\nAlthough his national collegiate ranking drops to No. 9, Salzenstein feels his form returning. All the advice from parents, friends and coaches begins to make sense. \\n\\nSalzenstein can even find virtue in injury. At the National Team Indoors in Louisville in late February, Stanford downs Notre Dame, Mississippi, U.C.L.A. and Georgia; Salzenstein wins three of his four matches, despite a pulled hip flexor muscle. \\n\\n\\"I'm hitting shots I know I can hit instead of shots I don't own,\\" he says. \\"Like Coach said, 'You're good, not great.' \\" His only loss is to Mahesh Bhupathi of Mississippi by way of Oman, who is No. 270 in the world on the men's pro computer. Salzenstein reflects that over 50 percent of college players, and most No. 1's, are foreigners. Dick Gould only recruits Americans. \\"It's nothing against foreigners,\\" Salzenstein says, \\"but they take scholarships from Americans.\\"\\nMARCH\\n\\nOn a \\"dead week at Stanford,\\" the week before finals, Salzenstein flies to a tennis academy in Tampa, Fla., to work out with Humphries, his teammate. Later that week, Salzenstein tests himself against the pros at the Lipton International. He doesn't have time to study; he wins two matches in the qualifying before losing creditably, 7-5, 6-3, to Sergio Casal in the last round. Although Salzenstein admits to nerves, he thinks, \\"I'm not that far from making it to the next level.\\" He has decided to take the fall semester off to play on the pro tour. \\n\\nThe College Kid sounds dazzled by the excess and glamour of the pro tour: \\"Food. Drinks. All complimentary. Imagine -- for free. Every main draw player gets a Lexus to drive. All you have to do is win tennis matches.\\" Imagine.\\n\\nBut he is still a college kid, and with only two days to study for exams, he doesn't do well. His grade point average drops from 3.0 to 2.5. \\"My parents say they understand,\\" he says. \\"I've been away for tennis 7 out of 10 weekends this semester.\\"\\n\\nAfter finals, his fraternity brothers go to Cabo San Lucas in Mexico for spring break.  Salzenstein stays on campus for daily practice from 10 A.M. to 2 P.M. \\nAPRIL\\n\\nOn U.C.L.A.-U.S.C. weekend in Los Angeles, April 7-8, the team falls behind, 3-1, against U.C.L.A. The three remaining Stanford singles players, including Salzenstein, are trailing in their matches. They all win. Stanford 4, U.C.L.A. 3. The next day, Stanford beats U.S.C., 5-2. Salzenstein avenges his February loss to Hansen. Gould tells his young team -- two freshmen, no seniors -- that only three times in 29 years has Stanford swept both dual matches against their Southern California rivals.\\n\\nAPRIL 21-22 Gould's team goes for the sweep in front of a sellout crowd of 1,000 at Stanford tennis stadium. The atmosphere is electric. No brinksmanship this time as Stanford beats both schools, 5-2. As for Salzenstein, he downs U.S.C.'s Hansen again. The next day, he stops the U.C.L.A. freshman Justin Gimmelstob, 6-4, 6-4. \\"Imagine, we finished this year at 23-0,\\" Salzenstein reflects with satisfaction, \\"the first undefeated regular season for a Stanford team since 1977-78 when John McEnroe played here as a freshman. Gould says no one understands how tough that is.\\"\\n\\nAPRIL 26 It's the 96th year of the tournament in Ojai in Southern California. The Stanford players make the 5 1/2-hour drive, three of them cramped in a compact. They stay, two to a room, at a rundown motel with cockroaches and no air conditioning. Gould likes staying there. \\"Tradition,\\" he says. Salzenstein notes other traditions. \\"Ojai is tradition: the beer on the lanai back at the motel,\\" he says. \\"Lots of trees. It's old, prestigious. It's important to win here.\\"\\n\\nAfter injuring his back, Salzenstein divides his tournament between the training table and the courts, eventually losing to Michael Hill in the semis.\\nMAY\\n\\nEarly May goes by in a haze of keg parties, music, midterms and Salzenstein's developing friendship with Sylena. They hang out together and study together.\\"\\n\\n\\"We're like best friends,\\" he says, \\"and we've gotten closer as the year's gone by. But it's not serious. Tennis is serious. We don't hold hands. It's the first relationship for me in college. I'm open with my parents.  They know I'll do the right thing.\\"\\n\\nOn a good-news, bad-news day, Salzenstein struggles through his Colonialism in the Third World midterm but learns he is back up to No. 6 in the country. He has earned one of the first 32 automatic berths into the N.C.A.A. singles tournament in Athens, Ga. Humphries and Goldstein each get an at-large berth. Stanford plays Duke in the first round of the team championship. The team is itching to leave for Georgia.\\n\\nOnce again, Salzenstein appreciates Gould's talents. \\"He stands on the backside of the four courts,\\" he notes. \\"You can hear him from two courts down. He yells out whether you're doing something right or wrong. All week he's been talking about 'getting this Big Red Machine going.' \\n\\n\\"He talks about Stanford peaking at this time of year. Other teams know it. People think championships grow on trees. But you can't take it for granted. Gould says not all of us will play our best. He says how we play under adversity will determine if we win. \\n\\n\\"He calls Athens our home away from home. The fans bark like dogs, but Georgia loves Stanford: It's called respect. Stanford loves Georgia: Every team gets assigned a sorority, and the girls bring soft drinks and candy to the rooms. Twelve days in the South in quest of a championship.\\" What's not to love?\\nMAY 11-16 THE TEAM CHAMPIONSHIPS. In front of Team Salzenstein -- his mother, his stepfather, his sister, his dad and his girlfriend -- Stanford downs Duke, 4-1, and Mississippi State, 4-0, in the second round. In both rounds, Salzenstein and Grant Elliott win pivotal doubles matches.\\n\\nAgainst U.C.L.A. in the semifinals, Salzenstein and Elliott win again, but the Bruins gain the critical early edge. \\"Coach looked everyone in the eye,\\" Salzenstein says. \\"He said: 'I expect six singles victories. Everyone will win.' He emphasized 'will.' We came through.\\"\\n\\nIn the team final, Stanford faces Mississippi, which upset Georgia. \\"We play our matches as if we are on fire,\\" Salzenstein says. Stanford races to a 4-0 victory. \\"I was so overwhelmed,\\" he says, \\"I cried. I never cried before. It's the first national championship for me. The 13th for Gould.\\" \\nMAY 17-19 THE INDIVIDUAL CHAMPIONSHIPS. Salzenstein advances to the semifinals, the last Stanford man left in singles, downing New Mexico's Tad Berkowitz, Colorado's Mark Bauer, Miami's Muskatirovic, and Fredrick Bergh of Fresno State and Sweden. Then, he loses to U.S.C.'s Hansen in three sets. All in all, it has been a very good year.\\n\\n\\"It's night and day, the player I was last year and this year,\\" says Salzenstein. \\"I've made tremendous strides in my backcourt game, and I've really learned how to serve and volley. My ultimate goal was to win, but this sets me up for next year. I'll be back.\\" BACKTALK;\\nBooks, Beer and Volleys: A Year in the Life of a College Standout"},{"year":"2000","title":"THESE enumerators aren't knocking on any doors","excerpt":"they're trying to make themselves as inconspicuous as possible.

SPECTER Why not take your entire program to the FISA court within the broad parameters of what is reasonable and constitutional and ask the FISA court to approve it or disapprove it?    MR.

In terms of why not go to the FISA court, once the determination was made that neither the Constitution nor FISA prohibited the use of this tool, then the question becomes for the commander in chief which of the tools is appropriate given a particular circumstance. And we studied very carefully the requirements of the Constitution under the Fourth Amendment, we studied very carefully what FISA provides for.      As I said in my statement, we believe that FISA does anticipate that another statute could permit electronic surveillance -- --    MR. SPECTER O.K., you think you're right, but there are a lot of people who think you're wrong.      As a matter of public confidence, why not take it to the FISA court? What do you have to lose if you're right?    MR. GONZALES What I can say, Senator, is that we are continually looking at ways that we can work with the FISA court in being more efficient and more effective in fighting the war on terror. Obviously, we would consider, and are always considering, methods of fighting the war effectively against Al Qaeda.    MR. SPECTER Well, speaking for myself, I would urge the president to take this matter to the FISA court. They're experts. They'll maintain the secrecy. And let's see what they have to say. . . .    MR. LEAHY Let me ask you this. Under your interpretation of this, can you go in and do mail searches? Can you go into e-mails? Can you open mail? Can you do ''black bag'' jobs?    MR.

It's a way to send radio shows directly to you in MP3 format -- sort of like TiVo for Internet radio. To participate, download a handy application (for either PC or Mac) at www.ipodder.org. Then set it to the programs you're interested in -- perhaps you want to make sure you always have the latest version of WFMU's ''Antique Phonograph Music Program''? -- and as soon as each is available, it will be automatically sent to your computer's audio player (iTunes or otherwise). Copyrighted music is off limits for this kind of sharing, which is why many podcasters are making addictive programming out of original material.

Off Broadway, ''White Chocolate,'' a comedy at the Century Center for the Performing Arts, wraps today, and ''Bug,'' in which two troubled lovers are attacked by bugs, closes at the Barrow Street Theater. On Broadway, ''Wonderful Town'' winds down at the Al Hirschfeld Theater; ''Whoopi'' has worn herself weary at the Lyceum; and ''Pacific Overtures,'' with B.D. Wong at Studio 54, we hardly knew ye.

TINA'S UN-BIRTHDAY      Logic suggests that Tina Turner can turn 60 only so many times, but here comes another: tonight, the Long Island PBS affiliate WLIW broadcasts ''Celebrate: The Best of Tina Turner,'' which includes a live recording of her 60th birthday concert in 2000.  WLIW, 8 p.m.    MONDAY 1|31    THE RISQUÉ PHOTOGRAPHER      Not so long ago, Japanese curators who exhibited the photographs of Nobuyoshi Araki risked arrest. Today, his portraits of women clad and unclad aren't considered criminal, but they're clearly still controversial. In the documentary ''Arakimentari,'' the exuberant artist, now in his mid-60's, comes across as something of a lech, but his slightly perverse jolliness is utterly contagious.  ImaginAsian Theater, 239 East 59th Street; 3:15 and 8:15 p.m.; $10. (Through Feb. 3.)    CHOPIN THE GREAT      Robert Kapilow is a composer (he set Dr. Seuss's ''Green Eggs and Ham'' to music) and a conductor, but his best-fitting hat may be that of a public classical enthusiast. Tonight he will discuss Chopin's études, with Shai Wosner at the piano providing musical accompaniment and supporting evidence.  Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center; 7:30 p.m.; $30, $20 for students.    ROCK IN THE VALLEY      The Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival provides an excellent annual excuse to head into the desert of Southern California for rock 'n' roll (and techno and rap and more).

TODAY'S GENDER-BENDING CD'S      ''Kiki and Herb Will Die for You at Carnegie Hall'' (Evolver, $19.98), a recording of the supposedly final performance last September by the faux lounge act of Justin Bond and Kenny Mellman, is a two-disc, three-hour ride over the bumpy territory between ironic pop music and sincere cabaret. Another act fronted by a male downtown diva, Antony and the Johnsons, releases a CD today; ''I Am a Bird Now'' (Secretly Canadian, $15.98) is equally a tribute to sincerity: it includes the song ''You Are My Sister,'' recorded with Antony's childhood hero Boy George.    HOLLYWOOD'S LEADING MAN      The legendary producer Irving Thalberg died in 1936 at the age of 37. Though he was the most famous producer of his day -- and perhaps even ours -- he never attached his name to a film, a strong contrast to this Oscar season's battle for credits. A documentary by Robert Trachtenberg highlights Thalberg's contribution to the films under his control.  Turner Classic Movies, 8 p.m. and repeated at midnight    WEDNESDAY 2|2    DOUBLE PINTER      The first of two plays by Harold Pinter opens tonight. ''The Birthday Party'' -- which was met with horror and disdain at its premiere in 1958 -- will be followed tomorrow by his 1964 play ''The Homecoming,'' which is, by intention, perhaps the bleakest theatrical experience possible.

''Elia -- A Story of an Ostrich Chick'' is a nature documentary of sorts, in which his two children migrate as flabby, flightless birds. ''Wild Boy'' investigates Mr. Ben-Ner's overlapping roles as father, pedagogue and director.  Postmasters, 459 West 19th Street, Chelsea; 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; free.    ARCHITECTS OF MEXICO CITY      ''Mexico City Dialogues'' is the first international exhibition organized by the 15-month-old Center for Architecture, the storefront home of the New York chapter of the American Institute of Architects. Next to this show about 12 young Mexico City architects, a smaller exhibition is devoted to the New York work of the firm TEN Arquitectos, whose super space-age Visual and Performing Arts Library in Brooklyn is expected to open in 2008.  Center for Architecture, 536 La Guardia Place, near Bleecker Street, Greenwich Village; 9 a.m. to 8 p.m., free.

Congregation Rodeph Sholom, 7 West 83rd St., 7 p.m., $18 in advance, $20 at the door.    YOU COMMISSIONED IT, YOU LISTEN TO IT      The sixth annual People's Commissioning Fund Concert, founded by Bang on a Can, features three world premieres -- by Carla Kihlstedt, J.G. Thirlwell and Cynthia Hopkins, whose ''Accidental Nostalgia'' recently played at St. Ann's Warehouse. Philip Glass will also perform his 1969 piece ''Music in Similar Motion.''  Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, 8 p.m., $20    FRIDAY 2|4    DISPOSABLE HEROES      ''Disposable Men,'' created and performed by the cleverly wired performance artist James Scruggs, explores stereotypes of black men using traditional monologues and nontraditional technology -- like video projections and laser-assisted polling, by which audience members will vote on the fate of various characters.  Here Arts Center, 145 Avenue of the Americas, at Dominick Street, South Village; 8:30 p.m.; $20. (Through Feb. 12)    ADOLESCENT TERRORS      David Lynch's ''Blue Velvet,'' in which a young Kyle MacLachlan's adolescent libido is no match for the horrors of the adult world, plays tonight at the Sunshine Cinema. Over at Two Boots Pioneer Theater, Paul Verhoeven's half-satire, half-action film ''Starship Troopers'' sends the fresh-faced teens Denise Richards and Casper Van Dien into a horrific, bloody war against insects from space.  Sunshine Cinema, 143 East Houston Street, Lower East Side; midnight; $10.50. (Also Friday)  Two Boots Pioneer Theater, 155 East Third Street, East Village; midnight; $9. (Also Feb. 11)    SOUTH AFRICAN GOSPEL      The Soweto Gospel Choir released a CD last week ($17.98, Shanachie) of rambunctious music, performed in a half-dozen languages, that draws from both African and African diaspora styles. Tonight the group will bring it live to Carnegie Hall.  Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall; 10 p.m., tickets from $30 to $42.    BEETHOVEN FANS DO MOZART      A quintet of music lovers from Colleagues in Concert, which is largely composed of members of the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra, takes up Mozart's Piano Quartet in G minor, some Schubert and a rarely performed Joachim Raff piano quintet. On piano: Susan Kagan, the president of the New York chapter of the American Beethoven Society.  New York Public Library for the Performing Arts at Lincoln Center; 3 p.m.; free.    SATURDAY 2|5    KNITTING SPACE      Mathematicians have long struggled to find a comprehensible way to convey the concept of hyperbolic space. But it took Daina Taimina, a Cornell University professor, and some synthetic yarn to get it right. She knits models that look like giant crenelated flowers collapsing on themselves -- as rendered by your grandmother. They've been used to explain advanced mathematics to fifth graders, but they also function as art: like those of many an artist-inventor before her, her labor-intensive models are extremely pretty. She and her husband (and colleague), David Henderson, present them in a high-tech show-and-tell moderated by the director of the Institute for Figuring (which can be found at www.theiff.org).  The Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea; 5 p.m.; $5.    WOOSTER COMEBACK      The original cast of the Wooster Group's ''House/Lights,'' first produced in 1999, reappears for a run through April 10. The famously disorienting production makes a mash-up of Gertrude Stein's 1938 opera libretto for ''Dr. Faustus Lights the Lights'' and the 1964 Joseph P. Mawra film ''Olga's House of Shame.'' The first preview is tonight.  St. Ann's Warehouse, 38 Water St., Brooklyn, 8 p.m., $27.    HARRIET TUBMAN IN BROOKLYN      It's ''First Saturday'' at the Brooklyn Museum, when the party always goes until 11 p.m. Harriet Tubman, an all-improvisation jazz trio, plays at 7:30 to accompany the museum's current show of Kehinde Wiley paintings, which are tripped-out, hip-hop spiritual psychedelica. And don't be disturbed by all the Marilyn Monroes: there'll be a look-alike contest at 8 and a screening of ''The Seven Year Itch'' at 9.  200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Prospect Heights; 6 to 11 p.m.; $8, $5 for students and 64+, free for children under 12.

You can use your dream time to ''make your writing more descriptive,'' for researchers have discovered ''that you can hear, smell, touch, and taste in your dreams; often, you dream in color.''   This is a ''normal'' dream. In a ''breakthrough'' dream, ''you may realize insights or come up with solutions to problems.'' You plan the dream you want by immersing yourself in your subject for at least four days, saturating your mind with it. And you must believe in your oneiric powers. ''Be as confident,'' Miss Ross advises, ''as a master baker with a cake in the oven.''   A writer I know has become a devotee of ''How to Write While You Sleep.'' ''Yes, it works,'' he said, ''but it does change your life in unexpected ways. Like I used to get out once in a while with old buddies or a lady friend - but no more.

Jean-Yves Thibaudet, a 31-year-old French pianist, is currently campaigning for Ravel on both fronts. His recordings of the composer's solo piano canon were recently released by London Records, and on Sunday afternoon he played the first of two Ravel concerts at the 92d Street Y, 1495 Lexington Avenue. The conclusion is scheduled for Dec. 6.    Mr. Thibaudet's recital confirmed what his recordings suggest: that he is a first-class Ravelian, though not a conventional one. The most immediately striking attribute of his playing is that he avoids the overpedaling that pianists often use to evoke the sensuality and hazy Impressionism of Ravel's chromatic washes. Instead, he shines a bright light into the music's textures, revealing its inner workings without stripping it of its mystery. He makes the distinction between sentimentality and emotion, and although his readings often clash with a listener's expectations, their logic ultimately prevails.

But Glenn Healy, the Rangers' 33-year-old veteran and oft-forgotten backup, was just as flawless at the other end. And after 65 minutes of entertaining, wide-open hockey -- and 37 shots on goal from each team -- the Rangers salvaged  a point in their last appearance at the storied Montreal Forum with a 2-2 tie.

Nochlin turned up for their meeting in a West Side apartment wearing red socks patterned with black Scotties. Mugler reacted with mock horror. The photographer taking their picture told him not to wrinkle his brow. \\"I'm supposed to be the aging intellectual,\\" Nochlin joked. They went on to talk about images of women, about femininity as an enterprise, about the uses of fashion, which Mugler calls \\"a trick and a game.\\" If fashion is in fact \\"a trick and a game,\\" what does the game tell us about the women who play it? MUGLER: So many things. A lot, I think. NOCHLIN: Well, that's if you think there's such a thing as women. I'm more inclined to agree with somebody like Joan Riviere, who was a student of Freud and said that femininity is a condition of disguise. I mean, there may be women, but femininity you dress up for. You learn how to be feminine -- it's not something natural, ever. So I would say that the great designer of clothing is always providing additional disguises to create new forms of the feminine. And I would say that clothes tell you something about the choice of the woman who's wearing them, but they don't tell you anything about the quote-unquote real woman, because I don't think there is a real woman. There's a real person, but I don't think it's a woman. MUGLER: Very true. There is only the person who chooses to play the feminine role, to experience different aspects of femininity. And do you feel, Thierry, that you're furnishing women with disguises that they can pick and choose and use? MUGLER: Completely. Completely. It's like directing your own everyday movie. Baudelaire said, \\"La femme est naturelle, c'est-a-dire abominable.\\" \\"Woman is natural -- that is, abominable.\\" Do you agree? MUGLER: No, because -- well, the body is beautiful. It's as simple as that. And for a fashion designer, it's the base. I mean, I think a pair of breasts is so gorgeous and I just can't resist when they're pushed up like this -- you know? It's so seductive. It's very sexual. NOCHLIN: How do you get them so round? MUGLER: Well, the minute you push them up and together, they go round. And then we pad them underneath and on the side, just to make them a little more perfect. NOCHLIN: I see. Linda, do you agree with Baudelaire? NOCHLIN: You know, Baudelaire's an old pal of mine, in a certain sense. And when he said that about women, he was being his usual perverse self. Understandably. He was so sick of everyone talking about Jean-Jacques Rousseau and \\"the natural\\" and how wonderful \\"the natural\\" was. So he took absolutely the opposite tack -- that nature was an abomination. Everything, then, is natural that is not manipulated, that is not changed by man. To him, a woman without makeup was disgusting. When she was natural, you could see all her -- her ooziness. MUGLER: Because the makeup was not as good as now! NOCHLIN: Well, he liked kohl around the eyes. Kohl, rouge -- of course it wasn't as good, and he was speaking mainly about prostitutes and courtesans. MUGLER: But at that time he was right, because all the bourgeois women, they were so boring. That's why the courtesans, they were so fabulous. NOCHLIN: They looked fabulous. MUGLER: They were free and beautiful. NOCHLIN: Right. And I think Baudelaire was speaking to a certain point. I mean, he also loved the dandy -- he didn't like natural men any more than natural women. So he was really talking as an urban man who wanted things to be infinitely civilized and yet, in a way, infinitely wild at the same time. He loved savages. He felt that savages who put on war paint and feathers and beads were as marvelous as women with makeup. When he talked about having to manipulate nature and change nature and alter nature and disguise nature, he didn't just mean civilization, he also meant what to him was the opposite of civilization. He meant primitive men and women who made themselves into wonderful fetish objects. And so -- I mean, as far as fashion is concerned -- I agree with him. I don't think there can be, quote unquote natural fashion. MUGLER: Exactly. We have to be frank. You know, nudity is great. The body is beautiful. But the minute that you put on clothes, this is an act of civilization. So I don't believe in natural fashion, either. Let's go for it! The corset. The push-up bra. Everything! If we do it, let's do the whole number. Linda, it sounds to me as if your theory is not so much that the woman is natural but that the person is natural and the woman artificial. MUGLER: Not only the woman but the whole mythology of femininity. NOCHLIN: Exactly. But I would also tie it in to certain postmodernist ideas about the self -- that there is no self, even. That the self is a condition of disguise and that we can move back and forth in terms of sexualities, in terms of social being, in terms of all kinds of senses of who we are. And I think fashion helps us wonderfully in this. That's why, in a sense, I would say that fashion is the postmodern art, because it helps to destabilize the self in such a wonderful way.   MUGLER: For me, it's different. I don't really agree about fashion. I don't like it when it gets carried away with itself, when anything is possible. We're seeing that a lot now, you know -- designers amusing themselves, fashion for its own sake.  Thierry, you've used drag queens and transsexuals as models for your shows. Does that mean that the image that your clothes project -- the pushed-up breasts, the cinched waist -- is in fact there for anyone to step into? That the requirements for looking like a woman aren't inherent to women? MUGLER: What I was saying in my choice of models is that this game of femininity, if you choose to play it -- well, why not a transsexual? Because they are the maximum. NOCHLIN: Beyond the maximum. MUGLER: No one wants to be more feminine than a transsexual.   So the game is open to everyone, not just women? MUGLER: Yes! Of course. And so is the other side of it -- being masculine. That's why I like very masculine women, as well. Thierry, when you see these women you've dressed on the runway being so forthright about their sexuality, who do you think is in control? Are they, or is it the men who respond to them? MUGLER: They are -- the women are in control. NOCHLIN: But they're also humorous about their sexuality. This is not a case of women humbling themselves before some mass-produced stereotype. These are women who appropriate their own sexuality, in a manner that's not exaggerated but -- MUGLER: Grandiose. NOCHLIN: Yes. Grandiose. MUGLER: And generous. NOCHLIN: Grandiosity and generosity, at the same time. That I find politically extremely interesting, because it shakes up our ideas of femininity altogether. It's so extreme -- MUGLER: Thank you! NOCHLIN: It's so extreme that these women aren't sex objects, they're sex subjects. Also, we know that this is a kind of artifice -- it's a performance. MUGLER: It's not artifice; it's a help -- a trick. Because what we're showing exists already; we didn't invent it. We're just presenting it in another way, in a better package. NOCHLIN: Right. But it's not a cute little secretary looking like this every day in the office so she'll get a raise. I mean, what you're doing is on a completely different scale. This is like some archetype.   MUGLER: And you put yourself in it sometimes, when you feel like it.   NOCHLIN: I think it all comes down to different roles. When you go to the office, you don't necessarily want to be seen as a sex object. Or if you're a doctor, you don't want your patients thinking of you in that way.   MUGLER: I would love to have a sex bomb as a doctor.   NOCHLIN: Well, maybe not as your surgeon.   MUGLER: As my surgeon, yes! I would go into the operation feeling more secure. Do you think there's any disparity between the way men want to see women and the way women want to be seen? MUGLER: Oh, enormous! I think men have a more abstract way of looking at women -- more abstract and more sexual. And women -- women want to be seen more as human beings. But you know, there's just as big a difference in the way men are seen. When women look at men, they always pick a man with a little bit of femininity showing. And men will like more a macho hero type. Look at the actors that men like: Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bruce Willis. And the women like Jeremy Irons. . . .  NOCHLIN: Mm-hm! MUGLER: You know? Women don't like big musclemen. Not so much. NOCHLIN: You're right, you're absolutely right. MUGLER: They like nice skin, blue eyes -- something a little wild. They like the lost type. Lost and wild, but thin. NOCHLIN: Depressed. MUGLER: And very often with long hair. NOCHLIN: I like them depressed. MUGLER: Depressed. So you see? There's no agreement on men, either. For centuries, Woman has been the subject of all kinds of painting and sculpture. And in our century, Woman has been the subject of fashion, as well. Men's fashions have remained fairly constant and low-key, by comparison, with none of the sumptuousness and fantasy that you find in men's clothing in the 18th century. What do you think accounts for this preoccupation with women? Is it something so simple as the fact that most artists and most fashion designers have been men, or is there some other explanation? MUGLER: I don't know why, but it's true that woman for centuries became a beautiful, stupid object. And now it's changing again. NOCHLIN: Well, you know, there's a theory, by a student of Freud's in the 1930's named Flugel. He had this theory, that at the end of the 18th century there was what he called \\"the Great Masculine Renunciation.\\" In the 18th century, men's clothes were even more splendid than women's -- I mean, absolutely gorgeous, in satin and silk. But with the coming of capitalism and the rise of the bourgeoisie, men adopted a kind of uniform: the black suit. And they renounced fashion, elegance and beauty. MUGLER: But the women did, too. And fashion passed to the courtesan. NOCHLIN: Yes. Right. O.K. So, in exchange for a certain kind of public power, an economic power, and in order to be able to run the capitalist factory, so to speak, man renounced beauty in order to become the subject --in order to control beauty. MUGLER: So, it was all about money. NOCHLIN: Yes. And I think gay culture has certainly brought back the idea that men can be spectacular and beautiful. And so did the dandy culture, in the 19th century. But that was more about nuances of cut, the right kind of cloth -- very subtle kinds of things. Whereas the task of being gorgeous was thrust onto women, who were less powerful -- women of leisure, that is, who had time to adorn themselves. MUGLER: It's also feminism that has changed the whole thing. I think now it's the turn of the man to be the sexual object. It's coming. NOCHLIN: To me, they always have been, the darlings. But I agree. You're absolutely right. I mean, look at that commercial, when all these secretaries rush to the window and watch this gorgeous workman take off his shirt and drink a Diet Coke. MUGLER: I love that. That's good. NOCHLIN: Now, you can't imagine that happening 20 years ago, even 10 years ago. You know, in the 17th and 18th centuries, it was men's bodies that were the role models. When you passed the test at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts for the Prix de Rome, for example, you did something called an academie, which was a study of the male nude, not the female nude -- they didn't even let women in to model.  Often they would use male bodies -- male models -- and just add breasts. And then you think of Winkelmann in the 19th century, who said that the really beautiful body was the male body. So, I mean, the so-called ideal body type has varied so much historically, and in many cases the women were masculine. Thierry, as someone who's designing not only clothes but images of women, how much responsibility -- if any -- do you feel toward women and the way they would like to be seen? MUGLER: Well, when I work, it's on a very concrete level. I do the fittings, and I think what women will like, and what they won't. And very often I change something from the way I've drawn it because it turns out to be too high or too stiff, too this or too that. But besides that, I don't think about responsibility -- I'm not taking it so seriously. NOCHLIN: I'm always amazed when I hear women talking about being \\"forced\\" to wear something. I mean, they don't have to take it if they don't want it. I never feel forced to wear anything. I adore clothes, but I am the least fashionable person in the world. I don't have that kind of body; I'm 63. But of course, I'm speaking from a point of great privilege. I'm a sort of successful person in my field, and because I'm in the arts, I can look any way I want. I can go to a formal dinner party in a muumuu and it doesn't matter. But I can't imagine not being interested in clothing. I guess if you're an intellectual woman, you're not supposed to talk about how much pleasure you get out of clothing. But I have to admit, as an art critic and historian, there are times when I get much more pleasure out of looking at clothes and touching clothes than I do out of looking at some of the ridiculous art that I'm forced to confront. I mean, I find fashion an art form, and what I love about it is that it's an art form that can be part of your body. MUGLER: It's the only art that walks down the street. NOCHLIN: And the body is the central focus. Not only does an outfit shape your body but it also makes you move a certain way -- it choreographs you. MUGLER: For me, the real elegance is when you sense somebody happy in their body, and in their clothes. Even when the clothes are constraining -- like a corset or a bustier. The notion that there can be pleasure in wearing something constraining goes against so much of what fashion these days purports to be about -- comfort and freedom of movement. MUGLER: But it depends on the context. I mean, if you're going for a walk in the forest, you don't want to wear a corset. But this idea that fashion should be comfortable, it's very conformiste. Fashion is nothing; fashion doesn't exist. Who cares about trends and all that stuff? The only thing that matters is these little tricks that are at our disposal, to help us have more fun or a better life.   I won't ask you to define good taste, but I wonder what you think is its antithesis? Vulgarity? MUGLER: Oh, no! Vulgarity's fun! I would say that the opposite of good taste is bourgeois chic, a kind of obligation to conform. NOCHLIN: Everyone wearing the same thing. MUGLER: If someone now goes to the Oscars wearing a tiara and a fabulous dress, people say, \\"Oh, she's so tacky,\\" because you have to wear a chemise de nuit and no jewel now to be in. You have to look discreet and poor and beige and gray. NOCHLIN: Right. Understated. Safe taste is, to me, bad taste. MUGLER: That's it. The opposite of good taste is safe.

A handful of commodity prices are inching up, but there is no evidence that self-sustaining inflation driven by wages is in the works. The President is a Democrat, but on the critical issues of taxation, spending and regulation he is acting more like a deficit-fearing pre-Reagan conservative.   Why, then, have the bond markets reacted so perversely to what the Federal Reserve labeled a long range pre-emptive strike against inflation? And why have the big central banks had to intervene repeatedly to stabilize the dollar against the mark and yen, just when the interest-rate advantage to holding assets in dollars is rising?   Some would point to President Clinton's flat-footed policies toward Japan and China, which have unsettled major trade relationships. And some fear that the Democrats will revert to free-spending form, once they come to their liberal senses. But a more plausible explanation for the markets' jumpiness is offered by James Tobin, the Nobel laureate in economics who advised President John F. Kennedy. \\"The markets are fighting the last war,\\" he argues, behaving as if the inflation of 1979 is just around the corner.

A friend of mine visiting from L.A. says Heidi is interviewed on the news there all the time and looks tired and run-down. She's so thin. I'm sure Dr. Fleiss has given her excellent nutritional tips. But since when has a child paid attention to a parent's advice? Heidi, Heidi, listen to your father. Tuesday.  The Wall Street Journal warns that many Americans overuse over-the-counter drugs. I've only read about Heidi using prescription medication like Percodan and Quaaludes. Still, I'm concerned. The Journal also mentions that 36 percent of 18-to-34-year-olds plan to purchase a recreational vehicle. I hope that Heidi is one of them. She needs a break. What if Heidi's trial is on Court TV? That's quite an ordeal. Just watching Leslie Abramson from 3,000 miles away during the Menendez trial was exhausting. Heidi should take some time off in a Winnebago now. Instead, she's promoting a new line of sleepwear. Admirable, yes. Idle hands are the devil's playground. But she's obviously working too hard. I myself have just joined a gym and think Heidi should too. And if I could get her to join Equinox, I'd get a free month. Wednesday A.M.  Heidi refers to her arrest for drugs and pandering as The Troubles. She is obviously a serious person. I hope she received her invitation to the Tikkun Conference of Liberal and Progressive Jews. Tikkun is \\"disappointed with the degree to which the Clinton Administration has been able to follow through on its commitment to a politics of meaning.\\" Heidi probably is too. I hope Heidi can attend the Tikkun conference. There's a workshop called \\"Twenty-somethings: Finding Our Voice.\\" P.M.  Equinox has the best shampoo. Sometimes I go just to wash my hair. I read in Vanity Fair that Heidi's $1.6 million house has the feel of a sorority. So does Equinox! All those naked women gossiping in the locker room. Today, eavesdropping, I learned that if you're allergic to it, you can return all your makeup to a department store. Thursday.  There was an article in the paper about rotary phones. I have a rotary phone in my bedroom and am often vilified as a Luddite for it. But now many neighborhoods are requesting that their push-button phones be replaced by old-fashioned rotary phones in order to prevent drug dealers from beeping their couriers from corner Touch-Tone phones. I have never had a drug dealer beep a courier from my bedroom phone, and now I know why. If Heidi does join my gym and I get a chance to chat with her in the locker room in a sorority-like fashion, I will strongly recommend she change her telephones to rotary instruments. The Vanity Fair article mentioned some exchange of small packets -- I hope they were not over-the-counter remedies -- that could easily have been prevented by this simple change. Friday A.M.  I really miss Leslie Abramson. To take my mind off her, I drive with a friend to Montauk in an ice storm for the annual winter weekend beach walk of the American Littoral Society. Trying to be brave myself, I think of Heidi, how brave she's been. And loyal. \\"I can't get mad at them,\\" she says of the young women who have been arrested and agreed to testify against her. \\"I won't turn on them. Not those girls. . . . I just know them. . . . I know them.\\" P.M.  We arrive early and after dinner hear a lecture by Mickey Cohen, for whom I would travel six hours in a snowstorm any day. Mickey is a naturalist and a brilliant teacher. He told us all about Yankee Whaling. I do not have a strong predisposition for lectures on Yankee Whaling, but Mickey can talk about fungus (and often does) and make its life cycle sound like a wonderful 19th-century novel. If only Heidi had come. The Vanity Fair article about her says a lot of her friends have deserted her. So she needs some ways to fill her evenings. Will she have to go to jail? Maybe it will be a growth experience and she'll study law there, or Yankee Whaling, or help incarcerated mothers, the way Jean Harris did, while Charlie Sheen and Robert Evans just keep going to shallow Hollywood parties and exposing themselves to secondhand cigarette smoke. Who says prostitution laws are unjust? Saturday.  Walked on the beach. Mickey pointed out garnets and red seaweed, which is used to make agar, a sponge, star coral and a long spiny thing with a row of little packets that he said was a case for whelk eggs. Each little packet contains lots of tiny whelks. One of them sticks its stomach out of its shell and eats up its siblings. All the empty little shells are left behind. Maybe Vanity Fair should do a piece on whelks. Maybe Heidi should call Elizabeth Taylor. Liz is also loyal. Maybe she'd join the gym. Sunday.  So cold the tide pools were frozen. Rocks covered with an icy glaze. Saw one harbor seal, a gannet, some mergansers. Decided not to worry about Heidi anymore. She wouldn't like it. No culture of victimization for her! It was Heidi herself who said, \\"Every man was taken advantage of\\" about those who paid $3,000 for sex, and I think she may have a point. Drove home into the sun, tired but eager for the Tikkun Conference next weekend. \\"Recent attempts to construe women as sexually passive and in need of much public protection,\\" the flier says, \\"and detailed guidelines for men about acceptable sexual behavior has stimulated an important debate about the relationship between private life and public concerns.\\" Heidi, you have already contributed so many important insights to this debate.

Such thoughts came to mind Friday night at the Brooklyn Academy of Music's Opera House, at the first of three concerts over the weekend of a new-music program presented by the academy and the Brooklyn Philharmonic as part of the Next Wave Festival.

It is a silly story of the unimaginative type, done in a very crude way, and if one of the enemies of motion pictures ever saw it, he would pooh-pooh the idea of any improvement in films in the last ten years.The narrative is one of the pigeonhole affairs: Poor girl marries rich young waster, who has an occasional thirst","excerpt":"thinks of her former sweetheart, but returns to wealthy husband, knowing she would have been bored to extinction with the farmer.Mary (Ann Forrest) works in a shop. The wealthy Harry Ryan meets her and instanter falls madly in love. Mary decides that she will go home as usual with the man who waits for her in the snow and slush—\\"parked at the subway station,\\" as the title writer puts it. Ryan is indomitable and forthwith pursues Mary to her home, where there is the father in his shirt sleeves, the ugly little brothers, a nice little sister and a severe mother. Not even the sight of the family cools Harry's affection. They all peer through the door when Harry holds Mary's hand.So you have a sequence of Mary doping out matters, finally deciding that it is better to be wealthy and worried than poor and suffer from ennui. She therefore becomes Mrs. Ryan, hardly suspecting that Harry would be up to his old tricks of drinking immediately after their marriage.Harry has a bar in his own home, of which he is quite proud. The tall, skinny friend and the plethoric person are always accommodating in helping Harry to reduce the alcoholic stock. Harry has his initial dispute and, after a stormy night, he tries to make amends by sending up by the major domo one flower. Incidentally one grasps afterward the reason for such a small peace offering. The young man knows he may err again, and the next time he must send up more flowers, and then again a whole bunch. He believes in starting in a small way.There is a statue in the home said to be symbolic of \\"goodness, purity and virtue.\\" The villain sees the fair Mrs. Ryan in a faint, having herself tried to imbibe a little, and he bends over and melodramatically places a kiss upon her well-posed lips. There are ructions following this, as Mr. Nigh, the director of this production, arranged to have the semi-hero unsteadily watching from a doorway. Eventually Mary shoots the villain.Then she wakes up. It was all a dream, and she had been reading a book called \\"Marriage Morals\\" before she went to sleep. It should also be stated that during her dream, when very miserable, she decided to go and see how her former sweetheart was getting along and find out what she had missed. He is doing well, having \\"forty acres, six cows, a wife and two children,\\" as he expresses it. Following a good deal of chatter about the farm. Mary finds she can't stand any more after he says with wearisome pleasure that he hopes to make enough money next year to put a concrete floor in the barn.Moore does very well with his witless part, and Miss Forrest is pretty in an unexpressive way. Moore hasn't got much to do, for which he may have been thankful. One felt rather sorry when the villain was shot, and relieved when it was only a dream. He might have done something with this production if they'd given him a chance. The last we saw of him was when know-it-all Mary—after her dream—pushes the villain out of the taxi. Comedies, music and so forth relieve the tedium of this blighted effort.
