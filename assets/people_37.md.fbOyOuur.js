At the same time that you are being asked to decide who should spend the next four years in City Hall, you will get to weigh in on whether eight years in office is enough for anyone. If it is approved, ballot proposal No. 4 would force candidates who win on Tuesday and are re-elected in four years to be out by 2001.

Besides, the rather whimsical experiment of grafting Dr. Freud's facile theory of dream symbols on a typical Columbia melodrama has justified itself admirably in the case of \\"Blind Alley,\\" at the Globe, by producing, on the whole, a rather better-than-typical Columbia melodrama. Henceforward, there is no reason why psychoanalysis should be ashamed of Chester Morris, or even why Chester should be ashamed of psychoanalysis.The story is that a gang of killers led by a super-killer who always has the same bad dream every night (Chester) suddenly bursts in on the lakeside retreat of Dr. Ralph Bellamy, the eminent psychologue, and takes it over while waiting for a boat in which to make their getaway.

Eventually the Indians disappeared and later the brokers and lawyers arrived, occupying mountainous skyscrapers and clogging 17th-century streets with 20th-century traffic.   Now, a new wrinkle appears: a proposal for an auto race that would roar through those well-worn streets and spin around the biggest skyscraper in the city, the World Trade Center. Is this progress?    \\"This is not the first place one would think of staging an auto race,\\" said Matthew Scheckner, the executive director of the New York City Sports Commission, leaning back in his chair. \\"But no one has said no yet.\\"    In fact, it is too early in the process for anyone to say yes, either.    But the sports commission, a partnership between the city and the business community, is lobbying city agencies to approve an auto race, tentatively called the New York 200, that would rumble through the Financial District as early as next July.  180 Miles an Hour     The Port Authority, the Department of Transportation and the Fire Department, among other agencies, are mulling over a preliminary proposal and contemplating issues of safety, logistics and cost. The ultimate decision would lie with Mayor David N. Dinkins, said Barbara Fife, the Deputy Mayor for Planning and Development.   \\"They have made a presentation and we asked for a good bit of follow-up information,\\" Ms. Fife said. \\"It is under initial review.\\"   Mr. Scheckner, the race's biggest cheerleader, conceded that the idea of sending race cars hurtling around the World Trade Center at speeds of 180 miles an hour might at first sound absurd.   But then he asked a visitor to imagine the possibilities. An auto race in the shadow of Manhattan's tallest buildings would become an instant classic, automatically in a league with the Indianapolis 500, the pinnacle of auto racing, he said. Not only would the city's image benefit from positive television coverage, but hotels, restaurants and tourist attractions would make an extra $36 million during race weekend.     There are, of course, catches. Lower Manhattan would be shut down for an entire weekend. And automobile, pedestrian and business traffic would be disrupted for weeks in advance, as crews prepared the area for the onslaught of 27 Indy cars, those classic, low-slung vehicles with the fat, uncovered tires.    Streets would have to be repaved, temporary concrete barriers installed. Mr. Scheckner said it was too early in the process to estimate how much the preparations would cost the city, but he said he was confident the city would be a financial winner by the time the checkered flag was waved.    Similar races have been run through the streets of other cities, including Denver, Detroit and, most famous of all, Monte Carlo.    The 1.3-mile course that the sports commission and the race promoter, Motormarketing International, have mapped out seems plausible, bypassing lower Manhattan's more convoluted streets, like Wall Street, in favor of wider passages, like Church and West Streets.   The race would begin near the corner of Church and Liberty Streets, proceed north on Church, then west on Vesey Street, then north on West Street","excerpt":"after an ambitious hairpin turn at Chambers Street, it would continue south on West Street and then east on Liberty. Some Tight Turns     The biggest leaps of the imagination are required at several snug corners along the course. \\"Right here would be a turn?\\" said Jim Miller, a 48-year-old supervisor at First Boston, when informed that the corner where he was standing on a recent afternoon, at the intersection of Church and Vesey Streets, could be part of an automobile race course. \\"I don't see how they could do that one. It's kind of tight.\\"   Lou Guarino, 53, a postal worker, was equally skeptical. \\"It's an absurd place to have it and you'll inconvenience a lot of people, even on a weekend,\\" he said. \\"You got enough inconveniences in the city without having that.\\"   Still, other pedestrians along the route, and several lower Manhattan community representatives, said they were familiar with the plan and eagerly anticipating the race.   \\"A couple of days of inconvenience -- and there is going to be inconvenience -- is probably worth it when you consider the year-round benefits for our citizens,\\" said Paul Goldstein, district manager of Community Board No. 1 in lower Manhattan.   Mr. Goldstein said the race promoter has promised to donate $350,000 to the board for community service projects if the race takes place. \\"I'm sure the sponsors are making money, so why shouldn't the community?\\" he said.     Barbara L. Christian, the president of the Downtown-Lower Manhattan Association, a private organization which represents the major corporations in the area, said the disruptions of the race would be far outweighed by the boost it would provide to sagging spirits in the financial community. \\"It has to draw attention in a positive way to the lower Manhattan area,\\" she said.   The race, which would succeed the Marlboro Grand Prix held in recent years at the Meadowlands in New Jersey, is the first to be proposed for Manhattan, but not for New York City.    In the mid-1980's, a different group made a bid to stage a Grand Prix race, using Formula One cars, in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park in Queens. The proposal was derailed by environmental concerns and a broader scandal centered on the financial conduct of one of its main supporters, the late Donald R. Manes, who was then Borough President. Mr. Scheckner emphasized that the sports commission and the current race promoter played no role in the Queens proposal.    One professional driver who is eager to enter the race is Danny Sullivan, who drove a taxicab for six weeks here in 1969, but who is better known for his victory in the Indianapolis 500 in 1985.

The international superstars of Irish popular culture, from rock icons like U2 and Sinead O'Connor to the film directors Neil Jordan and Jim Sheridan to actors like Stephen Rea and Liam Neeson, are sources of endless fascination, pride and at times heated debate at home. Who could have imagined that a playwright with a 30-year-long career, let alone one as quiet as Mr. Friel, would get the same star treatment?   The reason is \\"Lughnasa,\\" which has been seen and applauded nearly everywhere, from Broadway to New Delhi, since its premiere at the Abbey Theater in 1990. \\"Lughnasa\\" was little different in form (Chekhovian) or setting (the mythical town of Ballybeg, County Donegal) from other fine Friel plays, like \\"Aristocrats,\\" \\"Translations\\" and even \\"Philadelphia, Here I Come!,\\" the work that put him on the international theatrical map (and Broadway) in the mid-1960's. Yet the \\"Lughnasa\\" characters, poor, unhappy sisters of 1936 with an undying thirst for spiritual ecstasy, touched a mass audience as no Friel creations had before.

But, during most of the composer's life, it was fashionable within certain musical circles to dismiss him as a sentimental reactionary who could never come to terms with the latest Modernist innovations, and should therefore suffer the consequences. Barber's insistence on a tonal framework for the majority of his compositions; his refusal to treat composition as historical process; his commitment to direct, lyrical, unabashedly emotional musical     statements were all in opposition to the temper of the times, and consequently his work was often derided as commercial adventurism and worse. But through it all, Barber kept working, gathering two Pulitzer Prizes along the way.

In ARTHUR RACKHAM: A Biography (Arcade/Little, Brown, $40","excerpt":"after Dec. 31, $45), the art historian James Hamilton suggests that the Stamford House garden, across the street from Rackham's childhood home, might have been the source of his fantastic arborial people and anthropomorphic trees. Unfortunately the biography, though conscientious and affectionate, gives more insight into Rackham's finances than his imagination. Partly this is due to Mr. Hamilton's effort to correct the view of Rackham as \\"some kind of busy little gnome, acquainted with the fairies.\\" Born in London in 1867, Rackham supported himself first as a clerk in an insurance office, then as a magazine illustrator. He married a portrait painter and had one daughter.

With 1,312 pages, each 10 by 14 inches of heavy archival paper, in its gilt-stamped slipcase, this Bible weighs 15.5 pounds, as heavy as stone tablets from Mount Sinai perhaps. What gives it real distinction, however, is its art: 263 paintings and 407 artistic ornaments from Renaissance masters -- principally the Ghirlandaio-painted pages in the Vatican Library's 15th-century Urbino Bible -- lavishly printed in six colors and outlined with a specially concocted gold ink that does indeed gleam on the page. The text is the New Revised Standard Version, the one that banishes all the male pronouns it can and otherwise tries to take offense out of the archaic book's archaic language. But it is still pungent. If you turn to the Gospel of St. Luke, on page 1,069 you will find Jesus in a synagogue reading from the prophet Isaiah: \\"The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to bring good news to the poor.\\" And although this edition's apparatus lacks the cross-referencing common to most cheap modern versions, if you riffle through Isaiah you will find the original at page 587, referring to the poor as \\"the oppressed.\\" Of course, this magnificent production does not seem intended to let the poor know about their good news. It comes with a quire of blank genealogical charts for families to immortalize themselves in for generations, and a big presentation medallion at the very front, in case someone wants to make a lavish gift and insure that the giver's name will be the first thing a reader will see.

Ms. Rimland, a 45-year-old matrimonial lawyer, took her own life and that of her daughter around midnight on June 15 by running the car engine inside her garage after looping a rubber hose from the tailpipe into the car window. In a note she left behind she said she could no longer abide her husband's sexual abuse of her daughter, even though a court had found no substance to that charge.  Groping for Answers    Ms. Rimland's awful act has left those who knew her groping for an explanation. Her husband's friends paint her as an unstable, ruthless woman who would stop at nothing to keep him from their daughter.  But her many champions describe her as a loving mother who despaired of any other means of protecting her child.    The mother was buried by a Reform rabbi under a searing sun in a cemetery in Elmont, L.I. Her two children from an earlier marriage, Jason Rimland, 23, and Marisa Rimland, 19, leaned against each other sobbing inconsolably. An outpouring of mourners proclaimed her death another injustice of a family court system that had permitted the father, Arie Adler, to resume unsupervised visits.    Abigail, a bubbly girl who loved to sing and dance to Disney songs, was laid to rest after sundown in a small cemetery in Monsey, N.Y., that belongs to the largely Hasidic community to which her father had begun to cleave. Car headlights had to illuminate the grave so that mourners could aim their fistfuls of dirt. Jason and Marisa were there, even though Mr. Adler had won the battle to bury Abigail in a cemetery of his choosing.   The separate funerals were the culmination of a two-year custody fight that has not died even with Abigail's death. It shows how fierce and irrational battles over children can get, and how difficult it is for Family Courts to sort out the truth.   The case has galvanized several groups that feel Family Court judges are biased against women, insensitive to sexual abuse and overly secretive and insular. However, the father's defenders see it as another example of a national hysteria over child abuse that has led to fabrication of destructive charges in a blind fury over other grievances.    But overriding any ideological issues were the consuming passions of the parents, whose bitterness lives on in their survivors. Jason and Marisa originally wanted their mother and half sister cremated, but the Orthodox community, which opposes cremation, sent a Hatzolah ambulance worker to the coroner's officer to safeguard Abigail's body. Jason and Marisa have already cleaned out Abigail's toys and dolls from her room in a large ranch house here to keep them from the father.   \\"The family doesn't let the living live in peace and it doesn't let the dead die in peace,\\" said Anne Selinger, who put Mr. Adler up in her family's home. Extreme Visions    The story of Abigail's parents, like that of many custody fights, is woven of extreme visions. Her family and supporters see Marcia Rimland as a strong, devoted mother who snuffed out her daughter's life when she felt she had no other way to protect her. As a lawyer, Marisa said, her mother knew that appealing the Family Court decision could take a year, during which visits she considered inadequately supervised would continue.   \\"She would rather Abigail not be there than to have Abigail hurt,\\" Marisa said. \\"She loved her more than life.\\"   \\"She felt cornered,\\" said her sister-in-law, Deanna Rimland. \\"She felt she had no more options.\\"    But Mrs. Selinger and leaders of the Orthodox community around Monsey see her as an unstable, calculating and litigious woman who was so obsessed with excluding her husband that she was willing to brainwash Abigail into believing she was being molested.    According to Mrs. Selinger, Ms. Rimland had always kept her children apart from her estranged husbands. For many years, Mrs. Selinger said, Ms. Rimland had influenced Marisa and Jason to shun their father, Leonard Cohen, who died in January. Similarly, Ms. Selinger said, she made sure Arie Adler would never see Abigail.   \\"She couldn't do it through the court system so she did it by taking her life and her daughter's life,\\" Mrs. Selinger said.    Views of the 38-year-old Mr. Adler are similarly stark. Mrs. Selinger sees only an affectionate father who tried to protect a daughter who cherished him against a ruthless wife. But the Rimland supporters condemn him as a cold, selfish man who inspired tantrums of fear in his helpless daughter and took advantage of her.   Mr. Adler's lawyer, Howard M. Gurock, denies that his client ever abused Abigail and accuses the mothert of brainwashing the child into making the charges.    The final act was played out swiftly. On June 14, Judge William P. Warren of Family Court in Rockland ruled that the preponderance of evidence did not indicate that Mr. Adler had abused his daughter. A court-appointed social worker had testified that Abigail's \\"presentation is entirely consistent with that of a sexually abused child.\\" But other witnesses found significant inconsistencies, and Mr. Adler's Lubavitcher hosts, Mrs. Selinger and her husband, Craig, said they had seen only a warm relationship whenever father and daughter stayed over.   The judge, concluding that the tales of abuse were the result of prompting by the mother, ordered a resumption of unsupervised visits in two days. Desperate, Ms. Adler drove to the Appellate Division in Brooklyn on Tuesday and won what some felt was a concession. The Selingers would supervise the visits. But Ms. Rimland felt that the Selingers were too close to her estranged husband.   That night she wrote a note to her older children on a piece of memo paper and led her daughter to her red Toyota.   \\"You are my children and I love you more than myself,\\" said the note that Jason found in the car. \\"Abigail is also my child. I cannot knowingly allow her to be sexually abused. I have no choice. I hope you understand. Be kind to each other. I'm sorry I have to leave you alone. Love forever. Mom.\\" Met Six Years Ago    Marcia and Arie met at a party six years ago. He was a broad-shouldered Israeli immigrant with gold-rimmed glasses who was studying electrical engineering. She was a small, slender woman with intense eyes who had been raised as a furrier's daughter in the Bronx. She had two teen-age children from an unhappy first marriage and was fashioning a career as a lawyer.   They married in September 1988, but quarreled regularly, particularly with the arrival of Abigail on June 3, 1989. Their disputes turned so violent that the police were called more than half a dozen times. By August 1991, Mr. Adler moved out, eventually living as a boarder in Hasidic homes, and Ms. Rimland sued for divorce.   One issue dividing them was Abigail's religious upbringing. Ms. Rimland disregarded most Jewish observance, but Mr. Adler, who once had been willing to work on Yom Kippur, began following the Orthodox path of colleagues at International Business Machines who gave him rides to work, though he did not adhere to any particular sect.    He wanted his daughter, who called him Abba, the Hebrew word for father, to eat kosher food and he forbade any phone calls on the Sabbath.   \\"He fills her head with Chasidic dogma,\\" Ms. Rimland wrote in one of several briefs she filed as her own lawyer. Sole Custody to the Mother    Judge Warren awarded Ms. Rimland sole custody in April 1992. He did not give credence to Ms. Rimland's warnings that Mr. Adler was planning to abduct Abigail to Israel and he permitted Abigail to stay with Mr. Adler every other weekend. Mr. Adler never fled to Israel, but he did fail to make support payments and was jailed for 31 days last year.    Mrs. Selinger blamed his incarceration on Ms. Rimland's excessive demands for money, which, she said, had impoverished Mr. Adler.   In September 1992, Ms. Rimland filed a brief that described what she charged was a pattern of sexual abuse. She said she began to notice that her daughter became hysterical whenever she was dropped off for an overnight visit.    \\"She would scream and hold on to me so tight that I literally would have to pry her arms and legs from me,\\" Mr. Rimland wrote, adding that she always encouraged Abigail to go with her father.   She said she also noticed that her daughter's toilet training began to regress and that she often masturbated. Ms. Rimland called this to the attention of officials at the county's Child Protection Services, who wondered whether Abigail was being abused.    That was the first time she suspected that possibility, Ms. Rimland said. So she asked Abigail what her father wore when she slept over. She said Abigail told her he wore nothing but an undershirt and repeatedly touched her genital area.   About the same time last summer, Cherri Varvaro, who ran a home day care center that Abigail attended, took a workshop on abused children and decided that Abigail exhibited the classic behaviors of abuse. She asked Abigail and was told that her father sometimes \\"tickled\\" her genitals.    Ms. Varvaro alerted Ms. Rimland and Child Protection Services in August. Their complaints led to an investigation by the County Attorney.  During the nine months until his decision, the judge insisted that Abigail's visits with Mr. Adler be supervised.   The judge appointed Dr. Virginia C. Strand, a clinical social worker, to interview Abigail and decide whether abuse had occurred. Dr. Strand reported in November that Abigail \\"demonstrated a hypervigilant attitude commonly seen in abused children and/or children who witness domestic violence.\\" She said Abigail, with no coaxing, volunteered that her father had penetrated her with his fingers and penis.   But Judge Warren, who has been on the bench five years, said in an interview that he discounted much of Dr. Strand's report because \\"Strand never considered the possibility of prompting by the mother.\\" Indeed, he said, one of several social workers monitoring the case had asked Abigail whether anyone had told her to say such things about her father and Abigail had replied, \\"Mommy told me to say this.\\"    \\"I did not find the mother credible,\\" Judge Warren said.    More convincing to Judge Warren was Mrs. Selinger, the mother of four young daughters and a son, who testified in hearings in February and March that Abigail and Mr. Adler slept in separate beds in a basement playroom and that she saw only affectionate relations. It was the mother whom Abigail did not want to see, Mrs. Selinger testified, describing how Abigail became hysterical when Ms. Rimland phoned.   \\"Do you think I as a mother with small children would allow something like this to happen in my house?\\" Mrs. Selinger said of the abuse charges.    By the time of the hearings, the custody cases had so consumed Ms. Rimland and Mr. Adler that both lost their jobs.

While fruitful critical and biographical connections can be drawn between the stories and Yourcenar's formidable oeuvre -- particularly \\"Memoirs of Hadrian,\\" \\"Alexis\\" and \\"Oriental Tales\\" -- the stories also stand on their own.  As translated by Mr. Manguel, the prose of the young Yourcenar is accomplished and her vision arrestingly mature. In the first story, \\"A Blue Tale,\\" European merchants set out to plunder a cave full of sapphires on a Middle Eastern island only to meet failure, death and destitution. The spare recitation and repeated use of the color blue prove to be haunting features in this fable of greed, in which a woman catches sapphires in her hair for the merchants","excerpt":"after she is cruelly kidnapped, her tears turn to aquamarines. In \\"The First Evening,\\" initially written by Yourcenar's father and revised by her at his request, a jaded, self-absorbed man travels with his young wife to their honeymoon in Switzerland. His fear of life's banality, which engulfs him as he approaches his conjugal bed, is momentarily abated by a telegram announcing the death of his former mistress, who still preoccupies him. The last story, \\"An Evil Spell,\\" further reveals Yourcenar's imaginative powers as she describes a witch hunt, set somewhere near the Mediterranean in southern France. Here a woman named Algenare is deemed to have cast an evil spell on a woman she envies. Pointing up the human need for scapegoats, Yourcenar illustrates how naming and becoming are one, as the villagers brand Algenare a witch and Algenare herself finds in the night sky \\"in large trembling strokes, the giant letters of the witches' alphabet.\\" For its insight into human frailty and vice, for its language forged  with precision and nuance, this slim trio of tales is richly rewarding.

But the true glory of New York's night life is live music. Musicians flock to prove themselves in front of famously discerning (or skeptical) audiences and influential media gatekeepers. In New York, a local legend can leap to national prominence or be dismissed with a yawn. World-class, name-brand musicians can also be heard all over town, every night of the year. (One measure of the abundance is that big bands, once declared dead, appear regularly at half a dozen clubs.) To be heard in New York, musicians perform in surprisingly small spaces as well as intimidatingly large ones, in plush rooms with a view and in concrete bunkers.    The vagaries of Manhattan real estate can make live music an expensive proposition or a crowded one, and while clubs in other cities often double as hangouts, many New York clubs brusquely disperse the customers within minutes after the music ends. (They're trying to keep peace with the neighbors.) But you can hear nearly every kind of music, from Irish traditional songs to the latest post-grunge mutation.    What follows is a visitor's guide to a dozen quintessential New York night spots -- institutions and neighborhood joints, elite watering holes and beer-soaked dives. It's easy to make a long night of it in Manhattan -- an early set at the Bottom Line, perhaps, followed by a late one at the Mercury Lounge and then at CBGB, or an early jazz set at the Knitting Factory and a late one at the Village Vanguard. Dance halls like the Latin Quarter and the Tunnel come alive after midnight, so it would be easy to squeeze in an earlier show at S.O.B.'s. They are glimpses of the myriad cities within the city, of ephemeral communities that are conjured for the length of a set or an evening, then dissolve into the night.   The Bottom Line, on West Fourth Street, the old reliable of New York rock clubs, has a simple mission: to present rock, pop and occasionally jazz before a comfortably seated audience. Almost aggressively nondescript, it serves a menu of burgers, pizza and fries. The Bottom Line started out as a music-business showcase club, and there are still nights when most of the seats have been bought for executives, radio programmers and journalists; look for visiting performers in the ring of tables next to the aisle. But on most nights, ordinary music fans from their 20's to their 40's -- people who don't slam-dance -- settle in to appreciate old favorites or promising newcomers. Even when seats have been sold out, there's a chance to cram into the bar area, where admission is sold only on the day of the show. Recently the club instituted a no-smoking policy.    The dump as institution: punk-rock was born at CBGB and OMFUG (which initially stood for Country, Bluegrass, Blues and Other Music for Uplifting Gourmandisers), and in more than 20 years, little has changed beyond the depth of the soot at the stucco-fronted dive on the Bowery at Bleeker Street. It still has its uneven floor, its line of neon beer signs over the bar, its low admission prices and its policy of booking rock bands that play their own material -- five and six a night, mostly loud, often worthwhile. The crowds now include foreign visitors and record-company talent scouts as well as buzz-cut youth, N.Y.U. students and people who learned about punk-rock on MTV, all providing continued amusement to the Bowery's street dwellers. Inside, fans shoulder their way to the front to be blasted by one of the loudest, clearest sound systems among New York rock clubs. And those who visit the bathrooms will find a graffiti history of the rock underground.    No one believed that the rock and jazz avant-garde could regularly pay the bills when Michael Dorf opened the first Knitting Factory on the edge of Little Italy. Last year he moved to a bigger space, at 74 Leonard Street in TriBeCa. There he presents better-known jazz and rock acts in a large, two-story room and lesser-known improvisers, performance artists, poets and indescribables downstairs in the AlterKnit room, as well as free late-night jam sessions. Students and other bohemian types populate the new Knitting Factory, eagerly comparing notes on artistic obscurities. The place is small enough so that jazz groups can perform unamplified -- a rare setup indeed -- but large enough to book bands on the alternative-rock circuit. There are bars upstairs and down serving microbrewery beer.    The first thing that greets the well-dressed patrons at the Latin Quarter, on Broadway at 96th Street, is a metal detector; even ladies' handbags are searched for weapons. But upstairs, in the fully renovated space of the former Club Broadway, is an elegant slice of Miami or an updated Havana: a permanent prom in a room of subdued grays and pinks, with etched-glass medallions of the club's logo and mirrored disco balls on the ceiling. In a crowd whose ages range from the 20's to the 70's, women of all shapes wear skin-tight dresses; men arrive in jackets or stylish casual wear (but no T-shirts or sneakers), and everybody comes to dance: rhumbas, guarachas, cha-chas and merengues played by some of the best-known performers on the salsa circuit. The well-heeled sit at tables, where a couple or a group share a seriously marked-up bottle of liquor (at $70 to $90); by the bar, single people eye one another, shy until they pair off and stroll onto the dance floor; then the sensual rhythms take over.    The Mercury Lounge on East Houston Street, a relative newcomer among Manhattan clubs, is an unostentatious, brick-walled box with a superb sound system and a mixture of local performers and up-and-coming bands on tour: songwriters, country bands, pop-rock groups, alternative rockers. For some reason, the place seems to invite conversation between sets; maybe it's a result of squeezing past the long bar to get to the music room's few seats. But even when the room is crowded, it stays relaxed.     AT the top of Rockefeller Center, that Art Deco monument, are two clubs that feel like colorized versions of 1930's movies, where staff people stroll by in pillbox-hatted uniforms straight out of Fred Astaire's heyday.    The express elevator ride up 65 stories makes ears pop, and eyes pop when they see the view. The panorama is shared by the Promenade bar and two swank supper clubs, where jackets are required, dinner for two runs upward of $100 and photographers work the tables, offering romantic couples a chance to preserve the moment.    One club is the Rainbow and Stars, which has shiny silver stars on the walls and stars and rhinestones strewn on the tables. Waiters glide discreetly past banquettes and tables nestled close to the stage; the club's dropped ceiling increases a sense of cozy intimacy, and a $40 cover charge ($20 for late weekday sets) brings a graying, affluent audience. Behind the performer, usually a cabaret singer, the windows reflect rainbow-colored lights in the walls, above a view of city lights radiating for miles. When Vic Damone wanted to sing about moonlight not long ago, he could turn around and search the sky for the Moon.    The Rainbow Room, by contrast, offers grandeur: windows two stories high and a big circular dance floor below a curlicued chandelier, with tiers of tables facing an old-fashioned bandstand. From 7:30 P.M. to 1 A.M. there is nonstop music. The Rainbow Room Orchestra plays big-band and Latin tunes, featuring a singer in a satin gown; between its sets, small groups play easy-swinging jazz. The dance floor fills up with yuppie couples in their 20's, retired couples in their 60's, tourists out on the town, office-mates celebrating a birthday, mothers dancing with grown-up sons. It's a vision of a bygone New York, literally above it all.   The punk parade of St. Mark's Place starts to thin out about a block west of Sin-e, a street-level storefront where neighborhood folks drop in to hear people pour out their souls with the help of acoustic guitars. Sin-e is the 1990's version of the 1960's coffeehouse; longhaired post-hippies share space with pierced college students, and plugging in is not prohibited. It's a small place, with fewer than a dozen tables and a simple cleared space against one wall as a stage; cappuccino and cake are on the menu. Singer-songwriters are one of pop's most persistent species, and Sin-e puts on up to four performers a night, with hourly sets beginning at 8 P.M. They might be singing about politics, picking the blues or bemoaning lost love. On a slow night, performers say hello to each new arrival; on crowded ones, or on nights when a well-known performer (often an Irish one) drops by for a surprise set, Sin-e can be like a subway car filled with sensitivity.   With vine-painted columns and African instruments on the walls, S.O.B.'s (for Sounds of Brazil) presents New York as the port of call for music of the tropics: from Senegal, Brazil, Nigeria, Trinidad, Puerto Rico, Zaire, and other places where traditional music has annexed electric guitars. S.O.B.'s, on Varick Street at Houston, is a halfway house between ethnic clubs and the rock circuit, finding new audiences for bands outside their own enclave; its crowds are as hybrid as the music. Tall, dreadlocked Jamaicans shimmy alongside tie-dyed hippies on reggae nights; Haitian bands inspire fervent sing-alongs in Creole. Potent rum concoctions add to the rhythm-induced intoxication. One caveat: Announced set times are sometimes highly conjectural.   Jazz musicians may face agoraphobia when they leave their usual basements and smoky bars for the Tavern on the Green's Chestnut Room, near Central Park West at 67th Street. Part ski chalet, part Winter Palace, it has a high, open-beamed ceiling, a view of a lantern-draped garden cafe outside and, when the lights go down, flickering candles to augment bejeweled chandeliers. Of course, the Tavern is a tourist trap, with a busy gift shop, but the Chestnut Room is also a winning combination of an epicurean restaurant and music showcase. Bookings are genteel: cabaret singers one week, the plush Illinois Jacquet big band the next. And while most visitors dine before the music begins (entrees cost $20 to $30), the Chestnut Room's secret is that there's no required minimum, just a music charge of $12.50 to $18.50. There might be a chattering tour group at the next table, or a couple celebrating a 25th anniversary; the music and twinkling lights cast a romantic glow.   Tramps, on West 21st Street, with a capacity of 1,000, mutates between a club and a dance hall. It usually books bands with a sense of roots: country, reggae, garage-rock, funk, blues. When Tramps brings in someone like George Jones or Little Richard, it's a sit-down club, but when an alternative-rock sensation or an Irish rock band comes in, the tables disappear and the broad, semicircular dance floor becomes a mosh pit. The less intrepid take refuge in back at the bar. Most often, the communal frenzy tends to be good-natured; the place is sweaty but amiable.   There's some live music at the Tunnel -- usually tucked away downstairs in a rec-room-styled basement. But most of the Tunnel, in a warehouse building on 12th Avenue at 27th Street, at Chelsea's western fringe, is a dance club -- actually, multiple dance clubs, a New York City department store of a discotheque. People in their early 20's, dressed for modern mating rituals in anything from fluorescent orange overalls to black cocktail outfits, wait outside a velvet rope to be admitted to a warren of dance rooms. The main one, thumping to house and techno music with lyrics like \\"I've really got the hots for you,\\" has a skateboarding ramp at one end. There's also a disco room, an alternative-rock room, a vest-pocket dance floor with rap and reggae, and conversation zones with couches or padded walls.    The Village Vanguard, on Seventh Avenue South, is just a Greenwich Village basement, down a narrow flight of steps, where a crusty doorkeeper waits to collect the cover charge. The room itself is shaped like a crumbling slice of pie, with worn banquettes, undistinguished tables and chairs, The 123 seats hold an assortment of longtime jazz buffs, collegiate types trying to upgrade from Kenny G, and groups of Japanese or European tourists. Pillars make it impossible for most of the audience to see the whole stage, so regulars strategize over whether to choose the pianist's side, the drummer's side or maybe a place back at the bar. But once the musicians start playing, it's easy to hear why the Vanguard has been a hallowed jazz spot for most of its six decades. The acoustics are magnificent: Saxophones declaim, piano notes gleam, every drum tap and bass line is crisply defined. A Vanguard engagement is a rite of passage for a purist jazz musician; after all, the walls still hold reverberations of gigs by John Coltrane, Miles Davis, Thelonious Monk, Charles Mingus and Bill Evans. At the Vanguard, musicians play as if those ghosts might still be listening. Navigating the music places     Bottom Line, 15 West Fourth Street, at Mercer Street, (212) 228-7880.

Andy Warhol has produced a film that is half Bosch and half bosh.At its best \\"The Chelsea Girls\\" is a travelogue of hell—a grotesque ménagerie of lost souls whimpering in a psychedelic moonscape of neon red and fluorescent blue.At its worst it is a bunch of home movies in which Mr. Warhol's friends, asked to do something for the camera, can think of nothing much to do.\\"The Chelsea Girls\\" takes its title, and whatever unity it may be said to have, from the Chelsea Hotel, where all of its characters are supposed to be living.By using a split screen—first in black-and-white, then in color—Mr. Warhol lets us spy on several sets of characters at once: Lesbians, homosexuals, drug addicts and other denizens of the Lower Depths, 1966.The vision ought to be harrowing. Once it is.In an evil red glow, an empty-eyed young man with a Prince Valiant haircut goes into a drugged striptease. \\"I'm the kind of person that lingers in people's minds,\\" he mutters. \\"It's good nobody can see inside me.\\"In this moment we hear an authentic human voice in an authentic cry for help—a cry that is neither (as so much of \\"The Chelsea Girls\\" is) a put-on nor a put-down. We are being leveled with, and we cannot help responding.Again, there is a long scene toward the end of the film in which another young man talks with us, quite seriously and quite hilariously, about his responsibilities as the Pope—\\"It's not easy. But then it isn't hard, either. It's just something you are.\\"This young man is putting us on, of course. But it is easy to see, too, that \\"Pope\\" is a not-despicable metaphor for the kind of shepherd or leader or even saint that he wants to be. The image comes clearer when he mutters (just before clouting the girl whose \\"confession\\" he hears): \\"The Roman Catholic Church has disappeared, and Greenwich Village is in its place.\\"These are some moments that linger with the reviewer after three-and-a-half hours of \\"The Chelsea Girls.\\" The rest of the film suffers from two faults.The first is Mr. Warhol's infantile way with his camera and sound equipment.

Ever since the bull market began in August 1982, it has been nurtured repeatedly by rising bond prices and falling yields. In the constant tug-of-war for investor money, lower rates enhance the attractiveness of stocks by reducing the return in fixed-income securities.   Rates, however, reversed course on Wednesday, when Government statistics stunned money managers and economists alike with a surge of 320,000 workers on nonfarm payrolls in December. Bond prices sagged amid forecasts that rates would not decline over the near term. The Dow Jones industrial average reacted by plunging 39.10 points in its biggest one-day point drop.

Mornings she attended classes at the University of Massachusetts","excerpt":"afternoons she worked as a stripper and bar girl. ''Naked Is the Best Disguise'' is the harrowing cautionary tale of her sojourn in the often violent netherworld of Boston's Combat Zone, where as ''Lolita'' she stripped out of a little-girl costume, using a doll as her prop. Why would a young woman with, presumably, other options choose this way to make a living? Her stated reasons - not enough money from her estranged family, boredom with office and restaurant jobs and fierce sexual competition with her older sister, who was also a stripper - seem too simple. Miss Lewin also alludes to, but unfortunately never expands on, a ''need to put myself in the most hostile environment and wage a struggle for survival there.'' Initially, at least, stripping seemed to offer an affirmation, however crude, of her sexual power and desirability. But the illusion of glamour was harder to sustain while hustling drinks. As time went on, Miss Lewin, who was turning into a feminist, became dependent on cocaine so Lolita could do her job. Ultimately, as the strain of her double life became unbearable and her cocaine habit threatened to get out of control, she pulled back from the abyss. Some of Miss Lewin's feminist insights seem to have been slapped on after the fact, and they have a flattening effect on her narrative.

Or they recall that Bennington is where Camille Paglia, the woman who later published the brilliant, maddening \\"Sexual Personae,\\" kicked a student three times for parodying her Uzi lecture style","excerpt":"afterward she claimed that the kicks were parodic, too. From the legendary days of the 1940's, when Miriam Marx, Groucho's daughter, was said to have quartered her horse in her dorm room -- and afterward was suspended from the college -- Bennington has been American higher education's School for Scandal.   But, I often find myself insisting (sometimes after adding a few tales of my own), it's been a good deal more than that. Bennington is one of the places where Martha Graham helped invent modern dance. It's where Kenneth Burke, the great critic and man of letters, taught for many years, along with Stanley Kunitz, Howard Nemerov, Stanley Edgar Hyman, Theodore Roethke, W. H. Auden, Bernard Malamud; the list goes on. Bennington has been the home of major composers like Henry Brant and Vivian Fine. A number of consequential American artists have been associated with the college, among them Jules Olitski, David Smith, Kenneth Noland, Helen Frankenthaler. At Bennington, Buckminster Fuller built one of his first geodesic domes. The school pioneered workshop approaches to writing and set the arts on par with the academic disciplines before much of anyone else was willing to. Bennington was originally a women's college, and its feminism has often been well in advance of the rest of the country's.

Will the work of the generation of the 70's hold up as well? If it doesn't hold up, should blame for its weakness be laid at the door of the awful decade of the 60's?

August 1, 1999, beloved husband of the late Bitten H. Simon, loving father of Cathy and her husband Michael Palmer & John Simon. Cherished grandfather of Sarah Palmer. A Memorial Service will be announced at a later date. Contributions in his memory may be made to The Dr. Bernard E. Simon and Bitten H. Simon R.N. Scholarship Fund, at The Johns Hopkins University.     SIMON-Bernard E., M.D. The Trustees, Faculty and Staff of Mount Sinai School of Medicine and The Mount Sinai Hospital of Mount Sinai NYU Health deeply mourn the passing of our dear friend and esteemed colleague, Bernard E. Simon, M.D., Clinical Professor of Surgery Emeritus, who was associated with Mount Sinai for more than 60 years. Dr. Simon was an internationally renowned plastic surgeon, and one of three physicians who donated their services to a group of severely disfigured atomic-bomb survivors known as the Hiroshima Maidens, who underwent reconstructive surgery at Mount Sinai. Dr. Simon was born in Brooklyn in 1912, received his medical degree from Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and joined Mount Sinai in 1937 as a Surgical Intern. As a young surgeon, he helped to establish Mount Sinai's Division of Plastic Surgery, under the late Dr. Arthur Barsky, and he served as Chief of the Division from 1965 until his retirement from active practice in 1979. In 1955, Dr. Simon, Dr. Barsky, and the late Dr. Sidney Kahn volunteered to perform 140 reconstructive procedures on 25 women from Hiroshima, Japan, who were severely disfigured in the World War II atomic bombing of their home city. The project also supported the establishment of the specialty of plastic surgery in Japan by providing funding for the training of three young Japanese plastic surgeons, one of whom later wrote the definitive textbook on plastic surgery in his country. Dr. Simon was reunited with some of the women in 1985 when he was invited to Japan for ceremonies marking the 30th anniversary of the project","excerpt":"again in 1995 when one of them visited Mount Sinai to mark the 40th anniversary; and most recently in 1996 when four of them attended a conference on international medical cooperation held at Mount Sinai to mark the 41st anniversary of the project. In addition to being a skilled and compassionate surgeon, Dr. Simon was a dedicated teacher and scholar throughout his career. He was the author of more than 50 papers, a member of numerous professional associations and societies, and the recipient of numerous awards, including an honorary membership in the Japanese Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons and The Jacoby Medallion, the highest honor of The Mount Sinai Alumni. Throughout his long association with Mount Sinai, Dr. Simon was a model of dedication, integrity and personal warmth, and he will be remembered not only for his professional achievements, but for his generosity of spirit. We extend sincere condolences to his children, Cathy and John Robert, to his granddaughter, Sarah, and to the entire family. Helene L. Kaplan, Chair, Mount Sinai School of Medicine Stephen M. Peck, Chair, Mount Sinai NYU Health Arthur H. Rubenstein, MBBCh, Dean, Mount Sinai School of Medicine John W. Rowe, MD, President, Mount Sinai NYU Health Barry R. Freedman, President, The Mount Sinai Hospital Joel Bauer, MD, President, Medical Board    SIMON-Bernard E., M.D. It is with profound sorrow that The Mount Sinai Alumni mourns the passing of our distinguished friend and colleague. A pillar of the Mount Sinai community for more than sixty years, Dr. Simon joined the staff as an intern in 1937, having placed first (out of 300) on the internship examination. When a formal residency was established in 1941 he was one of two given a position. In 1965, Dr. Simon was appointed Head of the Division of Plastic Surgery in which post he served until 1979. He then continued to teach until his retirement from practice in his eightieth year. An outstanding, devoted clinician and talented surgeon, Dr. Simon was admired and respected by his colleagues and patients, but above all, earned a special affection by his profound humanity, generosity, warm smile and gentle humor. All these qualities were demonstrated in his care for the Hiroshima Maidens (victims of the atomic blast that ended W.W. II). This was a task that he especially cherished for it was his opportunity to use his skills for truly humanitarian purposes. In 1978, the Mount Sinai Alumni presented its most coveted award, the Jacobi Medallion, to Dr. Simon in acknowledgment of his outstanding professional achievements and his extraordinary service to the Medical Center and the Alumni. As a clinician, his fusion of scientific skill and compassionate concern for the well-being of the individual patient has exemplified the most noble aspiration of the medical profession. A caring and beloved physician, he will be missed. Our sincere condolences are extended to his children Cathy and John Robert, and to the entire family. Avi Barbasch, M.D., President Jeffrey S.

More important, the actress moves quickly past the moment and stays in character, half-trying to seduce the young man while plotting jewel heists in this quirky dark comedy (made in 1991 and never before shown in the United States).

For Mr. Mamoulian has the eye of a poet and his camera man, Victor Milner, has the poet's skill.Between them they create those only partly articulate moods of rapture and sadness in the contemplation of a woman's beauty which are the proper study of all art, and not least of the visual. The venerable tragedy becomes, in its present drastically revised edition, the framework for an enormously interesting embroidery.Miss Dietrich, in scenes of exquisite composition, becomes the embodiment of that pure passion which sings in \\"The Song of Solomon.\\" Truly, she walks in beauty in the pastel country scenes in the Spring, with the flower petals and the warm tracery of the shadows on the green, and the sun luminous in her hair, touching her teeth and glinting the surface of gold-flecked waters","excerpt":"again in the formal white beauty of the scenes in the sculptor's studio, with the contrast of the frozen marble figures around her, and once more in the russet melancholy of the scenes in the Baron's castle.A guileless country girl, as the story opens, Lily has been desolated by the death of her father, and she goes to live in Berlin with her tipsy and tyrannical aunt. In the young sculptor across the street from the shabby circulating library the girl glimpses the fulfillment of the dream of love she had found in the biblical love songs. The youth induces the girl to pose for him, and in the nights she slips off to his studio. As the statue of the girl takes form, imprisoning her white innocence in the marble, she reveals her affection for him, and they spend many days together in the country.When the youth's wealthy patron, Baron von Merzbach, cunningly persuades him that he must give the girl up for the sake of his art, Lily is bitterly hurt and consents to marry the old man. Her chill demeanor toward her husband finally infuriates the Baron to a point where he invites the sculptor to the castle and after a morbid evening of jealousy and recrimination the three separate. Lily becomes a demimondaine, returning finally with her old lover to the studio and to the statue which immortalizes the dream in her that is now dead.To this somewhat conventional history of a woman's collapse, Mr. Mamoulian brings a sophisticated and finely stylized manner. He produces moments of visual excitement by elaborating the details of mood and emotion.Miss Dietrich is superbly suited to the changing tones of innocent and sensuous beauty. She realizes the full impact of her climactic scenes by understating her acting. The cast, losing importance in a film where the director and his star so obviously dominate, is entirely excellent in support of Miss Dietrich. As the sculptor, Brian Aherne is intelligent and effective in his first American film appearance. Lionel Atwill invests the rôle of the Baron with grossness, pomp and sly humor. Alison Skip-worth as the bibulous old aunt and Hardie Albright as an admirer of Lily's (playing the Walter von Prell part, which bears no relation to the same character in the novel) are helpful.If \\"The Song of Songs\\" had to be brought back to the living screen it could not have enjoyed a more satisfactory production.
