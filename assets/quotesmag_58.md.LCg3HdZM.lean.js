Some of the additions are below, paired with the mainstream understanding of evolutionary biology.   KENNETH CHANG    SOME ADDITIONS TO KANSAS SCIENCE STANDARDS    Biological evolution postulates an unguided natural process that has no discernible direction or goal.    The view that living things in all the major kingdoms are modified descendants of a common ancestor (described in the pattern of a branching tree) has been challenged in recently by such things as: Discrepancies in the molecular evidence (e.g., differences in relatedness inferred from sequence studies of different proteins) previously thought to support that view.    Whether microevolution (change within a species) can be extrapolated to explain macroevolutionary changes (such as new complex organs or body plans and new biochemical systems which appear irreducibly complex) is controversial.    Some of the scientific criticisms include:  a. A lack of empirical evidence for a ''primordial soup'' or a chemically hospitable pre-biotic atmosphere","excerpt":"b. The lack of adequate natural explanations for the genetic code, the sequences of genetic information necessary to specify life, the biochemical machinery needed to translate genetic information into functional biosystems, and the formation of protocells; and  c. The sudden rather than gradual emergence of organisms near the time that the Earth first became habitable.    RESPONSE OF MAINSTREAM SCIENTISTS    ''Unguided'' is ''a very slippery word,'' said Glenn Branch, deputy director of the National Center for Science Education. Scientific explanations of all natural processes, from hurricanes to supernovas, are all ''unguided.''    The family tree relationships of some of the early life forms remain unclear. But fossil and biological evidence argues that all life today descends from the earliest organisms. Not surprisingly, new methods like comparison of proteins or genes have generated family trees that differ somewhat from those deduced from fossils. But those differences have not fundamentally changed scientists' view of evolution or common descent.    Most biologists do not make the distinction between microevolution and macroevolution; the larger changes are simply the accumulation of small changes. Most also say that the issue is not controversial and that there is much experimental evidence to indicate that such changes have occurred.    The term ''irreducibly complex'' is used by Michael Behe, a professor of biology at Lehigh University who is one of the main proponents of intelligent design, but is not used by other biologists.    The issue of how life originated is different from that of evolution. Current ideas on the origin of life are incomplete and no consensus has yet emerged. Most scientists find that this means more research is needed, not that it is impossible for a theory to emerge.   Evolution and Its Discontents"},{"year":"1976","title":"Baumann, Michael L: B Traven.

The man in charge, Brian Smouha of Touche Ross & Company in London, is a veteran asset hunter. As the liquidator for Banco Ambrosiano, the Vatican bank that collapsed in 1982, he eventually recovered for creditors roughly $800 million of losses placed at $1.3 billion.   But the Banco Ambrosiano case pales next to B.C.C.I. in terms of size and legal complexity. Moreover, Mr. Smouha and his team of provisional liquidators are facing a Dec. 2 court deadline in London for drawing up a worldwide settlement plan. \\"It will be a cliffhanger,\\" said one person involved in the negotiations.

The shadowy banking empire exploited holes in the net of global banking supervision for years. Yet for banking regulators, there has been one measure of comfort: unlike notorious international banking failures in the past, the collapse of B.C.C.I. did not prompt a scare in the world's financial markets or banking system.   The coordinated swoop on July 5 by Britain and other countries to seize the bank's assets was a byproduct of reforms in international banking supervision in the wake of two previous major bank scandals, the 1974 failure of Germany's Bankhaus I.D. Herstatt and the 1982 collapse of Italy's Banco Ambrosiano. The worldwide seizure was timed just before the financial markets opened that morning. \\"It relied on a very high degree of cooperaton by the central banks,\\" said E.

Use toothpicks stuck into the sides of the potato, if needed, to keep an inch or so of the base in water. Put the potato in light but not full sun and soon roots and green shoots will develop. Keep the roots covered with water.&#8221; From Nancy J., a Manhattan reader, &#8220;Wash a sweet potato in warm water, cut it in half and suspend the halves cut side down over a glasi of water with one&#8208;third of the potato submerged. Purple knobs will appear which turn into leaves and thin roots from the bottom will soon appear. In a month, pot in ordinary soil, leaving the rounded top exposed.&#8221; From Harriet Cohen, another Manhattan reader, &#8220;Find a sweet potato that hasn't been treated with chemicals to prevent bud sprouting. Once a natural sweet potato is found, wash it and place it on a bed of medium&#8208;sized pebbles arranged in a shallow bowl. Partially fill with water so the water touches the bottom of the sweet potato. Lovely vines will develop and the tuber can in soil.&#8221; Answers/Questions"},{"year":"1921","title":"ALLOWED TO CUT WAGES AS RECEIVER OF ROAD","excerpt":"B.L.

But don't count him out. In May, Harvard University Press plans to publish ''On Hashish,'' a slim volume of Benjamin's little-known writings about his occasional drug use. It's got a good chance of becoming this year's version of Harry Frankfurt's ''On Bull - - - -,'' an academic book that makes it onto the front tables at Barnes & Noble. (Harvard says its volume was in the works before Frankfurt's book took off.) Benjamin experimented with hashish and other drugs in the late 1920's and early 30's, after being recruited by friends as a test subject. ''On Hashish'' is mostly culled from his notes for a book he planned to write. Benjamin wasn't always fond of hashish's effects -- he referred to the drug as ''poison'' -- but he did experience an ample amount of what he called ''profane illumination.'' His notes have the makings of a cerebral dorm-room stoner classic. Here are three of Benjamin's observations: a) ''Feeling of understanding Poe much better now''","excerpt":"b) ''One seeks occasions for laughter''; c) ''Oven turns into cat.''

The story, dressed in the rich hues of Cine-color, has the simplicity of a bedtime tale. Old John, the hermit, has been communing with nature in the sylvan fastnesses of a California redwood grove for so long that he is linguistically in rapport with such animals as a crow, an eagle, a frog, a dog and a puma. Saving the forest owners' grandson from a raging stream after a trainwreck, Old John raises the infant to childhood. And it is only after a series of melodramatic developments (the dénouement is pretty obvious) that the youngster rejoins his bereaved mother and Old John is assured that his beloved forest will remain primeval.Harry Davenport plays Old John simply and gracefully, while Billy Severn, as his youthful charge, Brenda Joyce, as the mother and Edmund Lowe, as a helpful doctor, turn in sympathetic and competent performances. If the trip through this forest is not altogether enchanting, it is, at least, unhurried and pleasant.

The concerts are benefits for the organ itself: although it sounds healthy and is said to be showing no strain, the church's music office has prudently arranged for a maintenance overhaul in October 1994. The organ will be dismantled, cleaned, regulated and restored, a process that will take 10 weeks and will cost about $80,000.

The death of Francois Leydet brings to end a life filled with joy, adventure, love and accomplishment. Born 26 August 1927 at Neuilly-sur-Seine (France), he became a U.S. citizen in 1956 after attending prep school and colleges in both France and the U.S.: bachelor's degree, University of Paris, 1945","excerpt":"bachelor's degree, Harvard University, 1947; Harvard Business School, 1948/9 and 1950/62; School of Advanced International Studies, Johns Hopkins University, 1952/3. Fluent in English and French, Francois spoke several other languages and delighted in puns and other word play. In recent years he devoted much effort to institutions he believed in, serving as a docent at the Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum, and as an active worker and supporter of Planned Parenthood. Among his many ''careers'' were experience in investment banking, wrangler on ranches in Oregon, crewing shrimpboats in the Gulf of California, and rowing dories through the Grand Canyon, but always there was writing. Starting as a copyboy for the Washington ''Evening Star'' in 1953, Francois worked at the San Francisco ''Chronicle'', 1954/62, and ''Examiner'', 1962/3, before turning to freelance writing, specializing in nature, wildlife and conservation subjects, for the remainder of his life. He edited and wrote books for the Sierra Club (''Tomorrow's Wilderness'', 1963, ''The Last Redwoods'', 1963, the award winning ''Time and the River Flowing''-about the Grand Canyon-1964), and a comprehensive book about the maligned and misunderstood coyote, ''The Coyote, Defiant Songdog of the West'', 1977; passengers on his river trips can remember Francois climbing on the ledges above the river and howling like a coyote and in later years at least one friend often referred to him as ''The Old Coyote''. Francois' essays and articles appeared in magazines and journals as diverse as ''National Geographic'', ''American West'', ''Holiday'', ''Harvard Magazine'' and ''Vogue''. Though never published, his sonnets, odes and other poetry were a delight shared with his friends and family. Francois died Tuesday, March 4, of complications following a diagnosis and treatment for lung cancer, in Tucson, Arizona, where he lived with his wife Roslyn since 1990. He leaves cherished dogs, Bruno, Max, Mortimer and Emma. Francois is survived by the people he loved, who adored him in return, his wife of 27 years, Roslyn (Tucson), his step-children: Walter Robb (San Francisco), Dr. Rachel Avery (Portland, ME), Holly Prunty (Palo Alto), Peckie Peters (Vail), and 9-3/4 grandchildren. His siblings are brother Hugues Leydet (Montreal, Canada) and sister Beatrice Mosca (Rome, Italy). A Memorial service will be held later in the spring after grandchild 10 is born. The family requests that memorial donations in lieu of flowers or other memorials be made to the Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum or Planned Parenthood.

In fact, Peggy Lee settled for $3,500 back in 1952 for providing four of the character voices and co-writing six of the songs in \\"Lady and the Tramp.\\" But when the company raked in $72 million from video sales of the animated feature in recent years, Miss Lee figured she had some more money coming. California courts agreed, despite a Disney attorney's argument that Walt Disney considered the animated characters to be the real stars of his films, and Roy Disney's testimony that his uncle never shared profits with voice performers. Last week the court awarded Miss Lee $3.83 million. Now Disney is about to hear from other voices, including Mary Costa, an opera singer who was the voice of the princess in \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" and who announced a multimillion-dollar suit against Disney in Florida last week.

One of his first projects was the construction, with several other up-and-coming architects, of 22 model homes on Napraforgó Utca (Sunflower Street), a utopian vision of how lower-middle-class Hungarian families might one day live. Completed in 1931, the neighborhood, with its quiet park, futuristic street lamps and cantilevered balconies, wasn't a success at first. The houses were actually far beyond the means of an average family and remained difficult to sell for decades. Today, however, the buildings -- a mix of functionalist white cubes and nouveau-peasant villas -- are getting the tenants and the attention they deserve. ''I visited this street very often, even as a child,'' says Ilona Rév, author of the forthcoming ''From the Bauhaus to the Glass Pyramid.'' ''There were no trees there yet, just saplings, and most of the houses were empty. Nowadays, the street is full of majestic trees and foliage, and the homes are also full of families.''

Cost too is a concern. No one yet knows exactly how much even a basic missile shield would cost, and estimates run as high as $100 billion. But most challenging will be the technological hurdles, which many experts say are beyond current capabilities. How to reliably find a warhead in a field of decoys? Can a laser be powerful and focused enough to kill from a safe distance? And what combination, if any, of ground-, sea-, air- and space-based defenses will sufficiently defend against all possible threats?

The death sentence against Mr. Hussein is still under review by an appeals court, but hundreds of people have already started lobbying the prime minister's office for the position.

A8    Lawyers See Rumsfeld Liability  Lawyers for former detainees in Iraq and Afghanistan argued in federal court that Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld was personally responsible, and thus legally liable, for acts of torture inflicted on their clients by American military interrogators.

A10    New Draft of Iran Sanctions  Europeans produced a revised draft of a Security Council resolution on Iran and said they would introduce it in the hope of a speedy vote on action to curb its nuclear program.

Mitt Romney, the Massachusetts Republican who has built a presidential campaign on a broad appeal for conservative support, is drawing increased criticism from conservative activists for his advocacy of gay rights in the 1990s.

This alternately lachrymose, laughable and bellicose feature is called \\"The Broadway Melody,\\" a title that refers to a song composed and rendered by the leading male character. Although the audible device worked exceedingly well in most instances, it is questionable whether it would not have been wiser to leave some of the voices to the imagination, or, at least to have refrained from having a pretty girl volleying slang at her colleagues.The story was written by Edmund Goulding, and it is one that has not taxed his imagination severely, for it merely concerns the shattered illusions and hopes of two small-time dancing and singing girls who, having been successful in their sphere, decide to give Broadway the benefit of their talents. While this film boasts of many a gruff incident, it has been rather cleverly directed by Harry Beaumont, who in the old days of silent pictures was responsible for the guidance of the picturization of \\"Beau Brummell.\\" The dialogue, according to the program, was supplied by Norman Houston and James Gleason, and there are some apt remarks, but up to the last episode the harsh utterances slip off every pair of lips, except those of the wealthy libertine.There are wild outbursts of rage that are invariably well portrayed, but at the same time they are frequently a little trying on one's nerves. So far as its entertainment value is concerned, it is a matter whether one likes to see and hear so much of the upsets of chorus girls and their ilk.There is a young lady named Queenie, another called Hank and an exuberant male individual named Eddie. None of these stoops to many phrases that do not contain a word or two of Broadway's none too edifying parlance. Yet this somewhat obvious tale of the footlights with all its harshness holds a certain interest.The characters of Eddie and Hank are fairly well outlined, but Queenie is a vacillating blonde, who is constantly being told of her beauty. She is chosen during a black moment to stand on a pedestal and for some none too apparent reason everybody goes wild about this girl.The plot concerns the love of Eddie and Queenie for each other but as Eddie is at first engaged to marry Hank they, for obvious reasons, decide to keep their feelings to each other. Queenie does not even let Eddie know that she loves him until the yarn is well under way. The self-sacrificing Hank tries to save Queenie from the rich philanderer and evenutally Eddie is spurred on to rescue the girl.The sentiment is served out too generously in most of the sequences, but Bessie Love, who impersonates Hank, is capital in either her tempestuous or tearful periods. She reveals imagination in dealing with her part, notably during one stretch when she is weeping as she lathers her face with cold cream. She is, however, made to appear a little too self-reliant and impudent in some of the early passages.Anita Page figures as Queenie. She is blonde and she is beautiful. Her acting, especially her voice, does not enhance her personality. Notwithstanding, it must be admitted that there are girls who talk as she is made to for the screen. Miss Page, however, fails to give one an impression of spontaneity, for she recites rather than speaks her lines.Charles King gives a vigorous conception of Eddie. And in his singing interludes he is not altogether disappointing. Distance, however, does not subdue his intonation, for as a mite on the screen he is just as loud as in a semi-close-up.A somewhat entertaining character study is delivered by Jed Prouty, who plays Uncle Bernie, a tonguetied booking agent. His faltering moments are most amusing and it invariably happens that he can't get the word out at the psychological moment and is forced to change to another word that comes easier to him. Edward Dillon is forceful and genuine as the stage manager.A dream sequence in color is effectively and amusingly pictured.\\"The Broadway Melody\\" is prefaced by a short audible drama called \\"Confession,\\" based on a playlet by Kenyon Nicholson. It is admirably directed by Lionel Barrymore. The action is persuasive but grim. It all takes place in a French estaminet during the war. Robert Ames and Carroll Nye give comprehensive performances in the male rôles, and Christian Yves and Yvonne Stark are excellent as the French mother and daughter.

But a study published last week in The New England Journal of Medicine used M.R.I. scans to examine the spines of 98 people who had no back pain. Two-thirds of them had spinal abnormalities, including herniated disks and degenerated ones. If such problems had been seen in someone with back pain, they might have justified an operation. The researchers concluded that in many cases it may be sheer coincidence -- not cause and effect -- when a person with back pain is found to have an abnormal disk.
