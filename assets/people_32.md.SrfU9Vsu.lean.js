Landau (Bobbie), his oldest daughter Madeline Landau, a political anthropologist, and his youngest daughter Claudia Landau, MD, gerontology. Marty Landau (as he would say, ''the school teacher, not the actor'') was born in 1921 in Brooklyn, New York, to Harry and Clara Landau and is survived by his brothers, Gerry and Herb, and his sister Bernice. After distinguished service in the U.S. Army during World War II, Martin received his BA from Brooklyn College and Ph.D. in Political Science from New York University of New York-joining the Department of Political Science at U.C. Berkeley in 1971, where he taught until retirement. He was the recipient of numerous awards for his renowned teaching and scholarly work in organization theory, decision theory and the philosophy of social science-which included the application of the theory of redundancy to the design of effective organizational systems. His awards include the Danforth Foundation Harbison Award for Distinguished Teaching and Scholarship, and the Docteur Honoris Causa from the University of Paris. He served as a John Simon Guggenheim Fellow","excerpt":"a fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences; and as a senior fellow at the National Academy of Public Administration. Martin founded and directed the Hong Kong Project for 17 years-a professional development program in organization and decision theory, funded by the Hong Kong Government, at the Goldman School of Public Policy. He served as a consultant on organizational design in the United States and abroad, including Thailand, Italy, France, the Philippines and Nepal. Martin Landau supported the labor movement and the civil rights movement - contributing to Thurgood Marshall's historic planning sessions for Brown Vs the Board of Education. He was dedicated to the racial integration of education and all institutions - and worked closely with Horace Bond at Lincoln University and with John H. Franklin at Brooklyn College. His motto was FDR's ''the only thing to fear is fear itself''. His political and intellectual commitment will continue through an application of organization theory to effective strategies of social change for the poor and discriminated ethnic communities in the United States. Gifts and donations in his memory can be made to the Martin Landau Center on Organization and Social Change at the Institute of Governmental Studies, at U.C. Berkeley (510) 642-1474.

Ms. Davies has always been interested in dance, and her current exhibition features a fascinating six-screen piece,  ''DAVID TUDOR'S OCEAN,''  which documents three performances of the same work by the Merce Cunningham Dance Company. The focus is more on the composers -- Mr. Tudor and Takehisa Kosugi -- than the dancers, but it's a compelling and extensive look at the fabric of an artwork. Also on show is the premiere of ''Desire,'' with text by the poet Anne Carson. Through Feb. 18, Zone: Chelsea Center for the Arts, 601 West 26th Street, (212) 255-2177 or www.zonechelsea.org.

It is prefaced by a chapter in natural colors wherein is depicted the luxurious existence at Palm Beach. At the close there is another prismatic episode which is just as effective.Here you have a pretty girl, a panorama of Palm Beach as a background, a good-looking hero and a casual sort of villain, not to say anything of some clever comedy. It may not seem at all likely that a girl would become terribly excited because a cigarette had set her parasol on fire, but you feel perfectly willing to excuse all the hubbub. Perhaps there are not many mothers who bring their daughters up to be beautiful just so that they may marry a millionaire, but you are willing to pardon this weakness on the part of Mrs. Courage. She has seen hard times, knows the meaning of the pinch of poverty and, realizing that Jewel, her daughter, possesses both charm and good looks, she is eager that the girl marry a wealthy man, with a hope that it will also be a love match.Not long after the story starts Jewel displays her ingenuity at making hats by purloining her father's new $3 hat and cutting, shaping and trimming it so that it is snatched at by an oil king's widow for $100.The triumphant young man in this tale is John Jeffrey Fleet, who, on discovering that his valet Vicary has been wearing his clothes during his (Fleet's) absence, decides to permit Vicary to play the rich man while he (Fleet) officiates as Vicary's chauffeur. Fleet permits himself some license and avails himself of the use of his own car when it comes to helping Jewel out of an awkward predicament. Jewel is to a certain extent a good deal of a feminine show-off. It pleases her to stand on the terrace of an expensive hotel and ask the doorman to call her car, knowing, of course, that there will be no answer. She is on the point of saying what an exasperating chauffeur she has, when Fleet, clothed as a chauffeur, drives up to the steps and salutes Jewel.That Jewel really has a great affection for this chauffeur there is no doubt, but she is averse to the idea of love in a cottage. Hence it is clear that Vicary must be brought upon the scene, and what with a diamond ring given to him by the oil king's widow and his many references to fabulous wealth, Jewel is ensnared. But the author has found a way of making Jewel, her mother and father and Fleet quite happy at the end.Olive Borden is attractive and capable as Jewel. Neil Hamilton seems to have learned a great deal more about acting since his previous screen work. Marie Dressler officiates as the ponderous widow of the oil king. Jerry Miley has a great deal of savoir faire for a valet, but it is not exactly amiss in this film.

She was, of course, a powerful, smart woman a year ago. Back then, her husband's Presidential campaign advisers seemed worried that these attributes had limited appeal. But after a week in which Mrs. Clinton appeared before one Congressional committee after another, delivering carefully articulated answers to vexing questions about the cost and practice of medicine, even Congressional Republicans -- whose party convention last year stigmatized her as a radical, antifamily feminist -- complimented her on her grasp of the debate and her service to the country.

On Tuesday night, Catalyst, the research and advocacy organization she founded in 1962, will throw a dinner to honor companies that have heeded her messages, companies with female-friendly policies. The organization will also honor Ms. Schwartz, who will retire in May.   As she ponders retirement -- an impending life change she appears to regard as liberation into different but not necessarily fewer activities -- Ms. Schwartz insists it is not a source of frustration that she will almost certainly be remembered most for what she did not do.

In its wildly expressionistic opening sequence, Catherine (Jade Leung), a waitress in an eerie, blue-lighted truck stop, goes berserk when a customer makes a pass at her, killing him and a police officer who has been called to the scene. At her arraignment, Catherine shoots her way out of a Los Angeles courtroom in a blitz of gunfire. Moments later, she is kidnapped by the C.I.A., which implants a microchip in her brain and trains her to become a political assassin with the code name Black Cat.

If Mr. Kravitz, who performed with the Cult at the Paramount Theater at Madison Square Garden on Wednesday night, is taken from any other angle, he comes off as an extraordinarily dim bore, albeit one with an entertaining, zeppelin-size ego and an ability to write real melodies.   Mr. Kravitz, like so many other rockers obsessed with style, makes a fetish of the late 1960's and early 70's, drawing on the Beatles, Jimi Hendrix and an occasional Stax single or two.

It is one that is chiefly interesting for the intelligent direction lent to it by Lionel Barrymore.It is quite evident that the producers intend to keep Mr. Gilbert, even now that he talks in his amorous scenes, before the public as the great screen lover, for in this current narrative this actor constantly repeats \\"I love you\\" to the Princess Orsolini as he kisses her. In fact, his many protestations of affection while embracing the charming girl, who is incidentally impersonated by Miss Owen, caused a large female contingent in the theatre yesterday afternoon to giggle and laugh.It is a slender story, but Mr. Barrymore has done a great deal to strengthen it. It has humor as well as romance, and Miss Owen, who is charming—in fact, unusually beautiful—dees her share to make it a success. Her enunciation is clear and pleasing. She is graceful and carries her rôle with a captivating air of aloofness.Mr. Barrymore is ever on the alert for fitting comedy, such as the characterization of Prince Luigi Caprilli. This Prince, who is at first betrothed to Princess Orsolini, is the antithesis to Captain Kovacs, for he is phlegmatic in his love and takes the Princess's jilting of him in a philosophic manner. He admits himself that if anything goes wrong with his breakfast it upsets him for the rest of the day. He evinces surprise that the Princess is able to cast her lot away from him, but such is life!Mr. Gilbert's responsibility does not lie with his lines and therefore he is to be congratulated on the manner in which he handles this speaking rôle. His voice is pleasant, but not one which is rich in nuances. His performance is good, but it would benefit by the suggestion of a little more wit. He, as one might presume, wears his officer's uniform as if he were bred in the army traditions.One of the outstanding incidents in this production is an officers' race on horseback. It is a splendid and exciting piece of work, no matter when and where it was photographed. And Mr. Barrymore enhances it with glimpses of the society throng. There are thrilling spills in the course of this event, which is won by the handsome Kovacs.Princess Orsolini, who is accompanied by her mother, quickly loses her heart to Captain Kovacs, but a contretemps happens when Kovacs insists that he is a peasant born. Soon, to punish the Princess for having obeyed her mother by calling off the love affair. Captain Kovacs causes himself to be arrested as a swindler, an impersonator of the real Kovacs.He accomplishes this piece of trickery so adroitly that the Princess and her mother as well as a Colonel of Gendarmes do not for a moment doubt the reported shady character of the undeniably good-looking fellow.It is General Ettinger, ably played by Peter Cawthorne, who on arriving upon the scene invites his friend Captain Kovacs to join him, the Princess and her mother. This greatly shocks the pretty Princess, but audiences who witness this film will hardly credit that Kovacs is as black as he paints himself. And he isn't.Gustav von Seyffertitz is excellent as the Colonel of Gendarmes.

The first set, featuring Ellery Eskelin and Andy Laster on saxophones, Paul Smoker on trumpet, Herb Robertson on valve trombone and Mr. Haynes on drums, flirted with the known.

Also under review are two exhibitions by native artists who teach - Tom Halsall, at Westchester Community College in Valhalla (through April 15), and the late George Cohen, at the Aileen Ryan Earnest Gallery in Scarsdale (Harwood Building, through Wednesday).   Both the Manhattanville shows are part of a festival devoted to Mr. Grass, of which the final event is ''Gunter Grass in Performance,'' to be staged Tuesday and Wednesday (for more details, call 694-2200).

What he taught was not a style but a way of working deeply through the torso, arms and legs without recourse, necessarily, to narrative, character, props or even facial expression. The variety of work produced by his students, who included Marcel Marceau, has been astonishing. And that variety was the implicit theme of the International Movement Theater Festival of New Mime, whose presentation at three theaters in Philadelphia ended today.   For the festival, Griftheater of Amsterdam restaged \\"Sa Griffe,\\" a recent piece drawn from Man Ray's \\"objects of affection\\" and created for a warehouse setting.

But the nonfiction books Mr. Crichton cites also tend to mix factual analyses of Japan's economic strength with hyperbolic visions of Japan's plot to run the United States. High on the list is \\"Agents of Influence\\" (1990) by Pat Choate, which is partly a thoughtful examination of influence peddling by all large corporations, but also partly a paranoid fantasy about Tokyo's alleged payoffs to influential Americans to achieve \\"effective political domination over the United States.\\" Is Japan Out to Get Us?"},{"year":"1936","title":"Aside from moderate buying enthusiasm for a few groups of stocks which lasted most of the day, the share market failed yesterday to maintain its early firmness and drifted downward.

That moment comes when the title character performs a slinky Hindu dance for the aristocratic guests at an elegant French salon. Lowering her eyes and twirling two red scarves, Mata Hari (Marguerite MacIntyre) slithers through the kind of hootchy-kootchy routine that was a staple of 1950's Hollywood costume dramas and that two generations of drag performers have enshrined as camp.         But the dance quickly winds down. And \\"Mata Hari\\" reveals itself as not a spoof but a deadly serious and lethally dull musical peddling a garbled message  about the futility of war. Why the estimable York Theater decided to revive the  show, which has music by Edward Thomas, a book by Jerome Coopersmith and lyrics  by Martin Charnin, is a mystery, for over the years \\"Mata Hari\\" has acquired notoriety as a legendary flop.

The film, about the revered 15th-century Russian icon painter, now runs 185 minutes, compared to the 146-minute version presented at the festival.

This melodramatic treatise on death and double dealing among vaudevillians is as labored an excursion as that of a tramp through a quagmire. Erich von Stroheim, who has run the gamut of sinister cinema citizens from Marshal Rommel to a ventriloquist, this time is both sinister and obvious as the title character. \\"Great\\" is scarcely descriptive of either \\"Flamarion\\" or this creaking vehicle.Perhaps Republic, the producers, had great expectations in assigning three writers to this somber adventure. What evolves seems hardly worth the trouble, since this item unfolds like something from the earliest film archives. As the star of a sharp-shooting act, Erich von Stroheim is drawn from his singular passion for his guns by Mary Beth Hughes, who, together with her husband, works in the act. Miss Hughes, it appears, is tired of her drunken spouse and suggests that von Stroheim \\"accidentally\\" kill him during a performance. The smitten trigger man takes the suggestion. But Miss Hughes, as brazen a package as ever was, hies herself off with another and younger actor. Needless to say, justice and vengeful sharpshooter eventually triumph.Among the supporting players, Dan Duryea is effective as the ill-fated husband, while Mary Beth Hughes is properly hard as the attractive lady who likes variety in her men.

That is, he was neither a militant opponent of the Tehran regime, nor had he been forced to flee Iran by persecution. Rather, he escaped the country in 1986 at age 17 out of an instinct for survival: to avoid fighting in the bloody Iran-Iraq war. For Iranian authorities he was simply a deserter.    When he finally returned home in 2000 after an amnesty, he found an Iran that was no longer the blazing cradle of the Islamic revolution. Mr. Khatibi, too, had changed: culturally, he was now much more French. And as an aspiring filmmaker, he wanted to record his reaction to Iran and share it with Iranians.

But, like some sermons, this earnest little cops-and-robbers item about a black-market gang, has a way of dulling rather than quickening the senses. Its hero is perhaps too strident in seeking his kind of justice, its plot and dialogue are of a hoary vintage, while its performances can hardly be termed inspired. What may be said in this melodrama's favor is that it manages to avoid the curse of tedium by saying what it has to in about an hour.Aside from the story's topical twist, \\"The Chicago Kid\\" is assembly-line adventure. For, in relating the tale of Joe Ferrill's quest for revenge for his late father's conviction for embezzlement and his metamorphosis from an honest, self-effacing bookkeeper to the ill-fated tough and affluent mob leader, the producers have telegraphed their punches. And, the odds are the audience will arrive at the denouement even more quickly than the scenarists. The square-jawed Donald Barry, familiar to devotees of the horse opera, plays Joe Ferrill with grim determination, while Otto Kruger, as the unwitting object of his hate, gives a restrained and commendable portrayal. Tom Powers (who was seen recently as the victim in \\"Double Indemnity\\"), Lynne Roberts and Chick Chandler, appear in the chief supporting roles.Need red points? Save waste fat.

After having listened to the silver tones of Beniamino Gigli and Giuseppi DeLuca, one's ear drums were jarred periodically by resounding threats, jeers and protestations in a ruddy melodrama, the first film subject to be presented with any great degree of dialogue. The vitaphone performed its task admirably, for it reproduced faithfully the sounds of the contrasting subjects, and the synchronization of the voices with the lips of the shadows images was excellent.The first part of this Vitaphone program is as good as anything that has been heard, especially the operatic stars and a violinist. Their efforts aroused genuine applause. Other subjects with dancing and orchestral music also delighted the audience. Messrs. Gigli and De Luca rendered a duet from \\"The Pearl Fishers.\\" Lighter offerings also won their way to the hearts of those in the packed theatre.Eventually the curtains parted and the silent screen announced the presentation of \\"Tenderloin,\\" which is, as one might anticipate, a crook story. It has its shadings, for you go from the muddy puddles of east side streets to silver-sheathed lakes in the country, from dingy hovels to flowered meadows. Then there is also always the entrancing presence of Dolores Costello, who impersonates Rose Shannon, a dancer. Miss Costello's gowns are rather beyond a dancing girl and Michael Curtiz, the director of this film, is determined that beauty shall have its place on the screen. Every possible angle of Miss Costello's face is beheld in the course of this contribution. She is seen in smiles and tears, and eventually there comes a scene where this Rose is persecuted by the artists of the Third Degree. This section of the film is the first that is accompanied by sound, so that after reading the melodramatic phrases in the subtitles, one is startled by the thundering voice of a sleuth trying to make our dainty heroine confess that she stole the bag containing $50,000. The other minions of the law join in brow-beating the girl, who, bless her heart, still sticks to her story, which happens to be the truth.Chuck, a notorious gangster, who wears well-cut clothes, is at first attracted to Rose by her beauty, but subsequently he learns to love her. All through the story, however, until the exceptionally artificial storm strikes the screen, there is a doubt in Chuck's mind as to whether Rose is not the possessor of the $50,000, which had been taken out of the bag and replaced by poker chips and newspapers. Chuck's colleagues suspect him, and they decide in their own way to make him pay the piper. So one comes to a sequence wherein Rose and the \\"Professor,\\" a lame, but immensely powerful man, are left alone in a country house. For this episode it was thought that the Vitaphone was necessary and therefore one again hears the blasts from the shadows on the screen.The \\"Professor\\" enters the room, locks the door, puts the key in his pocket, and then looks at Rose, who is in her prettiest negligé with her fair hair showered over her shoulders. The \\"Professor\\" thunders that he knows all about women and he virtually tells Rose that it is a case of the money or her life. Not having the money. Rose shrinks with fear, and the \\"Professor\\" approaches her with due respect for all the old melodramatic ideas. Rose pleads that if he knows all about women, he ought to let her alone, or something of the sort. It looks black for Rose, but suddenly the door is heard to smash and soon Chuck beats the portal to splinters and leaps to Rose's rescue. Ah, it is not too late!\\"I love her,\\" insists Chuck.Rose tells Chuck that she loves him, it being uttered according to the the most shrieking conception of movie subtitles. The villain chuckles at Chuck and the latter perceiving that this \\"Professor\\" is going to do something dangerous with a lamp promptly pulls the trigger of his revolver and for an instant the villain knows that his pursuit of the heroine is off—that he is a bleeding giant cowed by a few inches of cold steel. Suddenly the \\"Professor\\" seizes his opportunity and you know that there is something else to come, besides the solving of the mystery as to who took the money out of the bag.Thunder and lightening help out the dreadful night, and Rose finds it expedient for her to dash from the house and go back to her city room. Then there are further threats, this time from the other gangsters, and Rose changes her mind and decides to return to warn Chuck. The storm tears down trees and the flood makes its appearance. But believe it or not, Rose reaches her hero in time to save him!Conrad Nagel is hardly suited to the rôle of the gangster, Chuck. It was he, who incidentally did admirably as the hero in Sir James M. Barrio's \\"Quality Street.\\" Mitchell Lewis is capable as the \\"Professor,\\" but words such as he has to utter would destroy the value of any acting.It looks very much as if the title-writer had supplied the words for the actors, and it is therefore easy to appreciate the result. At any rate the spectators were moved to loud mirth during the spoken episodes of this lurid film.

Streetscapes: 19 East 54th Street","excerpt":"A Fire-Ravaged, 1900 Mansion Now Enmeshed in a Dispute"},{"year":"1960","title":"WHILE the basic conflict is intellectual in the new film, \\"Inherit the Wind\\"—freedom of inquiry clashes with the slavery of dogmatic thought—it is one that can be made dramatic in a straight confrontation of two men, one a tough, agile advocate of freedom and the other a stanch, shrewd supporter of the mental block. This is the triumph of the picture, which Stanley Kramer has made and which opened yesterday at the Astor and the redecorated Trans-Lux Eighty-fifth Street.For with a dramatic face-off between Spencer Tracy and Fredric March, the two unsurpassable actors persuaded to play the roles, Mr. Kramer has wonderfully accomplished not only a graphic fleshing of his theme but he also has got one of the most brilliant and engrossing displays of acting ever witnessed on the screen.It is not an unmentionable secret that the stage play, \\"Inherit the Wind,\\" of Jerome Lawrence and Robert E. Lee, upon which this picture is based, was a thinly disguised re-enactment of the famous trial of John T. Scopes—called the \\"monkey trial\\" by some newspapers—that took place in Dayton, Tenn., in 1925. Nor is it a point to be avoided that its principal courtroom antagonists were supposed to be Clarence Darrow, the defense attorney, and William Jennings Bryan.The latter is made more apparent, if not more explicit, in the film by Mr. March's extraordinary make-up and assumption of the mannerisms of Bryan. His fine simulation of a bald dome, a fringe of flowing hair and a way of tightening his lips and making gestures and nervous flutters with a palm-leaf fan are vividly recollective of the \\"silver-tongued orator\\" who made the air ring with his phrases in support of the fundamentalist interpretation of the Bible at the Dayton trial.But the accuracy of the resemblance is mainly a dividend for those who remember what Bryan looked like. The artistic virtue of it is that it gives a stunning comprehension of a proud, pompous, demagogic man, full of dogmatic assertion and theatrical flourishes who stands serenely encircled by ignorance until the locks of his own mind are forced.As the man who accomplishes this forcing, by dint of his intelligence, tenacity, patience, inspiration and adroitness at verbal argument, Mr. Tracy does not endeavor to do a resemblance to Darrow, but he gives a fine, forceful simulation of a strong, home-spun advocate of good sense. He is, of course, the lawyer who defends the young schoolteacher charged with violating the state law forbidding the teaching of Darwin's theory of evolution.As courtroom antagonists, Mr. Tracy and Mr. March strike continuous sparks that fall into the highly volatile tinder of surroundings that richly represent a community of generally ignorant, bigoted people supercharged with emotion over the trial. All of this, too, is re-created by Mr. Kramer with colorfulness and clarity, so that humor as well as grass-roots toughness is piled with insensitivity.Conspicuous in the surroundings are assorted small-town types and several characters closely related to the principals. There is the young man on trial, a hayseed hero, played stalwartly by Dick York","excerpt":"a fire-snorting fundamentalist minister, performed robustly by Claude Akins, and the latter's tormented daughter, played tautly by Donna Anderson. There's the wife of the fundamentalist lawyer, whom Florence Eldridge quietly makes a beautifully ladylike dispenser of compassion and loyalty, and there's a nimble newspaper reporter, played briskly and glibly by Gene Kelly.Some changes have been made by Nathan E. Douglas and Harold Jacob Smith in writing the play into a script. Some academic and theological points have been blunted, the carnival atmosphere of the trial pointed up. But the essential conflict of the principals is precisely what it was, and it grows in tempestuousness and tension until it is the big dramatic thing.When the two men come to their final showdown and the barrier of dogma is breached, it is a triumphant moment for human dignity—and for Mr. Tracy and Mr. March.

But Shigeko Suga Aguirre, a member of La Mama's Great Jones Repertory Company, proved that it can be done in a production of \\"Le Balcon\\" that was presented on Sunday night at La Mama's First Floor Theater (74A East 4th Street). \\"Le Balcon\\" will be performed again Thursday through Sunday nights at La Mama, with a cameo appearance by Lowell Smith of Dance Theater of Harlem.    Flamenco dance and music are skillfully woven into a text adapted from the play and spoken by two of the performers. Every bit of the stage space is used imaginatively. And the actors are persuasive, particularly La Constancia as the lusty brothel keeper and the most impressive of the flamenco dancers. But there at first seems to be more Brecht than Butoh in this provocative, mostly compelling adaptation, until Maria Alba enters the stage.

Mom, motion picture editor and critic of La Nacion of Buenos Aires. The locale of the tale is supposed to be an Argentine pleasure resort, but the out-of-doors scenes bear an unmistakable aspect of Hollywood's hills and dales. This production is quite a fair diversion, being tinged with originality in its development, but the dialogue writer panders too much to Mr. Schildkraut, who while he assumes an air of nonchalance as Carlos Manuel Rodriguez Lopez, a conceited violinist, frequently utters his lines in a recitative rather than a conversational manner.This film was directed by Walter Long and supervised by that motion picture veteran, James Cruze. Pictorially it is excellent, and although there is an imaginative use of sound, the effect is sometimes a little forced and the reproduction varies, being occasionally startling in tone. Mr. Schildkraut not only monopolizes the conversation but his voice comes forth from the screen much louder than is necessary.This egotistical musician, Carlos, happens to be driving down a hilly road when he notices a girl leap into the river. Without appearing much perturbed, he takes off his coat and goes to the rescue. He carries the frightened and speechless girl to his comfortable abode and when she recovers he refers cynically to her unsuccessful attempt at suicide, admonishing her that if she really wanted to end her life in an artistic fashion she ought to go to Inspiration Point, a couple of hundred feet above the sea. With these words, Carlos then changes his clothes and goes forth to his favorite café, where the director shows him to be a persuasive person with the fair sex, his conquests being attractive women who have tired of their husbands.In a section of the café set aside for gambling, Carlos hears of a man who, following his wife's suicide, inherits her insurance. This puts a bee in Carlos's bonnet and following several somewhat disappointing appointments with the wives of other men, he suggests to Narita, the girl he saved from drowning, that they try marriage for a year, each to be insured in the favor of the other. Carlos has the temerity to explain to the gloomy Narita that he is in need of financial assistance to carry on his musical studies.They, it is presumed, become husband and wife and, as agreed, Carlos pays little or no attention to Narita. He has several affairs with blondes and brunettes, but it never dawns on him that Narita, impersonated by Myrna Loy, is pretty. Her loyalty, however, is proven when she saves Carlos from a wild husband's bullet.Carlos then appears to become a little more considerate of Narita and one day the two go on a picnic, stopping at a place where there is a magnificent view. Narita asks the name of the spot and Carlos replies: \\"Inspiration Point.\\" Evidently Carlos has forgotten his suggestion regarding artistic suicide, for that evening he attacks and kills a man who associates Narita's name with a scandal.In prison Carlos no longer thinks of collecting his bride's insurance. He wants her love, and when he hears that she intends to commit suicide so that he will have enough money to help him to get off with a light sentence he uses his wits, escapes from jail and by some fortuitous circumstance succeeds in side-swiping Narita's car just when she is about to drive it over the cliff at Inspiration Point.The director has compassion on his audience and decides to dismiss his principal characters by letting it be known that Carlos is going to return to prison and hope for a brief period behind the bars.Miss Loy acts her part exceptionally well. She has a pleasing voice and she speaks her lines with spontaneity.There are several effective stage numbers on the program and also the Japanese players in a tragedy called \\"Love of the Cherry Blossom.\\" THE SCREEN","excerpt":"A Flippant Philanderer."},{"year":"1989","title":"LEAD: The Equity Library Theater's revival of the 1917 musical ''Leave It to Jane'' opens with a bang, as cheerleaders and athletes parade through the aisles drumming up support for the football team of the fictional Atwater College.

Gurney may be the last playwright who writes full time about that quaint old bird, the New England WASP. Maybe it's an unfashionable calling, but Mr. Gurney's view of his terrain is so objective that his plays often fill in the missing pieces of the fractured American social puzzle. When you meet the economically rarefied yet often emotionally disadvantaged characters in Gurney plays like \\"Love Letters\\" and \\"The Cocktail Hour,\\" you remember just why the rest of the country has spent 25 or so years fleeing in the opposite direction.   Austin, the Boston banker at the center of \\"Later Life,\\" Mr. Gurney's enjoyable new 80-minute comedy at Playwrights Horizons, is one of the playwright's saddest creations. (Or half-creations. In the Playbill, Mr. Gurney acknowledges a debt to Henry James, whose tale \\"The Beast in the Jungle\\" seems the play's point of departure.) A smart and genial preppie in late middle age, Austin rather resembles the President he voted for in the last election. He's likable and polite, and he puts in his time at the office, but what exactly is he doing with his life?

Andrea del Verrocchio's bronze \\"Christ and St. Thomas\\" should be familiar to anyone who has taken Art History 101, even after a dramatic cleaning by Florentine restorers who removed 500 years of accumulated grime.   If it were by Michelangelo, there would no doubt be lines stretching all the way from the museum's lobby to the Lehman wing, where \\"Christ and St. Thomas\\" is on view. But Verrocchio's reputation was long ago wounded by, who else, a critic: Giorgio Vasari, writing in 1550, almost three-quarters of a century after the unveiling of \\"Christ and St. Thomas,\\" described Verrocchio's art as \\"hard and crude, since it was the product of unremitting study rather than of any natural gift or facility.\\" Vasari's opinion has echoed through time so that now Verrocchio may be better known as the teacher of his studio assistant, Leonardo da Vinci, than for his own prodigious achievements. (When this exhibition was on view in Florence, it was titled, \\"The Teacher of Leonardo: The Restoration of 'The Doubting St. Thomas' by Andrea del Verrocchio\\"). Review/Art","excerpt":"A Florentine Sculptor's Masterpiece"},{"year":"1924","title":"With its constantly changing scene of wondrous beauty and players in medieval costumes who appear to belong to the life of yesteryear, the picturization of George Eliot's \\"Romola,\\" was presented last night before a brilliant gathering in the George M. Cohan Theatre. It mattered not that the narrative was unfolded with deliberation or that the villain held the stage more than the heroine or the hero, as the shadows were always stirring with their remarkable scenic effects, the artistic lighting and the obvious endeavor to have every little detail put forth with a careful reflection of past ages.This entrancing shadow story was produced in Italy, Florence being used as the background for the romance of Romola, the faithful and loving daughter of Bardo Bardi, the blind scholar, whose books singularly enough compensated him for the loss of his eyesight. Last night one saw him before his great hearth, Romola kneeling beside him and Carlo Bucellini (Ronald Colman) ever ready to do the bidding of the old man or the wistful maid.Lillian Gish plays the part of Romola, and her sister Dorothy is cast as Tessa, the humble daughter of a marketing woman. William H. Powell, who gained no little fame by a part he played in \\"The Bright Shawl,\\" figures as Tito Melema. He gives a splendid performance.Henry King, the director of \\"The White Sister,\\" was the guiding spirit of this new production. He has a style of his own, and his artistic bent is apparent in most of the glorious scenes of this film. The settings are really something to marvel at, and no less impressive are the exteriors. There are white, winding roadways flanked by sun-bleached stone walls, old gates that have stood the test of centuries of seasons, worm-eaten oaken doors, cobble-stone squares and a glimpse of a lazily flowing river. Mr. King used Florence for all it was worth in this picture, and even if the story were not as good as it is, the scenes are so beautiful that they in themselves are worth every instant one spends viewing this picture. At times the photography is of such excellence that it appears to have depth. There are views in the sunshine and others tinted for moonlight which would awaken enthusiasm in the eyes of any artist.Added to all this there is the presence of the graceful, restrained, thoughtful and spiritual Lillian Gish, who never appears to make a false move or a wrong expression during the many scenes in which she appears. Her sister Dorothy is of a different temperament, but she suits the part she fills in this film. She is boisterous, impulsive, credulous, but passionately devoted to Tito, the scoundrel who deceives the two girls and his father.In the opening scenes there are the ships with their men of brawn pulling with sharp, quick strokes on the great oars—the galley slaves. Tito is returning from Greece with his foster father when their vessel is attacked by pirates. The father urges Tito to leap into the water and swim ashore, so that the young man can sell the jewels and eventually rescue the old man. He has courage to plow his way through the calm water to safety, but Tito's eyes are ever ready to flash with affection upon a pretty Florentine maid. He, therefore, forgets about his old father, and pulls strings to get into politics.His sauve sympathy appeals to old Bardi, who in the end suggests that Tito wed his daughter. You see Bardi on his favorite chair, before the blazing fire with its cone-shaped chimney, inhaling a perfume from a flower he holds between his thumb and forefinger. Suddenly Romola lets fall a book and the irate father springs to his feet, quickly reminding the girl that the books mean everything to him. Tito promises that he will carry on the work of the old man, but, as usual, he finds it convenient to do otherwise. In the end he sells the precious books.There is a fine dramatic sequence where Romolo has been injured by the maddened mob and is taken to Tessa's stone dwelling. Tessa expects her husband, who is now clad as Carpaccio pictured the Venetian dandies—with doublet and hose, and slashed sleeves filled with blossoming varicolored silks. Romola does not know that the man who is the father of Tessa's baby, is also her own husband.Another thrilling chapter is where Baldassarre Calvo, Tito's foster father, reaches Florence as a weary, footsore tramp. Tito impudently denies that he knows the aged man, but finally when Baldassarre is brought into the banquet hall by Carlo, Tito asserts that the old man was a servant who imagined that he had been cheated out of his rightful possessions. The old man is livid with rage, and forthwith staggers to a shop where he purchases a knife with which to stab Tito. In the end, however, Baldassarre discovers Tito exhausted after escaping from the Florentines by plunging into the river. You see the hate in the eyes of the white-haired man as he takes Tito's head and holds it under the water to die.There are many heads in close-ups put forth on the screen that resemble paintings by old masters. The gowns worn by Lillian Gish make her look like some wistful beauty of the fifteenth century who had come to life through modern shadows.In some sequences this picture could be improved by a better assembling of the scenes, as at times one believes days have passed, when it finally transpires that it is only half an hour. The cutter has also permitted himself too much liberty in disposing of the action of one scene and shifting to another. We imagine that this will be remedied. This is a film to be remembered, and the gorgeous scenes will never be forgotten.

This may be so. Certainly, inhabitants of the liberal sanctuaries accustomed to being out of step with the rest of the country are asking themselves how many times in one life they will have to ponder moving to Canada. For now they are just pulling raincoats tight around their \\"Great Society counter-cultural McGovern-ik\\" T-shirts and poring over David McCullough's \\"Truman,\\" looking for nuggets that might help the First Boomer. President Clinton may be no liberal's idea of a liberal, but in the Damien-gone-respectable context of Newt Gingrich, even to the die-hards in Berkeley, Cambridge and New York, he must now look pretty good.    Is it churlish to note that many of the people who say they feel burdened by Big Government are in a position to be so because they, or their parents and grand-parents, were its principal beneficiaries? Collective memory is an Etch-a-Sketch, easily erased. Barely 60 years have passed since the Government's response to the Great Depression reshaped the American social compact, redistributing wealth and creating opportunities for the dispossessed and disenfranchised, or as the phrase of the time put it, \\"one third of the nation.\\" True, as liberal critics would point out, Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal missed a lot of people but it did put the \\"upward\\" back in mobility for millions of Americans.

Conover and I were friends from Montclair. Farmer was a kid from Atlantic City, a 17-year-old who mumbled so badly you could never be sure what he was saying. He was big and good-looking, but the first impression was that he wasn't too swift.

Groundbreaking for the dorm, at 155 West 60th Street, is scheduled for fall. The project will be financed by a $51.8 million bond issue by the New York State Dormitory Authority. The architects are Schuman Lichtenstein Claman & Efron of Manhattan.   Fordham had hoped to sell part of its Manhattan campus to the Kaskel family development concern, which would have built a 41-story luxury apartment building on the site. The $16.5 million from that sale would have lowered the annual cost of room and board to $6,500, from $8,900, it was estimated.

The Iraqi government itself did not join in the petition and the party of the interim prime minister, Ayad Allawi, gave oral assent rather than its signature to the document. President Bush said he hoped the elections would proceed on schedule.   A1    Insurgents in Iraq have settled on a gruesome tactic intended to destabilize and terrorize, focusing their efforts against the one thing that Americans have counted on as the linchpin of an exit strategy from the country: the new Iraqi security forces. American troops have discovered 32 bodies in the northern city of Mosul during the past two days.   A1    Nuclear Talks With Iran in Peril  Iran and its European partners struggled to salvage their agreement committing Tehran to freeze an important part of its nuclear program. The two sides were so far apart that their talks were put off until Monday. Hossein Mousavian, the chief Iranian negotiator, predicted a compromise would be reached and expressed optimism that the deal would hold.   A3    Help for Palestinian Candidate  Marwan Barghouti, left, a popular politician currently in an Israeli jail, agreed not to run for the presidency of the Palestinian Authority. Instead, Mr. Barghouti called on Palestinians to support Fatah's candidate, Mahmoud Abbas, who has already succeeded Yasir Arafat as chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization.   A8    Ukraine Candidates Negotiate  The two candidates claiming to be the president-elect of Ukraine met in the presence of international mediators and agreed to begin immediate negotiations to try to end their bitter stalemate, but no specific agenda or timetable for a solution was set. It is the first sign of an easing of the political tensions that the outgoing president has warned risked leading to civil war.   A9    Upsurge of Violence in Darfur  Sudanese authorities and their guerrilla enemies signed a preliminary peace agreement just two weeks ago, and a fresh upsurge of violence is already engulfing Darfur, with rebels sharply ratcheting up attacks, the government responding with heavy-handed retaliation and large patches of land turning into no-go areas for humanitarian relief.   A1    Devious Colombian Traffickers  Major drug traffickers in Colombia have been presenting themselves as leaders of the paramilitary movement, in an effort to qualify for the same lenient treatment they suspect the government may soon offer to longstanding paramilitary commanders to persuade them to disarm, including protection against extradition to the United States.

A10    Illegal Immigration in Arizona  More illegal immigrants were apprehended in Arizona during the last fiscal year than were caught in California, New Mexico and Texas combined, prompting some who worked for a more secure border to ask why strategies that are successful elsewhere have not worked along Arizona's border.   A10    Report on Airplane Safety  The Federal Aviation Administration's campaign to keep hazardous materials off airplanes has generated thousands of enforcement cases and tens of millions of dollars in civil penalties.

Edward Joseph Collins was, for example, somewhat of a Midwestern darling during the first half of this century. Program notes for the orchestra's concert on Sunday afternoon at Carnegie Hall tell us that between 1924 and 1941 the Chicago Symphony played three of Collins's piano concertos and two other orchestra pieces. The listener is indebted for the information, for Collins's name is absent from the most prominent reference books now in circulation.   One of these Chicago performances was of the \\"Tragic Overture,\\" a well-made bit of melodrama offered by the American Composers Orchestra under Dennis Russell Davies on Sunday. This tidy piece fights off every modernistic impulse while clutching Liszt and Wagner firmly to its breast. Yet the \\"Tragic Overture\\" celebrates more modern calamity than Romantic tragedy. Its dire mood wells up from the bottom of the orchestra: tubas, trombones, double basses. There are moaning half steps, nasty little snare drum figures and, at the end, a funeral march set against solemn drums.

PRODUCER -- Squier Knapp Dunn Communications    THE SCRIPT -- A man's voice: ''It's easy to forget how scary the whole thing was.'' A woman's voice: ''It was a real test for New York.'' A woman's voice: ''People were worried.'' Another woman's voice: ''It was a sad time.'' Another woman's voice: ''People didn't know if they were going to have a job.'' A man's voice: ''People didn't know what to expect next.''    The Rev. Floyd H. Flake of the Greater Allen Cathedral in Jamaica, Queens: ''We were in a fiscal crisis. New York City took a big hit.'' Mr. Bloomberg: ''I remember it was a very cold day when I gave my inaugural speech. My mother, she held the Bible when I got sworn in. The smoke was still coming out of the World Trade Center. Conventional wisdom was people were going to leave this city in droves.''    Former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani: ''He had to deal with a city that was going through one of its worst crises ever. And he established himself immediately as a strong and effective leader.'' A white woman: ''Mayor Bloomberg came in, balanced the budget, kept the city running.'' Another white woman: ''Little by little it just started to turn around.'' A black man: ''It's booming in our community now.'' A white man: ''I'm hiring people back. I'm buying new equipment.'' A white woman: ''I see the economy coming back. I think not only Manhattan has come back but all the boroughs have come back.'' A white man: ''Sometimes people forget as a city where we were.'' A white man: ''Mayor Bloomberg has led us through some pretty tough times.'' A white woman: ''Mayor Bloomberg has security and crime under control.'' A black girl: ''It's definitely safer.'' A Hispanic woman: ''He has good ideas for the future.''    Former Mayor Edward I. Koch: ''Crime is down. We have more jobs. We did good trusting him.'' A black woman: ''I think we really did the right thing in giving him a shot.''    ON THE SCREEN -- The spot opens with an image of the Brooklyn Bridge as somber piano music and police sirens are heard in the background. The screen slowly moves through various scenes: officers walking with their heads tilting down","excerpt":"a forlorn-looking woman standing in front of a shop; a flag on the side of a skyscraper; Mr. Bloomberg being sworn in before a huge flag, his mother holding the Bible upon which he is swearing. Mr. Bloomberg, dressed casually, speaks into the camera from a park bench shortly before the spot moves to Mr. Giuliani, in a suit and red tie. After a series of New York City street scenes -- children playing soccer in front of the Unisphere in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, workers constructing a house, children on swings -- the spot ends with a black screen and the tag line ''Mike Bloomberg: Leadership for Us.''    ACCURACY -- This spot is largely based on the statements of individuals portrayed as expressing opinions. Its verifiable facts are generally true: crime is down, many economic indicators are pointing upward and the city has come a long way since the grim period after the attacks. But his Democratic opponents will question how much credit he should get for all that, and whether the city has come as far as the mayor's surrogates featured in the commercial say it has -- especially in minority neighborhoods.    SCORECARD -- By harking to the days after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, this spot goes to the heart of what Mr. Bloomberg's aides say they believe is his most powerful argument: that he delivered the city from some of the worst days it has known. Whether it was wise to open his ad campaign with that theme will be known only on Election Day. Political references to Sept. 11 can be dangerous in general. This spot seems to stay within the bounds of taste, though those can be hard to predict given the deep emotions the attacks still evoke.

It helps that he's an overwhelming soloist, and on his first tune of the night, his elbows out, his hands swooping up and down the keyboard, he seemed omnivorous, an octopus engulfing the piano. Mr. Chestnut played as if he'd been storing up ideas for years, and he let loose salvos of double-handed figures, rushing torrents of notes and hammered phrases in the lower register. Stop-time sections allowed him to place crystalline melodies against silence, seemingly bending notes that hung for a moment only to plummet into the rush of his lines.

That's why Suez Canal Fish and Things is such a treasure.    Samak bil-salsah is, simply, fish in sauce, but Hassan Ibrahim's whole porgy baked in tomato sauce, Port Said-style, is anything but simple. The recipe is from Mr. Ibrahim's father, a fisherman in Egypt's main Mediterranean port, and the taste is a fortuitous midsea collision of cuisines: tomato, onion, garlic, parsley, dill and cumin with phantom notes of cinnamon, anise and eggplant. The tangy, salty sauce plays delicately off the fish itself, the sweet flesh of which falls from the (plentiful) bones. Not bad for $6.    Suez Canal Fish and Things, around the corner from the strip of Indian restaurants on Newark Avenue in Journal Square, is worth a visit for the atmosphere alone. Just about the only sit-down restaurant serving Jersey City's 10,000-plus Egyptian community, it has the cozy feel of a neighborhood hangout. Men spend the evening talking over glasses of hot sugared tea. The room gives one the impression of being inside a giant aquarium. An undersea scene is painted on the window, and the red neon crab and blue wavelets on the opposite wall bathe the place in faint purple.    Mr. Ibrahim has unofficially dropped the \\"and Things\\" from the establishment's name (though the sign outside hasn't changed) because he no longer serves the Things -- kofta kebabs, lamb chops, chicken -- the better to concentrate on fish.

At the nine-month mark, economic growth in the United States has not caught fire.

Boucot, a Parisian entertainer, is the chief figure in \\"Le Culte de Beauté,\\" a French language film now at the Eighth Street Playhouse. It is a moderately entertaining piece with several agreeable songs rendered by M. Boucot and Mlle. Lilly Zevaco. These chansons are quite well recorded, but parts of the dialogue are uneven to the ear. Also the movements of the players are often too fast, which may be due both to Leonce Perret's direction and to the players' lack of experience in performing before the camera.There are several engaging scenes of Juan les Pins, the Riviera resort, but some of the interiors are poorly lighted. M. Boucot is energetic in his rôle, which is that of Arthur Michoux, who runs what he pleases to call on Institut de Beauté on the Champ Elysees. His escapades in this comedy, which inherits its story from an operetta, by Christine and Berde, furnish a reasonable amount of Gallic fun. It is a case of a plain girl named Antonine, a cousin of Arthur's, being transformed through beauty treatments and clothes into a person so attractive that the specialist in improving feminine faces and figures himself becomes enamored of her, after scorning her appearance when she first arrives at his home, and setting her to work as a housekeeper.In the course of this tale, Arthur has reason to be concerned about his wife's infatuation for Hubert Fondragon through finding a suspiciously worded epistle. Mme Michoux, or Mada, as she is called, craftily outwits ??? husband by telling him that the note was written to Antonine, and later by getting that young woman and Hubert to pose as a married couple. This happens before Antonine's appearance undergoes the change.The amours in this film become somewhat complicated through Arthur's sudden fondness for Antonine, her own love for a young man named Roger Beautramel, while pretending to be married to Hubert, and Mada's weakness for Hubert.Mile. Zevaco does quite well as Antonine. Mme. Edith Mera is acceptable as Arthur's flirtatious wife. M. Berval figures as Hubert. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"A French Farce. Cub Reporter Takes the Bacon.

On Other Screens."},{"year":"1939","title":"It must be part of that old affinity between the Gaels and the Gauls that prompted the French to take Liam O'Flaherty's \\"Mr. Gilhooley\\" and call it \\"Last Desire,\\" to shift its scene from Dublin to Havre, to change its Larry Gilhooley and its Nelly Carroll into a Georges and a Marcelle and to linger, with Gallic-Gaelic melancholy, over the doom-ridden love of an embittered man in his fifties for the half-wanton, half-childish waif he met one night in the fog.But, if the French and the Irish are affinities, as affinities they sometimes have their quarrels. With no more knowledge of the novel than may be gleaned from the reviews it received in 1927 and no more knowledge of the film than comes from seeing it at the Belmont, we have no doubt the screen treatment is inferior to the book. It is slow of movement, repetitious of speech and too obviously impressionistic in its direction. Although Raimu and Jacqueline Delubac have played the principal roles excellently, neither has been provided opportunity for a fully rounded characterization.And it is character, far more than incident, on which \\"Last Desire\\" depends. O'Flaherty wrote of a man who sheltered a stray out of pity, enshrined her as the symbol of the tenderness life always had denied him and killed her out of passion and the realization of his own abasement and degradation when she refused to remain quiescent on her pedestal. Very little of that tragedy, except in the most superficial degree, has come through on the screen. It emerges as a macabre, shadowy drama of jealousy and fear, with a certain somnolent attraction which we can attribute to performance and to its director's conjuration of mood. We prefer to recall a more successful O'Flaherty film. You may have heard of it—\\"The Informer.\\"At the CinecittaAfter enjoying \\"Re di Danari\\" (Money King), the Capitani film released by the Esperia Corporation at the Cinecitta yesterday, patrons of Italian pictures will regret more than ever the untimely passing of Angelo Musco. Never was that excellent Sicilian comedian more amusing than in this swift-paced tale of the wealthy villager and his sister (the ponderous and highly competent Rosina Anselmi), who make their first trip to Rome for the purpose of \\"saving\\" their handsome nephew (Mario Pisu) from the consequences of an entanglement with a noble but impoverished family.Vanna Vanni is beautiful enough to explain any man's haste in capturing her before it is too late. If this young woman develops into a finished actress, she will rank among the finest flowers produced in the European film garden. Enrico Guazzoni, the director, has held the dialect to the necessary minimum, which makes things easier for Americans with only a book knowledge of Italian. In the midst of the hilarity there is an occasional note of seriousness as a reminder that even members of the \\"upper classes\\" are human.

The voices are poorly recorded in many instances, and several of the sequences are inadequately photographed.In this amateurish piece of work the players are given to reciting their lines and frequently the tale is muddled, which may be due partly to deletions. Huguette ex-Duflos, impersonator of the attractive blonde who narrowly escapes death at the hand of a mysterious assassin in the yellow room, has a habit of talking through her teeth, which is not especially helpful to this mystery yarn.Often a black cat creeps into the scenes. The blonde, Mlle. Stangerson, goes to the yellow room on the eve of her marriage, and soon one perceives a hand come from under a sofa and snatch a revolver. How the man happens to know that the weapon is there is part of the mystery of this tale. Mlle. Stangerson, who is all ears during some scenes, is singularly deaf when one would imagine that her hearing would be acute. The man crawls from under the sofa, walks a pace or two, but only when Marcel l'Herbier, the director, gives the signal does she turn and face the murderous-looking person. Her scream reminds one of a nightmare, for either the recording went wrong or Mlle, ex-Duflos lost her voice. It is the most disappointing scream in the annals of audible pictures.M. l'Herbier essays to give snatches of conversation from groups of persons, which is all very well as an idea, but in this type of story it is essential to hear what is being said.Marcel Vibert's portrayal of a great detective is fair, and Maxime Desjardins has his moments, but a great deal of the time he appears to be talking to an imaginary audience rather than to the other players.

That fact is clearly attested not only by the pre-war plot but also by the plainly pre-war character of the style and spirit of the film.For this is a lurid spy picture in which most of the intrigue goes on in the boudoir of a smiling seductress and in a shadowy Tangier cabaret. It is one of those espionage thrillers in which a Mata Hari weaves her evil spell over an apparently weak British Army officer only to have him turn out a counter-spy. And it is one of those compounds of clichés in which explosives are planted in a ship's coal and a Spanish dancer clacks important messages in code with her castanets.Viviane Romance is the dark-haired adventuress who tangles the skeins of men's lives, and she plays with that slumbrous, sliding cunning which seems peculiar to French coquettes. Erich von Stroheim is the frozen-visaged genius who runs the enemy spy-ring and Roger Duchesne (who looks a bit like George Brent) is the heroic British officer. There is a certain theatrical glitter to some of the lurid intrigue, and a faintly exotic flavor has been distilled by Fedor Ozep in this film.

This meandering comedy has its canny moments as a man named Hertel, the caretaker of a seedy pet cemetery in the desert, tries to avoid coming to terms with progress. Taking over Pet Heaven cemetery after the death of his father, he finds that it has become valuable property for real estate development.

The play languishes, drifting through monologues as the caretaker goes about his daily nonduties. Although \\"Dog Logic\\" has a wistful respect for more humane times, it is less of a play than it might have been. This is in contrast to Mr. Strelich's previous desert comedy, \\"Neon Psalms,\\" presented several seasons ago at the American Place.

Included are scenes of stirring welcomes in Ottawa, Toronto, Winnepeg and, of course, the welcome by President Truman at the National Airport in Washington","excerpt":"a frigid but colorful rodeo in Calgary and an Indian dance presented for the visitors at Vancouver Island's Thunderbird Park.In this full-scale and rounded record of the public appearances of the Princess and her spouse, there emerges an indication of the wearying nature of such a trip. Most impressive and touching, however, are the successive scenes of children turned out to greet the visitors, from the packed numbers in a stadium in Montreal to the handfuls of bundled-up youngsters standing cheerfully in the snow, waving their flags and singing, out in the Rockies and on the plains.The film was directed by David Bairstow, with Osmond H. Borradaile, veteran associate of the late Robert Flaherty on many pictures, as chief cameraman.Also on the program at the theatre is another interesting documentary film, \\"Invitation to Harvard,\\" which gives an excellent survey of the facilities, the life and the learning at the great American university in Cambridge, Mass.

For years research on these jets, also known as supersonic-combustion ramjets, has bubbled along in Federal research laboratories on a shoestring budget. Then three weeks ago the President's science adviser and the chief of research and development for the Air Force disclosed that they were ready to commit a half-billion dollars over the next three years to refinement of the engine technology, in hopes of developing a plane that could cross the country in 12 minutes and circle the globe in 90.   If the effort works, it could mark the most significant change in airplane design since the invention of the jet. Air Force officials say scramjets may make it possible for a plane to take off from an ordinary runway and quickly accelerate to Mach 12 or even Mach 25.

Directing an orchestra like the Philadelphia, the New York or the Chicago carries with it influence beyond the walls of the concert hall. Just as the names of cities often refer to orchestras, the names of conductors come to stand for a city's esthetic taste and style.   Here in Philadelphia, for the past 12 years, that style and taste have been embodied by Riccardo Muti, who expanded the musical traditions that Eugene Ormandy had defined during his 44-year tenure as music director of the Philadelphia Orchestra. Ormandy turned the Philadelphia into a virtuoso ensemble, giving it a robust sleekness, an unpretentious directness. Mr. Muti, who is leaving at the end of this season to devote his energy to opera (he has been director of La Scala in Milan, Italy, since 1986), has added a pointed and ardent lyricism to the orchestra's character. He will be replaced next season by a conductor with still different tastes, Wolfgang Sawallisch, but a gala concert on Wednesday night at the Academy of Music offered exceptional testimony to the impact Mr. Muti has had.

Here there is Alison Corning, the daughter of an unscrupulous Wall Street operator, who sets her cap at John Hawks, a young football player, and prevails upon him to enter her father's office instead of following his own ambition to become a gridiron coach.Hawks's experience in financial circles terminates when he has hot words with old Corning concerning the latter's business methods. The young man wastes no time in taking up a new vocation, that of a hijacker. The picturing of the scenes at sea and on land is sometimes quite interesting, but the dialogue is invariably most amateurish.The determined Alison in an early scene tells Hawks that she regrets having wasted a kiss on him and, more in contempt than in affection, Hawks takes her in his arms and embraces her, saying that it is a good-bye from a he-man-son-of-the West, which she had called him a moment or so before.It is not a case of the villain pursuing the heroine, but of the girl pursuing the bright young man, who has discovered that old man Corning's interests are not confined to stocks and bonds, for the latter is responsible for financing Big John's bootlegging activities. Hence the taking up of hijacking not only serves to help Hawkes keep the wolf from the door, but also to even up matters with Steve Corning.On the bad ship Corsair Hawks and his men disguise themselves in naval uniforms, and they make trouble for Big John and his zealous lieutenant, Fish Face. Now and again there are some ingenious melodramatic stunts in this film, such as signaling by the Morse code while typewriting and having Slim, who joins forces with Hawks, an expert at talking without moving his lips. Big John is a die-hard, when it comes to protecting his champagne and liquor, and toward the close of the hectic doings this bootlegger tries to trap Hawks by filling cases supposed to contain bottled goods with pineapple bombs. In this end he is, however, defeated, for Hawks, after being captured by Big John's men, is in turn rescued through the craftiness of one of his own band. And in this supposedly exciting turn of events Alison also figures, for she and a comic companion have swum out to the Corsair in defiance of Hawks's instructions.Fish Face pretends to be sympathetic with Slim's girl, but he decides that no good can come of her continuing to live and therefore shoots her. Slim is shot while he is warning the persons on the Corsair that the cases they have stolen from Big John's vessel are filled with pineapple bombs and another man goes to his death, weighted down by a case of whisky.The sea scenes are often quite effective bits of photography. Chester Morris gives a stern portrayal as Hawks. Fred Kohler makes Big John sufficiently brutal. Emmett Corrigan does well as Corning, but Alison Loyd is merely amusing. William Austin's comedy falls rather flat in this ruddy piratical affair.

Occasionally, but only too rarely, there peeps through its stolidity and triteness a suspicion of the author, which is like a gentle breeze in the hot sun. One setting of a London street corner is a strange mixture of Old Kent Road, Tite Street, Chelsea, a nebulous conception of Soho and New York's Bowery. The comedian, a good sort, impersonated by none other than the intrepid Tammany Young, looks 3,500 miles away from London, until you notice his white derby, the crowning cockney effect, which one would seldom see on such a type, except possibly at the race track.Throughout this narrative, as it is set forth on the screen, there are constant coincidental encounters which are brought about without any real studied suspense. Much of the acting is effective, but there are no few moments when the players are artificial and posed. Toward the end there is a scene in which Wilfred Desert, the artist, is supposed to stifle his unhappy emotion. Henry Victor, who figures in this part, goes to the pains to draw his chin up and down, but at one instant his eyes belie his depression with a cheerful glint. Strong men, in such circumstances, can usually hold themselves under control, without any boarding-school girl's idea of wabbly chins and wet eyes, especially in this case, as Desert had been paying court to his friend's wife.The cherry-lipped Barbara La Marr is seen as Fleur Forstye, and it is only fair to say that her performance is much more restrained than usual. She is coy and demure in many of the scenes, using her long-lashed eyes effectively whether it is to soften a scolding or to heighten a flirtatious interlude. She shakes her head to port, then to starboard, then draws it a bit astern and finally puts it forward.The home in which the Montes live, after Fleur's marriage, is large enough to be Buckingham Palace, and it is furnished according to the whims of a Lambeth charwoman who had won the Calcutta Sweepstake.The contrast to the life of the Montes and Desert is Tony and Victorine Bicket, respectively impersonated by Charles Mack and Flora Le Breton. They live in a lodging house, hoping some day to save enough money to go to Australia, a country in which \\"a man has a chance.\\" Tony works in a publisher's firm, and is discharged for stealing books, that Bill Hawkes (Tammany Young) sells on the quiet.There is the painting of the symbolic \\"White Monkey,\\" that eats the fruit and tosses away the rind, which is afterward bought by Michael Mont. The fickle Fleur is fascinated by Wilfred, and much interested when in a casual way the artist asks Victorine whether she will pose for him in the \\"altogether.\\"The painting, as one sees it in shadow form, does not resemble Victorine, yet her husband at once realizes that it is she. Tony suspects frightful things when Victorine, after the painting is exhibited, announces that she has enough money for them both to go to Australia.George Marion acquits himself with honors in the part of Fleur's father. Thomas Holding's portrayal of Michael Mont is effective. Flora Le Breton is pretty as the earnest and faithful Victorine.Phil Rosen, who directed this production, had no easy job in making this story. It emerges as an interesting effort which lacks distinction.

Beneath the surface calm, all is turbulence, as fate and the masterly hand of the playwright drive the characters to their shared catastrophe. Inspired by a true story, Garcia Lorca wrote of acts of violence that destroyed several families. As in Ibsen's \\"Peer Gynt,\\" a man steals a bride on her wedding day, but with Garcia Lorca the marriage thief pays the ultimate price.
