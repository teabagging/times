Unlike Paris, Madrid and Rome, New York City does not have the magnificent grand boulevards that invite sidewalk dining. New Yorkers need considerable ingenuity to carve cafes out of little corners of sidewalks and postage-stamp back lots.   Despite the difficulties of urban geography, more restaurants than ever are serving outdoors this year, the city's Department of Consumer Affairs reports. Moreover, on July 6, scores of leading restaurants plan to move serving tables onto the sidewalks and sell samples of their cuisine as part of an industry promotion called NY93.   All of the outdoor-dining settings in Manhattan described below are sufficiently removed from busy streets to avoid fumes and noise. (All prices cover a three-course meal, including tax and a 15 percent tip, but not drinks.) Some spots are more spacious than others, some more romantic. Yet all, in their own peculiar way, offer foliage-starved New Yorkers a tiny taste of the great outdoors.     AMERICAN FESTIVAL CAFE, 20 West 50th Street, Rockefeller Center, (212) 246-6699. One of three restaurants surrounding the winter skating rink in Rockefeller Center, American Festival Cafe occupies much of that space in summer with umbrellas, tables for 85 diners, and a bar. This is a special spot for breakfast, too.   The American-international menu includes sandwiches, salads, gazpacho, summer pastas, steamer clams, grilled chicken, fried calamari and fried chicken. Dinner is about $20 to $30 a person.   BARBETTA, 321 West 46th Street, (212) 246-9171. Midtown's most majestic outdoor cafe can be found at this turn-of-the-century town house restaurant. While in recent years Barbetta has rarely been known for exceptional food, it is better now than it has been in some time.   One enters the town house and passes a long bar before reaching the grand dining room, which has an 18th-century Piedmontese crystal chandelier, silk drapes and chairs upholstered in brocade. Outside is a large, leafy garden with trees, flowers and sculptures. It is a wonderful place to linger on a sunny afternoon. Among the better dishes are charcoal-grilled squab with cranberry beans, grilled baby chicken, rack of veal and sundry risotti. Dinner is about $45 a person.   BAROLO, 398 West Broadway, between Spring and Broome Streets, SoHo, (212) 226-1102. One of the prettier and more spacious outdoor gardens downtown can be found at this colorful northern Italian restaurant. Behind the two main dining rooms, far from the street fumes and racket, is a walled-in garden seating 90 with spotlighted trees, terra-cotta floors and a balcony. The sizable dining rooms have sponged yellow walls and dark green banquettes.   The food was uneven on recent visits, and pastas seem to be the strong cards. Simple roasted or sauteed fish are generally done well, too. Dinner is about $35 a person.   CAFE, 210 Spring Street, SoHo, (212) 274-0505. This is an al fresco spot for night owls, a diverting place to stop after the movies for a brandy or cappuccino. Cafe is owned by Richard Widmaier-Picasso, a grandson of the artist. The crowd can be relentlessly trendy.   The main dining room and bar is casually Parisian, with rattan chairs, a marble floor, and dim lighting. In warm weather, a narrow porch is converted to an outdoor cafe that holds about a dozen tables. It is far enough from the Avenue of the Americas to avoid the automobile and bus fumes and the noise.   The straightforward bistro fare is generally satisfying: leeks vinaigrette, curly chicory with bacon and Roquefort, steak au poivre, roast chicken, roasted salmon with thyme, and rack of lamb. Dinner is about $35 to $40 a person.   IL CASALONE, 1675 Third Avenue, near 93d Street, (212) 369-1944. This attractive addition to the northern reaches of the Upper East Side is a beguiling spot with a rustic look: stone and stucco walls, wood-beam ceiling, wood-fired ovens. In the back is a big glass-enclosed stucco-and-wood porch overlooking a grass commons shared by several apartment buildings. In clement weather, the glass is removed to create a delightful outdoor cafe.   The food is not memorable, but there are enough worthy dishes to merit a visit: the colorful and well-seasoned grilled vegetable plate, a salad of goat cheese and roasted peppers, and various soups of the day. Pastas are uneven, though. Penne with eggplant, tomato, mozzarella and basil is a safe bet, as is the orecchiette tossed with broccoli and spicy sausages. Dinner is about $25 to $35 a person.   GASCOGNE, 158 Eighth Avenue, between 17th and 18th Streets, Chelsea, (212) 675-6564. The lusty cooking of Gascony, the rugged French province of foie gras, confit, game and Armagnac, is the specialty of this enchanting little spot. Gascogne has a farmhouse look, with rough sandstone walls, partly exposed brick and an attractive walled garden in the back.   Foie gras is a specialty, of course, either in a lusty terrine or sauteed with basil, artichokes and roasted garlic. Other good dishes include sauteed lamb in a garlic crust with tarragon, loin of rabbit wrapped in pancetta, and fillet of beef with black peppercorn and Armagnac sauce. Dinner is about $35 a person.   LION'S ROCK, 316 East 77th Street, (212) 988-3610. A giant granite rock behind this upbeat bar and restaurant prompted the establishment's name. The owners took advantage of this geological oddity to create an unusual outdoor cafe ringed by flowers. At sundown, the indoor lights are dimmed and the rock is illuminated, creating a dramatic backdrop.   Lion's Rock has an unpretentious, wholesome menu. This spring, the owner, Frank Visakay, decided to lower all prices by 40 percent to improve business. The American and international fare is simple and usually satisfying: skewered shrimp with peanut sauce, calf's liver with onions and bacon, grilled lamb chops with garlic mashed potatoes, and penne with basil, smoked mozzarella and Parmesan. Dinner is about $25 a person.   LE MADRI, 168 West 18th Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-8022. Some of the more innovative and enticing northern Italian fare in New York City can be found at the rustic-looking restaurant. Le Madri has a large main dining room with pale yellow walls, a vaulted ceiling supported by columns, a fabulous tiled wood-burning pizza oven and well-spaced tables. Outside is a recently renovated 50-seat outdoor patio enclosed by a wooden trellis where diners sit under wide umbrellas. It is always a lively spot at this time of year.   Regional Italian specialties on the menu include panzotti (oversized ravioli) stuffed with ricotta and spinach, glossed with butter and garnished with pine nuts","excerpt":"calf's liver with balsamic vinegar and onion compote, and baby chicken roasted in the wood-burning oven. Dinner is about $40 a person.   MIRACLE GRILL, 112 First Avenue, near Seventh Street, East Village, (212) 254-2353. This neighborhood is replete with so-called outdoor cafes, which often are nothing more than a few tables set out on the busy sidewalk. Miracle Grill, a rugged-looking spot serving some zesty Southwestern fare, has both an outdoor terrace and a pretty garden with an ivy-covered wall, pathways, shade trees and flower beds.   Terrific margaritas go down too smoothly, so have some food nearby. Among the recommended dishes are quesadillas filled with corn, zucchini, chilies and cheese; black bean soup with cilantro cream; grilled swordfish with a mango-and-black-bean salsa, and the Yucatan chicken fajita with black beans, onions, guacamole and sour cream. Dinner is about $25 a person.   LA PETITE FERME, 973 Lexington Avenue, at 71st Street, (212) 249-3272. Natural wood, dried flowers, and antiques contribute to the romantic farmhouse feeling here. Behind the restaurant is a cozy brick patio holding a half-dozen tables. It's a delightful spot, hidden from neighbors by a tall fence and spiraling foliage.   The bistro fare is generally satisfying here, including salade nicoise, grilled squid and mache, flank steak with ginger sauce, and more. Dinner is $35 to $40 a person.   PIETRO AND VANESSA, 23 Cleveland Place, near Lafayette Street, SoHo, (212) 941-0286. This offbeat spot does not engender confidence with its plastic stained-glass ceiling lights, a faux-brick bar and dime-store art, yet the Italian food is acceptable, sometimes better. Moreover, the friendly staff and the unhurried pace give the place a warm feeling.   The spacious 100-seat outdoor cafe has long tables and folding chairs and is framed by the backs of buildings, with no greenery to soften the look. At least there is plenty of open space to allow sunshine, and you are far from street noise.   Among the better dishes are chicken with mozzarella, porcini and tomatoes; capellini with pesto; linguine with clam sauce, and fried calamari. Dinner is about $25 a person.   PROVENCE, 38 Macdougal Street, SoHo, (212) 475-7500. The scents and tastes of Provence are wonderfully evoked at this popular bistro. Right now, a small but alluring outdoor patio is open. It is protected from the elements by a blue-and-white striped tent and has a flower-ringed fountain in the center.   A nice starter is pissaladiere, an onion-and-anchovy tart. Another evocative winner is the Provencal fish soup with spicy rouille. Among main courses to consider are the pan-roasted lamb with ratatouille, braised rabbit with fava beans, and roasted monkfish with saffron sauce. Dinner is about $40 a person.   RAPHAEL, 33 West 54th Street, (212) 582-8993. Restaurant Raphael remains one of the hidden jewels of midtown Manhattan, both for its superior country-French cooking and for its enchanting outdoor cafe. Since 1991, the chef has been Jean-Michel Bergougnoux, who ran the three-star kitchen at Le Cygne until it closed. His Provencal-inspired menu offers many temptations: confit of eggplant and lamb with warm goat cheese, grilled fresh sardines with basil, roasted skate with capers and a warm salad of winter greens, and a risotto with braised veal perfumed with star anise and cilantro. Dinner is about $50 a person.   LE REFUGE, 166 East 82d Street, (212) 861-4505. This enchanting little French auberge in the middle of the Upper East Side rates a 9 or greater on the romantic scale. The dining room has a creaky old charm with lots of aged wood, a beamed ceiling and antiques. The back dining room has brick walls and soft candlelight. At this time of year, a backyard patio, enclosed by a white picket fence, holds five tables.   The traditional French menu includes such winning dishes as buttery lobster ravioli, salad of arugula and goat cheese, well-cooked shrimp over couscous with tomato compote, and lamb stuffed with spinach and accompanied by a soothing potato gratin. Dinner is about $40 a person.   THE SEA GRILL, 19 West 49th Street, Rockefeller Center, (212) 246-9201. This sophisticated and stylish cousin to the casual American Festival Cafe shares the same outdoor area, with 70 umbrella-shaded seats. Seafood is the specialty, of course, and the menu carries everything from simple, light salads to more elaborate fare. Not every creation hits its target, but the batting average is high. The restaurant has an excellent American wine list with fair prices. Dinner is $35 to $50 a person.   TATOU, 151 East 50th Street, (212) 753-1144. This week, this worthy American restaurant and nightclub is to open a 40-seat outdoor dining area on the sidewalk far enough back to avoid fumes. Inside, the soaring dining room resembles a turn-of-the-century vaudeville house. Entertainment is provided nightly.   The menu is replete with assertive and homey American fare: roasted-corn chowder with corn-stick croutons, roasted vegetable tart with yellow-pepper coulis, pan-roasted halibut with a crust of crab meat and potatoes, and roasted salmon coated with honey mustard. Dinner is about $40 a person.   VONG, 200 East 54th Street, (212) 486-9592. This exotic and wildly popular Southeast Asian restaurant has recently opened an outside patio comfortably removed from busy Third Avenue. Jean-Georges Vongerichten, the chef and owner, serves a limited but enticing menu, essentially a sampling of the indoor food.   Among the dishes are a crab spring roll with tamarind dipping sauce, green papaya salad with cashews, lobster with shiitake and mustard greens over rice, and grilled beef in ginger broth. Appetizers run $8 to $12, main courses $16 to $20. A daily prix-fixe menu, including dessert, is $25.   Dining Spots That Promise A Taste of the Great Outdoors"},{"year":"1989","title":"LEAD: John R.

Bush administration officials said they would confront France, Germany and other skeptics of military action against Iraq by demanding that they publicly agree that Iraq had defied the Security Council. The officials said they were debating whether to seek a second U.N. resolution authorizing force against Iraq.   A1    In a blunt rejection of American impatience toward Baghdad, the leaders of France and Germany said they shared common views on Iraq and advised that any Security Council resolution for military action would have to await the report of weapons inspectors.   A10    Iraqis seem increasingly offended by the inspections, and the government appears to be encouraging public complaints about them, even as its officials agreed this week to expand cooperation with the U.N.   A10    Members of the Saudi royal family and advisers to Crown Prince Abdullah say chaos from the breakdown of the existing order in Iraq has become an overarching fear. The prince is said to be trying to persuade President Bush to go along with a strategy in which a decision to go to war is followed by a pause for intensive diplomacy to remove Saddam Hussein.   A1    Israeli Labor Party Behind  Polls show that the Labor Party's candidate for prime minister, Amram Mitzna, holds positions that are extremely popular. Yet the polls indicate that Labor is headed for a drubbing in elections. The party that built Israel may slip below 20 seats in the 120-seat Parliament.   A3    North Korea's Weapons Claim  North Korea said it had no intention of producing nuclear weapons, making the pledge to South Korea in high-level talks in which both sides appeared to be playing to different audiences.

A5    NATIONAL   A14-23    Housing Funds Planned For Religious Groups  The Bush administration is planning to allow religious groups for the first time to use federal housing money to help build facilities where religious worship takes place, as long as part of the building is also used for social services.   A1    U.S. Retracts Health Policy  The Bush administration said it was rescinding a new policy that allowed managed care organizations to limit coverage of emergency services for poor people on Medicaid.   A14    Inquiry Into Pelican Deaths  Federal officials are investigating the deaths in California of several brown pelicans that appear to have been purposely killed, despite belonging to a federally protected endangered species.   A14    A New Cabinet Secretary  The Senate unanimously confirmed Tom Ridge as the nation's first secretary of homeland security, with Democrats and Republicans alike heaping praise on Mr. Ridge even as they warned that his huge new department faced a daunting responsibility to prevent terrorist attacks on American soil.   A13    Bush Backs Abortion Protests  President Bush told tens of thousands of abortion protesters that he shared their commitment to ''protect the lives of innocent children waiting to be born,'' and asserted that the anti-abortion movement was gaining steam in Congress and the culture at large.   A16    Vote on Clean Air Rules  Voting along regional and party lines, the Republican-controlled Senate rejected an attempt to delay new pollution rules that many Democrats say will roll back clean air standards and endanger human health.

B1    School Integration Agreement  Seven years after Connecticut's highest court ordered the state to end racial disparities in Hartford's overwhelmingly black and Hispanic schools, state officials settled on a $245 million integration plan that civil-rights lawyers representing the students called a historic, if incomplete, step to reforming the city's impoverished education system.   B5    Deadly Mob Saga Detailed  In 1987, an imprisoned crime boss ordered the killing of a former mob prosecutor. But a pair of hitmen killed his father by mistake, prosecutors said in a sweeping indictment. And that was the start of a long mob saga with an escalating body count.
