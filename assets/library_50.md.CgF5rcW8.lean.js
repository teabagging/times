The comedians deliver their pleasantries with rapid-fire precision, sometimes with unwarranted enthusiasm. Meanwhile, the hotel they are supposed to be managing is turned into a shambles by the machine guns of two rival gangs, both seeking the jewels and other booty lying about loose.The humor of the acidulous Mr. Woolsey and his naïve partner smacks of the five-a-day circuits. When the seductive blonde, one of the crooks, announces that she is going to seek repose in the arms of Morpheus, Mr. Wheeler warns the house detective to watch out for Morpheus. Informed that one of the guests is a veritable dynamo, he responds, \\"Yeah, he charged all his meals.\\" Mr. Wheeler also has his innings. When he is ordered to show a suspicious-looking guest to his room he replies, \\"I'll show him up!\\" Later he adds, \\"He must be a big shot,\\" At that moment the guest's suitcase falls apart and a machine gun rolls out.The supporting players perform capably in their farce rôles, their chief duty being to provide foils for the two comedians.

Mr. Gades's live dance version of ''Blood Wedding'' had its own New York premiere with Alicia Alonso's National Ballet of Cuba in 1978 and in that theatrical presentation, it was deservedly a success.   The surprise then is how different, even fairly unfamiliar, this ballet looks in the film, where Mr. Saura obviously has had the upper hand. Performed in a simulated dress rehearsal but shorn of its conventional stage sets, this studio presentation is like a photographic negative, with the print - the full production - still to be developed.   That, at least, is how this ''Blood Wedding'' appears when one recalls the details of its stage version at the Metropolitan Opera House.

When an outraged Sam peeks into Diane's diary from 1976, she learns that her father might not be Samuel Mayerofsky, whose photograph she worships and who died in a motorcycle accident before Sam was born. It seems there are two other paternal candidates she has never heard of. She writes to both men. In true fantasy fashion, the post office and good fortune both work to her advantage, and she finds them.

That's the part of the job, a major part, that is abhorred by guidance counselors who care. The Cobra lurks in many strengths even as seniors apply to ''easier'' colleges. In today's competitive college jungle, the Cobra is biting deeper than ever. What to do? We will never kill the Cobra; forget it. As long as the old-boy or old-girl network stays in business, or we think it does; as long as some newspapers publish annual roundups of Ivy League admissions; as long as some schools suddenly get hot; as long as we equate exclusivity with quality, the Cobra is right there. The idea, then, is to keep him confused, off balance, outside the arena. That's not easy, and we don't always succeed, but let me tell you how one counselor fights the Cobra by what he tells his students.

The director's ability to sustain this device at length amounts to an interesting feat of gamesmanship, and works more successfully than may sound possible. But the trick has the inherent problems of being frustratingly superficial and of leaving the film in a twilight realm of quasi fiction. Miss Ottarsdottir, in using this method to create an overview of life in the Faroese capital of Torshavn, winds up revealing very little that could not be dealt with more easily and accurately in a documentary format. The idea of using nonactors to deliver fictionalized but mundane-sounding dialogue becomes similarly distracting.

It was a warm autumn day a year after he'd lost the Presidency to Bill Clinton, and I had come to see how he was doing -- how a reversal of such magnitude had affected someone as competitive as Bush. When I wrote and asked if I could come and talk to him about this I was quite prepared to be turned down. There had been hardly a word about him in the newspapers since the election. Obviously he was keeping a low profile. To my surprise, he had written back and said he'd be delighted to see me. But there were conditions. No discussion of politics. Absolutely none. Indeed, just before I left for my appointment with him, his secretary called to remind me of this.\\n\\nI took the elevator up to the ninth floor. In the President's outer office, I was told he was taping a tribute to Ted Williams, the baseball star. A retired volunteer, Jack Steel, appeared and offered to show me some of the items stored in various office rooms and awaiting the completion of the Bush Presidential Library and Museum on the grounds of Texas A & M University. The most impressive of these was a large structure called \\"The Gate of Kuwait,\\" which took up most of an empty room. Given to the President during his visit there in the spring of 1993, it stands well over six feet. A series of gold plaques listing the names of the United States soldiers lost in the Persian Gulf war outlines a small door more than 100 years old.

Blayney, a McLean, Va., financial planner, has a client with a problem: he needs to come up with $250,000 in 45 days to pay for a piece of raw land that he bought at a bankruptcy auction. Undeveloped land is often difficult to finance, particularly on such short notice. But Ms. Blayney has a solution: using a private banker. The client's financial background is strong enough to meet the banker's guidelines, Ms. Blayney said, and a check should be available in a matter of days. \\n\\nGetting loans quickly and with a minimum of red tape is perhaps the most useful service provided by private banking departments, which exist at most commercial banks and some savings banks. At their most elaborate, the departments are designed to pull all the disparate resources of a bank together in one place to help clients with all of their financial needs. In return for being assigned to a specific banker and given access to a range of financial experts, the client is expected to generate a certain amount of business or pay a minimum annual fee.

(Perennial/HarperCollins, $12.95.) In the summer of 1999, two friends from the Boston area wandered into sun-blasted Carlsbad Caverns National Park with three pints of water between them and got lost","excerpt":"when a ranger found them four days later, one was badly dehydrated, the other stabbed to death by his friend. The mystery is why he was killed. This ''ruminative, wholly absorbing'' account unfolds with ''quiet authority, lending unexpected dignity to the whole affair,'' our reviewer, Bruce Barcott, wrote in the Book Review last year.    THE GREAT WAVE: Gilded Age Misfits, Japanese Eccentrics, and the Opening of Old Japan, by Christopher Benfey. (Random House, $14.95.) In the years after Commodore Perry hit the shores of Japan in 1853, new perceptions took hold among American and Japanese artists, thinkers and writers, a cultural give-and-take that still echoes today. Benfey ''brings to his subject a scholar's thoroughness, a critic's astuteness and a storyteller's sense of drama,'' William Deresiewicz said here in 2003. The result is a ''symphony not only of characters but of ideas.''    EARLY OCCULT MEMORY SYSTEMS OF THE LOWER MIDWEST, by B. H. Fairchild. (Norton, $13.95.) Winner of a National Book Critics Circle Award, this collection of poetry resonates with loneliness as it conjures history writ large and small in the plains and small towns of the Midwest. The poems display ''the American voice at its best: confident and conflicted, celebratory and melancholic,'' Michael Hainey wrote in these pages last year.    LIARS AND SAINTS, by Maile Meloy. (Scribner, $13.) In this first novel, the fortunes of four generations of a Roman Catholic family in Southern California are wrapped up in a family secret: the matriarch tries to conceal the unwanted pregnancy of her teenage daughter by pretending the baby is actually hers, a ruse that requires delicate planning, to say the least. The result is a ''spectacular'' book that ''explores religion and faith from nearly every possible angle, with equal empathy for the faithful and doubting alike,'' Sara Mosle said here in 2003.    THE PRINCE OF PROVIDENCE: The Rise and Fall of Buddy Cianci, America's Most Notorious Mayor, by Mike Stanton. (Random House, $14.95.) Coarse, profane and funny (often at the same time), the larger-than-life Cianci lorded over Providence, R.I., for more than 20 years, running a brazen criminal enterprise of kickbacks, shakedowns and threats before landing in jail in 2002. Last year our reviewer, Clyde Haberman, found this a flawed account, but one with ''impressive'' reportage and ''great yarns.''    THE HILLS AT HOME, by Nancy Clark. (Anchor, $14.95.) This first novel, about an extended WASP family gathered under the roof of a rambling, 200-year-old clapboard home in New England, is filled with the haphazard encounters that make up domestic life and the inflections of opinionated people who share meals, territory and belongings with uneasy familiarity. Clark's ''graceful, intelligent and very funny'' book ''reminds us that the tribe has not vanished, and that we're all members of it,'' Roxana Robinson said in these pages in 2003. It ''succeeds brilliantly'' in its ''revelation of a particular kind of life.''    A HOLE IN THE HEART, by Christopher Marquis. (St. Martin's Griffin, $13.95.) Bean Jessup, the frumpy protagonist of this first novel by a Times correspondent, opens up to the beauty of Alaska when she falls in love and marries a carpenter in a fishing town; after disaster strikes, she perseveres with the help of her husband's kleptomaniac mother and the two head to San Francisco, and a new life. The message? ''Loving good people and losing them: that's life,'' Bruce Barcott wrote here in 2003.    THE LANDSCAPE OF HISTORY: How Historians Map the Past, by John Lewis Gaddis. (Oxford University, $13.95.) Drawing on a series of lectures he gave at Oxford, a Yale professor explores the relationship between science and history.

Very often it is not the cloud that causes the turbulence but the turbulence that causes the cloud. The clouds most associated with turbulent air are cumulus and its offspring, the cumulonimbus or thunderhead. Cumulus clouds, seen mostly in fair weather, are large, fluffy, flat-bottomed and about as high as they are wide. The cumulus is only the visible part of a rising convection current that occurs when the ground, warmed by the sun, in turn warms the air at ground level. The bottom of the cloud marks the altitude at which the rising air has been sufficiently cooled to make water vapor in the air condense into cloud. Such a convection system is full of turbulence, just as a pot of hot water is before it boils","excerpt":"when air goes up, other air must go down.

Enter the spacious offices on North Main Street here and turn to your left. A skull, with one empty eye socket and the other holding a bulging bloody eye, greets you.\\n\\nOn your right sits a life-size replica of Freddie Krueger, the killer character from the \\"Nightmare on Elm Street\\" movies, replete with hideously scarred face and knife-blade fingertips. Straight ahead lies a black coffin, lined with purple silk, and in it, a skeleton dressed in a pinstripe suit and paisley tie. \\n\\n\\"This coffin we made ourselves, but we can also buy real ones, damaged, from a casket company,\\" explained Les Benjamin, owner of Westchester Party Design.\\n\\nHappy Halloween.\\n\\nOctober is a big month for people in the party-decorating business, and, Mr. Benjamin said, it is getting bigger every year. In the last decade or so, Halloween has begun to rival Christmas with its generally festive atmosphere. This weekend, Mr. Benjamin provided spooky decorations for two country club dinner dances and two private parties. The one-eyed skull, the skeletal corpse and Freddie Kruger will all be on view at someone's home, along with goblets emitting swirls of mist (dry ice) and candle-lighted pumpkins of all sizes and shapes.\\n\\nNor is the upcoming holiday the only occasion for autumn celebrations. The entire fall season has become \\"like one big beautiful harvest festival,\\" Mr. Benjamin said. No longer content to wait for December's boughs of holly, corporations deck their halls with cornstalks, gourds and pumpkins. October's jack-o'-lanterns and ghosts yield to November's turkeys and Pilgrim figures, but the backdrop of gold, russet and scarlet remains until Dec. 1.\\n\\n\\"We maintain fall colors from September through the end of November,\\" Mr. Benjamin said. \\"Fall has become a 12-week phenomenon, and Halloween is one of its peak holidays. For some reason -- maybe because they liked partying or have memories of glitter rock of the 70's -- the baby boomer generation has made it into a very big event.\\"\\n\\nAs for his own Halloween, the 52-year-old Mr. Benjamin gives neighborhood kids a treat -- and a trick at his Harrison home. He and his wife, Suzanne, festoon the place with spider webbing (synthetic, drawn from a roll). Then Mr. Benjamin dresses himself as a scarecrow and lies back in a reclining chair, a bowl of candy tucked under one arm, with a sign reading \\"Take one.\\" He closes his eyes as if asleep","excerpt":"when an unsuspecting youngster takes two or more treats, he jolts awake and growls, \\"I told you, Take one.\\" \\n\\n\\"They love these tricks,\\" he said. \\"I love children -- I'm a kid at heart myself. The business I'm in is a fun business.\\" \\n\\nIt wasn't always that way. Mr. Benjamin studied international law at Pennsylvania Military College, then went into the jewelry field, trading gold bullion. One day he decided to do something different and, in the mid-1970's, bought a button-making machine, which could laminate photos for people to wear in a matter of minutes. The next step was cotton candy, then balloons and games of chance, and before he knew it, he was renting out little carnivals for all sorts of children's events. \\n\\nWord-of-mouth soon led to the expansion of the business into decorations for teen-age and adult parties. Mr. Benjamin added fresh floral centerpieces to his selections and began doing theme parties, including bar mitzvahs, sweet 16's and corporate and private galas. Among his corporate clients in Westchester are International Business Machines, Texaco and Kraft General Foods. The Lighthouse is one of his nonprofit clients.\\n\\nHis workshop is filled with ribbons, sequins, shiny lame fabric and dozens of other items to use in making centerpieces, buffet table pieces and freestanding displays. There are four-foot-high mermaids, painted in vivid colors and cut out of plastic foam, for an under-the-sea theme bar mitzvah; centerpieces with movie projector reels, shiny silver fronds and boxes of popcorn for a cinema buff; glittery wire-basketball-player figures for a sports lover. He made giant wishbones of foam for a benefit for the Make-a-Wish Foundation for terminally ill children; for a recent gala celebrating the opening of a new laboratory at the County Medical Center, he and his staff created centerpieces using glass test tubes and foam cutouts modeled on the DNA symbol.\\n\\n\\"You start with a basic idea and then you brainstorm,\\" he explained. You get as creative as you can.\\n\\nHalloween presents a particular challenge. While the holiday is generally upbeat now, its origins as a pre-Christian feast commemorating spirits of the dead are not all that far from the surface. The American Book of Days says that the Celtic year ended on Oct. 31 -- \\"the eve of Samhain -- and on this occasion priests celebrated a joint festival for the Sun God and the Lord of the Dead.\\" \\n\\nMany years later, in Scotland, Wales and Ireland, country people lighted bonfires to disperse spirits they believed were out haunting the hills and carried out hollowed-out potatoes illuminated by candles placed within: a precursor to today's jack-o'-lanterns. The association of Halloween with death and evil spirits is one Mr. Benjamin prefers to play down a bit.\\n\\n\\"Unless someone specifically requests it -- as the host of one of the private parties of this weekend did -- we don't go too heavy on the gore and ghosts,\\" he said. \\"We've seen people actually get frightened by certain special effects. For example, I once put on some very professional makeup so that my face looked like it was mutilated. My wife said, 'Take it off -- you can't go out like that, it may be too close to someone's tragic reality.' \\"\\n\\nTo keep things on the lighter side for one of his country club parties this year, Mr. Benjamin created a smiling jack-o'-lantern centerpiece, surrounded by artificial fall leaves and small candles. For another country club party, two of his designers, Rebecca Laird and Erich Molloy, also designed centerpieces in nontraditional colors for Halloween: purple and dusky blue, with cutouts in the shape of crescent moons and wizard hats. For a children's party Mr. Benjamin created a game. \\n\\nHe painted garbage can lids black and affixed to the inside of each a deflated Mylar balloon depicting a jack-o'-lantern with bright eyes, nose and mouth. Youngsters toss magnetic disks at the pumpkin face; whoever covers the features most accurately wins the most points. \\n\\n\\"What we are doing with Halloween and with our other parties is creating an atmosphere, an ambiance,\\" Mr. Benjamin said.  \\"We are taking an idea, a concept, and giving it concrete, visual expression.\\" The View From: Port Chester;\\nHalloween Is So Popular, It's Scary"},{"year":"1967","title":"ONCE in a while, during a strong open tournament, a dark-horse teen-ager will knock a favorite out of the running for top honors, When that happens, the fans wonder: Who is the upstart?

The play follows the drunken progress of a cocktail party, which takes place in the Park Avenue apartment of Clayton Maguire (Dana Vance), a successful television journalist with a career-fracturing secret.

Mr. Greider contends that these groups work their will through money and manipulation. He writes: \\"A major industry has grown up in Washington around what might be called 'democracy for hire' -- business firms and outposts of sponsored scholars devoted to concocting facts and opinions and expert analysis, then aiming them at the government. That is the principal function of all those enterprises along Washington's main boulevards like K Street -- the public-relations agencies, the direct-mail companies and opinion-polling firms.

The method, which involves creating a copper printing plate from a photographic positive, was developed in the late 19th century but gave way after World War I to faster, cheaper and less intricate ways of printing multiple copies. Still unsurpassed for high-quality reproduction, however, with its capacities for conveying subtle tones, retaining the crispness of details, and thick, lustrous inking, hand-pulled photogravure has been rediscovered today by such artists as John Baldessari, Lorna Simpson, William Wegman, Christian Boltanski and the team of McDermott and McGough, for works that range from cutting edge to deliberately old-fangled pastiche.         The early photographs in \\"Photogravure -- A Survey: 1903-1996\\" still show a close affinity to painting, and photogravure could perfectly capture the shadows, dappled light and romantic haziness in which camera buffs enveloped their Old Masterish subjects and archly posed portraits.

At the onset of World War I, Italy had enjoyed less than half a century of unified statehood. Its artistic aspirations were suspended between the Fascist desire for an undiluted Italy and the belle epoque's romance with nature, between a mimicry of other European styles and the reincorporation of Italy's own classical legacy, between a giddy quest for an avant-garde and a vernacular means to persuade a population, 30 percent of which was illiterate, to feel optimism amid an economic crisis. As Mr. Heller, the art director of The New York Times Book Review, and Ms. Fili, a New York designer, show, the resultant style incorporated a humanizing of technology, a mythic treatment of contemporary imagery, and airbrushed shapes that suggested an egoless production. While the Futurists' work by self-definition was a reckless, audacious movement -- for industry it proved frivolous, for advertising almost useless -- the resulting graphic work extracted the workable, pragmatic aspects otherwise buried in the rarefied bombast of art manifestoes. \\"Italian Art Deco\\" displays the objects of Italy's longed-for arte-vita, the availability of art in everyday life. Fifty years later, the Art Moderne designers' dreams of a future with radio, air travel and robots has been fulfilled, and still their designs possess the radiance of a charmed modernity.\\nMICHAEL J.

''It's when things are upside down and you start to like them that way,'' he says. Which pretty much describes what happens to his character, Mike Max, who at the start of the film is ordering people around from poolside and ignoring his wife, but by the end is looking from the outside in at his old life. In between, an attempt is made on his life, some immigrant gardeners take him in and a mysterious F.B.I. file is sent to his computer. The file involves a plan for a high-tech surveillance system that will keep an eye on the streets, bringing ''the end of violence'' (and, yes, calling to mind some recent government eavesdropping). It's all left tantalizingly understated and a bit creepy.

He plays a psychologist sent to a space station to investigate the erratic behavior of its crew","excerpt":"when he arrives, he finds bloodstains and body bags. ''Can you tell me what's happening here?'' he asks one of the few survivors. The man replies: ''I could tell you what's happening, but I don't know if that would really tell you what's happening.'' And it only gets more ambiguous from there. Among other things, Mr. Clooney's character is visited by something resembling his wife (Natascha McElhone, above left, with Mr. Clooney), who had committed suicide back on earth.

The earlier film is full of seemingly pointless shots of Benji (right), a moderately cute stray dog, running, walking, and running some more. Yet the mutt apparently caught some people's attention, because the film, made independently by Joe Camp and shown in Texas and a few other states in 1974, became the other animal-film hit of 1975 when it went national that summer (along with a little shark flick called ''Jaws''). In Mr. Camp's sparse tale, Benji saves two kidnapped children and becomes a film franchise.    28 DAYS (2000)  Friday at 9 p.m. on Lifetime  The same year that she scored big with ''Miss Congeniality,'' Sandra Bullock tried a riskier type of comedy in this film, in which she plays a party girl who winds up in a rehabilitation center after a drunken disaster at her sister's wedding. Ms. Bullock has some impressive moments as a booze-and-pill addict spinning out of control, and once she gets to rehab she is surrounded by an unusual crew. Steve Buscemi is her counselor, Viggo Mortensen (left, with Ms. Bullock) is a fellow patient who becomes a love interest, and, most intriguing of all, the folk singer Loudon Wainwright III is an eclectic sort of Greek chorus.

THEATER: 'RUSH RIFE,' BY THE RUSSELL FAMILY"},{"year":"1928","title":"The most noteworthy thing this picture has done is to give a reasonable explanation for the fact that two persons may look alike. Such situations are not unusual in the silent, but moving, drama, yet usually they are merely presented as the result of divine intervention into the twists of unkind fate. It is a solution which, might well be copied.The picture deals with an impoverished Marquis who married the daughter of a wealthy widow of ponderous proportions and no manners. His bride bores him a little, and the mother-in-law is naturally the last straw. To make matters worse, he has the reputation of being a coward, a slander which he doesn't quite deserve.There are two bronze keys to the apartment of this young couple, one of which is stolen by the villain. The wife then places hers in her husband's dressing gown, where he finds it, believing, naturally, that it is his own. How, then, did the other get into the hands of the villain? He forms the inevitable conclusion and decides to go away to the ancestral estate. An automobile wreck on the way knocks him unconscious","excerpt":"when he comes to again he sees another man with a face and figure just like his. Explanations follow, and it develops that the other man is a tenant on the estate, the son of a maid-servant in the Marquis's father's castle.As both young men need money, the farmer is persuaded to change places with the other and go back to the mother-in-law in order to get the marriage dowry. He does so and is promptly enveloped into the lurid meshes of love for the beautiful bride. He also beats up the villain, who promptly challenges him to a duel. The Marquis comes back about that time, receives the challenge, fights and is killed. That leaves the way open.\\"A Husband by Proxy\\" is not a hilarious thing, although there are several moments of mirth scattered in a patchwork array throughout. Of the two persons who look alike, Mr. Ekman is better as the Marquis than he is as the tenant. There are scenes to the picture which because of their over-emphasis are literally painful.

In essence, it is neither more nor less than the usual story of high adventure, of a \\"he-man\\" in a \\"he-man's\\" world. But Mr. Tracy makes one forget all that. When he grins, his audience grins with him","excerpt":"when he comes to the rescue, adults join the youngsters in the cheering.\\"Shanghai Madness,\\" despite a title which may suggest several themes or none at all, is a straightforward melodrama. Its action is rapid, its dialogue brief and to the point, and it has not been cluttered up with non-essentials. There is a hero, (Mr. Tracy), and a heroine, (Fay Wray), and a host of villains identified generally as Chinese Communists.Mr. Tracy has the rôle of Pat Jackson, a fighting Lieutenant in the United States Navy. He is court-martialed and drummed out of the service for having disobeyed orders by returning the fire of Chinese Communists after they had killed two of his men. This seems a pretty thin excuse for his dismissal, but it is explained there is danger of a diplomatic \\"incident\\" arising.Shanghai shippers are prejudiced against hiring a man with a naval discharge to his discredit and Jackson is fortunate in finding a berth as gunner on a ship smuggling arms to Chinese forces up-river. During his search for work, he has met and been designated as a future husband by Wildeth Christie, daughter of an influential British resident. Mr. Christie frowns upon the romance, but Wildeth, not to be thwarted, smuggles herself aboard the gun-runner.She is set ashore at a mission just in time for the Communists to stage a surprise attack upon it. Seeing the American flag flying upside-down, the traditional distress signal, Jackson goes to the rescue, machine-gun in hand, forgetting that he has no reason to like the American flag. His heroism can have only one reward.Mr. Tracy gives a sincere and always in-character performance. Miss Wray narrowly justifies her presence in a film which could have done just as well without a heroine. Eugene Pallette is amusingly cast as the skipper of the gun-runner and Reginald Mason, Arthur Hoyt and Maude Eburne are satisfactory in minor rôles.On the Roxy Stage.Having postponed the return of the Silly Symphony, \\"Three Little Pigs,\\" until next week, Save Schooler and his orchestra are telling the story of the pigs and the \\"big, bad wolf\\" on the stage.

Like many of Leavitt's subsequent books, ''Family Dancing'' dealt with homosexuality, and in this week's issue he contributes an essay about the demise of many of this country's gay bookstores. The buying and selling of gay-themed books has come a long way in two decades, he said in a telephone interview. ''When I was growing up in Northern California, there was -- and still is -- a great bookstore in Menlo Park called Kepler's, and it had a gay shelf tucked way in the back of the store. I remember sneaking back there, very furtively, and I was always terrified someone would see me. There was a lot of anxiety and fear about these books, particularly for a young person, even in California in the 1970's. It's hard to believe how much things have changed.'' Leavitt, who lives in Gainesville, Fla., and teaches creative writing at the University of Florida, said that, on some level, gay bookstores have simply become irrelevant. ''These stores no longer serve the function they once did. They were community centers, they were sources of information.

You can see this in her appearance (the tailored suits, the chiseled face, the exotic appearance) and the elite résumé (stints as a lawyer at Skadden Arps and as an investment banker at Lehman Brothers). You can also see it in her personal history and opinions. Born in England, raised in poverty in Australia by a mother who is half-Russian and half-Ugandan, Mowbray-d'Arbela, 38, has never smoked. In her view, no one should. And those who do should quit. Those who have failed to quit should try again. She does not take issue with the World Health Organization's projection that 500 million people now alive will eventually die from smoking-related diseases","excerpt":"when I first met her for breakfast late last winter in Manhattan, she actually pointed me to that very statistic. She then made an impassioned presentation about the toxins in tobacco, a display so granularly detailed and footnoted and cross-indexed that when she began to talk about the 4,000 or so chemicals (including some 60 known carcinogens) released by every burning cigarette, a tally now agreed upon by virtually all tobacco scientists, I feared she might list every one.    In fact, Mowbray-d'Arbela is not a tobacco executive but the head of a Hong Kong-based biotechnology company, Filligent, that has created a filter for a new type of cigarette. This cigarette, produced by an independent tobacco company at a factory in Timberlake, N.C., is expected to go on sale later this month in several states under the brand name Fact. It looks like any other cigarette, smells like any other cigarette, draws like any other cigarette. But if you were to tear apart a Fact cigarette, as I did one spring morning at the North Carolina plant, the filter would seem peculiar. Divided into two halves, the segment called the ''mouth end'' is composed of a white fibrous material, cellulose acetate, found in almost all cigarette filters. But the other half -- a plug inserted between the mouth end and the tobacco -- looks like tightly wadded crepe paper, colored teal blue. This segment, treated with a patented chemical process developed by several scientists over the past 12 years, screens out a variety of cancer-causing toxins. In several independent lab tests I obtained, Filligent's filter appeared to substantially reduce the mutagenic activity caused by cigarette smoke. Compared with a typical cigarette, those reductions (as measured per milligram of nicotine, an essential way to evaluate how many chemicals a smoker is ingesting) generally ranged between 40 and 75 percent.

In a couple of weeks, NBC will devote 10 hours to Marco Polo and his travels in the 13th century. And tonight at 9, ABC is offering ''Mae West,'' described by the network as the story of an actress ''who built her stardom on sex, yet struggled to find fulfillment with the one man she truly loved.''   The viewer is advised at the outset that the script, written by E.  Arthur Kean, is ''based on events in the life of the legendary Mae West.'' Legend, of course, doesn't necessarily have anything to do with truth. In this case, certain autobiographical facts are embellished with several of Miss West's more famous comments about life and sex (''When I'm good, I'm very good","excerpt":"when I'm bad, I'm better''), some of them taken out of their original performance context and delivered as passing conversation. In the process, the woman behind the public image emerges as a trailblazing feminist and a brave denouncer of censorship. Her detractors, however, are offered a measure of comfort in the depiction of her private love life as a mess. The wicked, presumably, will still be punished.

Mia Famiglia is the rare Italian store in that it actually resembles a store you could find in Italy.

In addition to providing extraordinary service in the department store line, they display collections from major American and European museums, offer beauty salons staffed with experts in traditional dress, rent formal clothes, maintain photographic studios where tuxedo- or kimono-clad customers can have their portraits taken, and manage restaurants, lots of restaurants -- indeed, a dozen or more within a single store is not unusual. The menus are eclectic, though most serve some kind of yoshoku, or Western-style, cuisine. From the turn of this century on, the Japanese have been smitten with Western cooking, although many of the dishes that have evolved from this love affair, such as korokke (croquettes) or omuraisu (soft omelets filled  with ketchup-flavored pilaf), may not slide easily down an American throat. The  Japanese also enjoy chuka ryori (Chinese style) adaptations and their own native washoku cooking.

For example, the Court has created exceptions to its once-total ban on the use of unconstitutionally seized evidence, but it seems unreceptive to Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d's suggestions that this ''exclusionary rule'' be abolished entirely.   And while refusing last week to impose new limits on police interrogation of suspects or any limits at all on deception of their lawyers, the Court reaffirmed its established rules that the police must inform arrested suspects of their rights to remain silent and to have a lawyer.

Lowe-Porter's apology -- \\"better . . . an English version . . . done ill than not done at all\\" -- was exaggerated, but his vocabulary was wholly Victorian, and he missed Mann's voice. Mr. Woods makes Mann talk much as we do, if always more intelligently, and he captures the irony and humor in all but a few passages. Little things count greatly. Here the words chosen for medicines, food, furniture, gestures and sounds put us in familiar surroundings, which makes the artificiality of Hans Castorp's situation in the sanitarium even more ominous. When despair breathes on his neck as he lounges in a loggia (Lowe-Porter) we hardly notice","excerpt":"when it startles him as he sits on a balcony (Mr. Woods) we are shocked. For a larger comparison, look at the \\"Operationes Spirituales\\" section at the center of the novel -- the historical, theological and philosophical argument that opens the fatal battle between Leo Naphta and Settembrini. Mr. Woods captures perfectly the superior but not malicious tone of the author; Lowe-Porter gets little of it. Of course, the pleasure of going through any translation is to catch lapses, and in a work so long and learned there are chances to mock any version. For instance, do we know more about Settembrini's appearance when Mr. Woods has him wear an \\"ineluctable petersham coat\\" than we did when Lowe-Porter clad him in an \\"inevitable pilot-coat\\"? This garment is meant to reveal something of the man's politics and philosophy; it was often the garb of free thinkers in European cartoons and drawings early in this century.

She followed this success with the publication of her landmark book, ''On Death and Dying: What the Dying Have to Teach Doctors, Nurses, Clergy and Their Own Family.'' The 1969 book, which has never been out of print, limned the now famous stages of the terminally ill: denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance. These stages were presented anecdotally, without scientific apparatus, and are often criticized for creating an unattainable ideal of a ''good death,'' but Kübler-Ross's book dealt a shattering blow to the denial of death in America. Though she did not create the hospice movement, it is difficult to imagine its widespread acceptance in this country without her tireless campaign on its behalf.

The shadows, it turned out, were caused by nothing more than the undulating white curtains wafting in the breeze. Mr. Hitchcock seemed a trifle disappointed to look out the window and see only sky and distant rooftops.    The room was on the 20th floor of the hotel, so there couldn't very well have been a tree outside the window. But in Mr. Hitchcock's universe, almost anything is possible. His songs are alive with fantastic detail. A man shaped like a balloon walks up Sixth Avenue and bursts.

Most worrisome for Israel are its highly volatile non-Government foreign loans, which amounted to some $7 billion at the close of 1984.

It was in the fall of 1965 that this writer began contributing his regular commentaries on the current art scene to the columns of this paper, and with the present article he brings his tenure as the art critic of The Times to a close. It therefore seems an appropriate moment to re-examine this very turbulent period in the history of our artistic affairs.   In several important respects, the art scene as we know it today owes its essential features - and most especially, the scale of its operations - to the cultural world that came into existence in the 1960's. It was then that the two National Endowments were created and the role of the Federal Government in the art life of the country began to gather momentum. It was in the 1960's, too, that our museums launched their mega-building programs, and enlarged their staffs, their budgets and their exhibition programs accordingly. (There was another area of significant growth that has received very little attention - the increase in size and influence of the museums' public relations staff.) The number of art galleries increased dramatically, too, and - what is probably the most important development of all - so did the sheer numbers of people, both talented and otherwise, who came forward to claim a place as professional artists.
