It is with great sadness that we announce the death of Tita Monti. Mrs. Monti, 85, a resident of Sands Point, NY, for more than 45 years, was an extraordinary woman with a generous heart and determination who revolutionized cancer care on Long Island. Just a few days after the 1972 death of her 16-year-old son Don Monti from myeloblastic leukemia, Tita and her husband, Joseph, founded the Don Monti Memorial Research Foundation. Over the past 34 years, it has raised more than $30 million for cancer research, education, fellowship and patient care. ''The idea was to bring the best of care to patients suffering from this dread disease,'' she said in a 1996 interview. ''That means top quality medical care as well as compassion. Our division is like a family, even though it has grown so big. From nothing, tremendous things have happened.'' In 1972, North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, NY, was a community hospital. With the Montis' support and leadership, its cancer programs grew by leaps and bounds. As the hospital grew, the Montis' support grew as well - in fact a pavilion, the Division of Oncology/Hematology, a research laboratory and the adult bone marrow transplant unit are all named in Don's honor. The Montis underwrote all administrative costs of the Foundation. Mrs. Monti was by no means a figurehead on the Foundation's letterhead. For nearly three decades, she came to her office at the hospital five days a week, overseeing all details of the Don Monti Memorial Research Foundation, both great and small. Her door was always open and patients often stopped by. Particularly close to Mrs. Monti's heart was the annual cancer Survivors' Day, which routinely attracts more than 2,000 attendees annually to celebrate life. Mrs. Monti was born Tita Scandalis in Pelham, NY, the daughter of Greek immigrants. She began playing piano as a child and performed at Carnegie Hall at the age of 11. Her singing voice matured and she became a dramatic soprano. She gave up piano to study and coach voice at the Juilliard School of Music. There, she met and married Joseph Monti, a tenor. Mrs. Monti taught school for a decade and then raised three children, Caroline, Don and Richard. Mrs. Monti was a patron of the Metropolitan Opera, a benefactor of Long Island University's Tilles Center for the Performing Arts, a member of the International Executive Board of Boys Town and Girls Town of Italy, and a member of the Board of Directors at LaSalle Center. During her lifetime, Mrs. Monti was recognized by many organizations for her outstanding contributions, including the Eleanor Roosevelt Community Service Award from New York State and the 1998 Ellis Island Medal of Honor Award. She also received a Doctorate of Humane Letters in recognition of her contributions to cancer care research, education and philanthropy. Mrs. Monti is survived by her husband of 62 years, Joseph, children Caroline Monti Saladino and Richard Monti, son-in-law Arthur Saladino, 10 grandchildren, six great grandchildren and sisters Bess Hatsis and Joan Tegtmeier.

Leon was a generous and caring man who gave and asked for nothing in return. He was a long time member of Walnut Hill United Methodist Church where he was considered family by many. Leon was born in New York, NY to Harry and Sophia (Greene) Pritzker. After attending New York City College, Leon entered the United States Army and served as a cryptanalyst in World War II from 1943-1946. Leon was a master of seven languages. Upon leaving the Army, he went to work for the Census Bureau where he worked as a Statistician in Washington DC from 1947-1961, and in the Chief Response Research branch from 1961-1967. In 1967 Leon left the Census Bureau to become the Director of Marketing Information Services for Anheuser-Busch, Inc. in St. Louis, MO. In 1973 he became the Director of Management Systems for Anheuser-Busch, Inc. In 1984 he was asked to be the Executive Vice-President of Staff Operations for Campbell Taggart, Inc. Dallas, a newly acquired company by Anheuser-Busch, Inc. In 1990 Leon retired from AnheuserBusch and Campbell Taggart, but consulted for many years thereafter. Leon was well known in the mathematics and statistics communities as well as being a respected food company executive. Leon married his beloved wife MaryAnne E. (Watts) Pritzker on her birthday, December 12, 1970. They have five children and 12 grandchildren, with one greatgrandchild on the way. Leon earned his BS from the City College of New York in 1942. After W.W.II, he earned his Master's from the University of Pennsylvania in 1947. Leon was a member of Sigma Xi and Phi Beta Kappa. Leon Pritzker is listed in the Who's Who in America, Who's Who in the Midwest, and the American Men of Science. Leon was a visiting faculty member of the Case Institute Technical College in Cleveland, OH from 1954-1955, consulted for the Census and Statistical Bureau, Government of Israel, Jerusalem in 1961, and was an Instructor of Statistics for the Government of Turkey, Ankara, in 1967. Leon served with honor in the United States Army from 1943-46. He was a recipient of the Commerce Departments Meritorious Service Award (1954). Leon contributed numerous articles to professional journals and was cited in many other publications. Leon is a Fellow in the American Statistical Association, and member in Operations Research Society, Society for Information Management, International Association of Survey Statisticians, and the Walnut Hill United Methodist Church. Leon taught Sunday school and was a mentor to many of his fellow parishioners. Leon truly lived as if each day was the day that the Lord had made, and rejoiced in each of them. Leon was a wonderful father, husband, grandfather and friend. His passing will leave an unimaginable void on this earth, and he will be dearly missed. A memorial was held to celebrate the life of Leon Pritzker at Walnut Hill United Methodist Church in Dallas on November 4, 2005. A private committal was held at Restland Memorial Park.

And on Thursday evening, Mr. Costello and the group concluded a 10-country concert tour with a sold-out appearance at Town Hall.    The music of \\"The Juliet Letters\\" could not be described as \\"crossover\\" in the manner of Barbra Streisand's \\"Classical Barbra\\" or Kiri Te Kanawa's recent album of Michel Legrand songs. Its 20 compositions are collaborations by Mr. Costello and the quartet in which they explore a juxtaposition of musical genres that many assume to be antithetical.

If the neighboring farmer's hired man ''had touched a drop at all,'' the teenage hero of ''In the Province of Saints'' recalls, ''he'd be singing -- some familiar Irish song about rebels or emigration and the never never of coming back","excerpt":"songs about the loss of land, the loss of love, but most of all, songs about . . . longing for Ireland.'' O'Malley's beautifully written first novel also sings many of those songs. Set in rural southeastern Ireland in the late 1970's, it tells the coming-of-age story of Michael McDonagh. Michael roams the fields and rivers when he is not caring for his mother, who is ill with cancer, while his father leaves for Boston to find work and then drinks up his earnings. There is much talk of rain, and ghosts, and the smell of dung, and the reader feels the claustrophobia and hopelessness that coexist with the wild beauty of the land. As Michael grows up, he comes to terms with his family's secrets, both personal and political. In the end we know that he, too, will leave Ireland for good. A familiar Irish song, but the words will break your heart.       44 SCOTLAND STREET. By Alexander McCall Smith. Illustrations by Iain McIntosh. (Anchor, paper, $13.95.) When McCall Smith told an Edinburgh newspaper editor about meeting Armistead Maupin, whose ''Tales of the City'' had been serialized in The San Francisco Chronicle, the editor challenged him to produce a novel of his own to be published in daily installments. ''44 Scotland Street'' is McCall Smith's response. In 110 chapters, few longer than two pages, he follows the inhabitants of an apartment building ''on the edge of the bohemian part of the Edinburgh New Town, the part where lawyers and accountants were outnumbered -- just -- by others.'' Pat, a bright woman of 20 who is taking her second ''gap year'' before college, answers an ad for a room in a flat rented by Bruce Anderson, a real-estate assessor and narcissistic lady-killer; Pat, naturally, falls for him. She takes a job as a receptionist at an art gallery whose hapless owner just as naturally falls for Pat. Other residents of No. 44 represent Edinburgh types, old and new. The short chapters and frequent switches among characters are annoying at first, but eventually the reader settles into the book's rhythms. McCall Smith, the author of the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency series, is a pro, and he delivers sharp observation, gentle satire and a surprising plot twist as well as the expected romantic complications. It is clear even to an outsider that someone who knows Edinburgh would recognize many people and places in ''44 Scotland Street.'' But an outsider can still relish McCall Smith's depiction of this place ''of angled streets and northern light,'' and enjoy his tolerant, good-humored company.

Her regal, high-fashion appearance and musical tastes that run from Edith Piaf to high-toned American theater songs all suggest a musician who sees her material as an offshoot of European art song. That taste extends to instrumental settings that treat almost everything as a kind of frilly semi-classical chamber music.    The singer's biggest challenge has always been how to transcend that image and do more than express an elegantly stifled angst. And in her new show at the Ballroom (253 West 28th Street), which runs through Saturday, she has taken another small step toward becoming a genuinely communicative entertainer. On Thursday the normally shy singer talked about her parents, her teen-age sons and her currently happy love life with an emphatic emotionality that at moments bordered on tearfulness. The personal reflections were interwoven among performances of \\"More Than You Know,\\" \\"If I Sing,\\" \\"Unchained Melody\\" and others, in which Ms. Akers projected an optimism that was almost vehement.

From the Beatles and the Beach Boys down through Queen, Squeeze and XTC, rock has also been a medium for ingenuity and duplicity. Ever-so-clever pop constructions, full of key and tempo and textural changes, can carry equally clever lyrics that defy the simple pleasures of their sugar-coated tunes. Rock's most lapidary songwriters are willing to trade a show of spontaneity for a show of precision and whimsy, demonstrating just how elaborate a song can be.   Jellyfish, a band from San Francisco that performed on Friday night at the Academy, proudly joins pop's lineage of tuneful tricksters. Its songs cheerfully invite listeners to spot the derivations: the bouncy chords from Squeeze, the falsetto voice over rumbling drums from the Beach Boys, the vocal-harmony glissandos from Queen, the arrangements from the Beatles's \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.\\" Its verbal strategies are close to those of Squeeze","excerpt":"songs from Jellyfish's two albums, \\"Bellybutton\\" and \\"Spilt Milk\\" (both on Charisma , used big words and fragmented narratives to address topics like the resemblance of rock fan clubs to televangelists' fund-raising (\\"Joining a Fan Club\\"), getting away with betrayal (\\"All Is Forgiven\\"), a philandering principal (\\"Now She Knows She's Wrong,\\" which rhymes \\"D.N.A.\\" and \\"P.T.A.\\") or masturbation (\\"He's My Best Friend\\").

On the cover of \\"Time Is on My Side: The Best of Irma Thomas\\" (EMI), a compilation of her 1960's soul hits that was released early this year, she's wearing a gold dress of fringed lame, with the straps just slightly off her shoulders. Ms. Thomas was young when the picture was taken, probably in her early 20's, and her face has an expression of unbreachable confidence. She's pointing her finger, as if about to tell someone just what she thinks of him. The light sparkles white and sharp off the gold of her dress.   And last Friday night at Tramps, where she is performing again tonight, Ms. Thomas wore a glittering gold-sequined jacket over a multicolored sequin top. She looked younger than her 51 years, and every aspect of the performance demonstrated a supreme control. Her movements were smooth and graceful. She knew exactly what to give the audience and when to give it. Her voice glided through the words and melodies with a sure and practiced ease. Even when she cut loose and reached for a strong, steady high note, it was with the absolute knowledge of the power a singer can communicate.

Sound familiar? The suite of dances is set to some of the same Brahms songs as Balanchine's \\"Liebeslieder Walzer,\\" and both touch on similar themes of love and estrangement. But Mr. Feld's ballet is charged with overt emotions. It is a rush through a dimly lit ballroom echoing with sobs and laughter instead of decorous social conversation.    The man and woman in one of the four couples know each other intimately enough so that the man's quick lowering of the woman into deep falls looks both easy and devastating -- as dance and as emotional behavior. Another man and woman know each other less well. Their protracted, chilling battle may kill them, or at least their love. The woman dances away from the crowd in a troubled, dreaming solo. The man slides urgently through as two other couples dance, then hurtles back to his partner. And a young woman moves away to dance by herself, looking as lost as if she were the only one awake in a dream.

It is to be assumed that he was forced to follow the script and is therefore not responsible for the melodramatic incidents or guileless dialogue.The narrative is based on one furnished by George Grossmith, the British stage producer and actor, and Zolton Korda. It is enhanced by several pleasing songs composed by William Kernel. J. Harold Murray, who appears as Charles Jackson, an American rum and gun runner, does very well in some of these musical contributions. He sings of women of love and the Foreign Legion. As he happens to be in a tuneful mood on his gun-running schooner, he lifts his voice to the tune of \\"Women Everywhere,\\" but soon afterward he finds himself a prisoner of the French, who apprehend him and others for furnishing arms to the Arabs. It is a piece of impertinence that is supposed to be paid for by a bullet through the heart at dawn.Jackson has all the fortune that any hero has ever been allowed by an author. He meets Lili LaFleur in the Squinting Cat cabaret in Marseilles, and this song-bird and dancer, played by Fifi Dorsay, does wonders in helping Jackson to evade the hawk-eyed French military police. The gun-running adventure, however, brings with it a heap of annoyance, for after having fallen in love with Lili, Jackson, to save his skin, discovers that he has to choose between the full penalty or joining the Foreign Legion.In that group of men who want to bury their pasts, Jackson becomes a popular hero and all his rum-running and gun-running crimes are forgotten.Mr. Grossmith appears as the proprietor of the Squinting Cat. He gives quite an amusing performance, although one or two of the supposed witticisms which he voices are somewhat antiquated. Mr. Grossmith and Miss Dorsay have their chance to sing and they are far more successful than some more noted performers in this line have been on the screen.Mr. Korda obviously has been handicapped in dealing with the foreign atmosphere, but he has many compelling scenes, particularly those of the Arabs and the French soldiers on the desert sands. The high lights and shadows in these glimpses are most impressive. The interior scenes have received considerable attention, which atones partly for the shortcomings of the story.Miss Dorsay is believable as Fifi. Clyde Cook does not make much of a mark as Sam Brown, a cockney sailor. Rose Dione is capital as the adipose cabaret manager. Ralph Kellard as the villain seems to be a little too cognizant of what he's going to say before he says it.

He plays music that rarely challenges his own historical achievements, and that in its simplicity seems to pander to his audience.

Anywhere he wants.   Well, almost. Norio Ogha, the president of Sony Corporation and an avid amateur conductor, will be on the podium at Avery Fisher Hall on May 12 at 7:30 P.M., conducting Beethoven's Seventh and Schubert's \\"Unfinished\\" symphonies and Strauss's \\"Fledermaus\\" Overture in a benefit concert for the Lincoln Center Consolidated Corporate Fund. His orchestra is to be billed as Members of the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra, a freelance ensemble drawn largely from the pool of Met players.   But leading a freelance band was not how Sony had hoped Mr. Ogha would make his New York conducting debut. In September, Michael P. Schulhof, the vice chairman of Sony U.S.A., approached the New York Philharmonic about putting his boss on the orchestra's podium, but he made little headway.   \\"I cannot comment on that,\\" the Philharmonic's managing director, Deborah Borda, said at the time. \\"But as a matter of policy, we do not hire the orchestra out, and if there had been any discussions, that's what we would have said.\\" A Newcomer? Not Really    Actually, although Mr. Ogha's passion for conducting may at a glance look like dilettantism supported by corporate muscle, he comes to this avocation with a solid musical background. He took both a bachelor's and a master's degree in music from the Tokyo University of Fine Arts in 1954 and then studied voice (he is a baritone) in Munich with Gerhard Husch, the legendary German lieder singer. He earned another music degree in Berlin before returning to Japan and starting a career as a recitalist and opera singer.   \\"But even then,\\" Mr. Ogha said the other day at Sony's Manhattan headquarters, \\"I wanted to be a conductor as well. I studied conducting, score-reading, composition, harmony and counterpoint. I also studied the flute and, starting when I was very young, the piano.\\"   In the early 1960's, Mr. Ogha worked for Sony during the day and sang at night, but he gave up his double life after he fell asleep and nearly missed his cue in a performance of \\"Le Nozze di Figaro.\\"   But his work at Sony kept him in touch with the classical music world. From 1968 until he became Sony's president in 1982, he ran CBS/Sony, the Japanese arm of CBS Records, and in 1987 he oversaw Sony's acquisition of CBS Records. In the late 1970's, when Sony and Philips collaborated on the development of the compact disk, it was Mr. Ogha's idea that the disk be able to accommodate Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, at about 74 minutes.   Mr. Ogha began conducting in public in 1990, when he was 60, and has conducted benefit concerts in Tokyo and Germany for the Poland Relief Fund and a handful of arts organizations and festivals. He said he studies his scores every morning from 2:30 to 5. \\"That way,\\" he said, \\"it's on my time, not Sony's time.\\" 'A Great Feel for the Music'    Nathan Leventhal, the president of Lincoln Center, saw a video of one of Mr. Ogha's concerts at a demonstration of Sony's high-definition television system in Tokyo in August.   \\"He was conducting the Schubert 'Unfinished,' \\" Mr. Leventhal recalled. \\"It was a very musical performance, very graceful. He obviously had a great feel for the music. So when Mickey Schulhof proposed his conducting a benefit for Lincoln Center, I agreed to it.\\"   Still, one senses slight hesitation at Lincoln Center about the idea of a well-connected, enthusiastic amateur conducting on the institution's behalf. Several officials noted pointedly that the concert is a private, philanthropic event, not a Lincoln Center presentation. The proceeds are to be divided among all the Lincoln Center constituents, and David Rivel, Lincoln Center's vice president for marketing, said previous events have typically raised $200,000.   This one will apparently do better than that. Mr. Schulhof said that one of Sony's competitors, Warner Music, has agreed to contribute $100,000 and Sony would donate even more. Sony has also undertaken the task of selling tickets, at $50 to $100. Information: (800) 526-7669.   As for Mr. Ogha, it seems that in purely musical matters he is not entirely a company man. Asked which recording of the Beethoven Seventh is his favorite, he thought for a moment and said that it was Carlos Kleiber's, with the Vienna Philharmonic. On Deutsche Grammophon. Spoleto Skirmish    The Spoleto Festival U.S.A., the arts festival in Charleston, S.C., that seems constitutionally unable to get through a season peaceably, has already logged its first roster-altering dispute of 1993. John Kennedy, the festival's orchestra manager for several years and since 1990 the director of its 20th Century Perspectives series of contemporary music concerts, has resigned because of musical and philosophical differences with Steven Mercurio, the festival's music director.   The disagreement began when Mr. Mercurio, a conductor and composer, suggested that he and Mr. Kennedy share the direction of the three-concert series, which was the only significant exploration of contemporary music offered at last year's festival. Mr. Kennedy said in a telephone interview that although he objected to relinquishing control of the series, he nevertheless discussed some ideas with Mr. Mercurio. But when Mr. Mercurio suggested that works by several neo-Romantic and early 20th-century composers be included in the programs, Mr. Kennedy resolved to leave.   \\"It would be impossible for me to forge casual collaborations of 20th- century music with you,\\" he wrote to Mr. Mercurio, \\"because I consider programming itself to be an act of critical importance. Among the composers you mentioned, I do not feel Maurice Ravel, Igor Stravinsky or George Gershwin needs introduction or advocacy to audiences in the context of my series.\\"   Mr. Kennedy added that he did not care for the work of several other composers Mr. Mercurio suggested.   Mr. Mercurio, reached by telephone in Washington, where he was conducting \\"Turandot\\" at the Washington Opera, said that as a composer he thought he should have a hand in the festival's contemporary component. But he insisted that he offered Mr. Kennedy concessions, among them allowing him a hand in the new-music programming at the parent festival in Spoleto, Italy.   \\"He wanted to do a Cage retrospective,\\" Mr. Mercurio said, \\"and I was willing to give him that concert. It's not as if I was trying to wrest this away from him.\\"   Mr. Kennedy said he did not think he had deliberately been pushed out of the festival, and both he and Mr. Mercurio said the festival's founder and artistic director, Gian Carlo Menotti, had no part in the fight.

The director is Samuel Bayer (of ''Smells Like Teen Spirit'' fame) and the song is ''Wake Me Up When September Ends,'' a power ballad from the band's great and greatly popular 2004 album ''American Idiot'' (Reprise). (It can be seen at www.greenday.com.) Somehow, Mr. Bayer has made a seven-minute video that's even more melodramatic than the song: the actors Jamie Bell and Evan Rachel Wood interrupt the music to express their bliss (to be young and in love!) and, a few minutes later, anxiety (to be young and enlisted!)","excerpt":"soon she's home worrying, and he's away warring. Like most wars, the Iraq war has simultaneously deepened political divisions and scrambled them. And so though the band members and director may mean this video as a strong antiwar statement, it also works pretty well as a support-our-troops statement for the emo age. On shows like MTV's ''Total Request Live,'' many of the people requesting it aren't trying to send a message to the government; they're trying to send a message to boyfriends and girlfriends overseas.    Laura Veirs       On her new album, ''Year of Meteors'' (Nonesuch), Ms. Veirs finds melodies mellow and buoyant enough to make her words float and sometimes fly. Her lyrics are full of vivid phrases that often decline the demands of predictable meter and rhythm: ''Lake swimming/ Shucking free our deadened selves/ Like snakes and corn do.'' The album is full of lovely and mysterious songs, some spiky with guitar noise and some propelled by graceful sideways grooves. In ''Black Gold Blues,'' Eyvind Kang's viola leads the raucous charge while Ms. Veirs adds a triumphant spark of her own: ''A sliver, a crack of light/ Is all you need to see.''    Smog       The great indie-rock singer-songwriter Bill Callahan, who performs as Smog, recently released the album ''A River Ain't Too Much to Love'' (Drag City), along with a music video. In the clip for ''I Feel Like the Mother of the World,'' a glum and typically acute song, Bryce Kass directs Chloë Sevigny as an eye-patch-wearing chambermaid dragging herself through a day. (The video can be seen at dominorecordco.com.) Mr. Callahan uses his not-quite-tuneful voice to deliver lyrics that sharply juxtapose the formal (''God is a word/ And the argument ends there'') with the casual (''When I was a boy I used to get into it bad with my sister''). And it's weirdly satisfying when he finally makes his appearance: Ms. Sevigny's character cleans a room while the television is on, and there he is, behind a desk; a stiff newscaster reading half-stiff lyrics.    New Buffalo       ''The Last Beautiful Day'' is the intoxicating album by Sally Seltmann, an Australian who records as New Buffalo (www.newbuffalo.net). The album was released in her homeland last year, and on Tuesday the Canadian indie-rock label Arts and Crafts is to issue a North American version. Ms. Seltmann's marvelous songs make themselves visible slowly, as deceptively casual tunes and arrangements hint at shivery pledges and pleas. Perhaps nothing is more memorable than what she does with the titular word in the song ''Yes,'' bending it upward until you can't tell whether it's a question or an answer.    Jaheim       This gruff but smooth R&B singer isn't yet a mainstream star, despite a pair of popular albums, but he should be. His latest underground hit is ''Something New,'' a light and sweet collaboration with Cam'ron. (Find it on any halfway-decent R&B mixtape.) Jaheim moans a tribute to a fickle but irresistible woman who ''still wants something new,'' and Cam'ron delivers his usual brusque pickup lines: ''Plus her eyes hot, 'Get in my drop'/ She said, 'Why?', I'm like, 'Why not?/ Where you wanna go, the Waffle House, IHOP?'''    Mountains       Brendon Anderegg and Koen Holtkamp recently released ''Mountains'' (Apestaartje), a mesmerizing -- and very quiet -- CD on which the main instruments are a softly plucked acoustic guitar, ambient electronic sounds and, to quote the liner notes, ''field recordings.'' It's not a CD likely to top the charts, but it has been a minor success. (The label recently sold out its initial run and has ordered more.) It's also, in an odd way, likely to be much more useful than most CD's you own. The densest book, the thorniest task, the hardest night, the gentlest morning: this diffident-but-never-bland disc can accompany just about any activity, or inactivity. You can lose yourself in the constantly shifting sounds (elegiac chords, glimmering tones) and textures (fine mists of white noise, whirring rhythms). Or, just as easily, you can ignore them.

At the Frick, as almost nowhere else, paintings, sculpture, bronzes, porcelains, silver and period furniture are displayed intimately in spaces for living, with no ropes or glass.

Cafe B -- With Bruno Jamais, the owner of Bruno Jamais Restaurant and Supper Club, as a new partner, the owners of Barbalùc have renamed their restaurant, dressed it up and hired Matteo Siliberti from Milan to prepare Mediterranean dishes: 135 East 65th Street, (212)774-1999.    Cercle Rouge -- David Féau, who was the last chef at Lutèce, will open his own boutique restaurant with a raw bar and a French bistro menu that also offers the chef's interpretation of New England clam chowder and chicken wings: 241 West Broadway (White Street), (212)226-6252.    Cookshop -- Vicki Freeman and Marc Meyer of Five Points in NoHo are about to add their rustic seasonal American food to Chelsea, where a grill, a rotisserie and a wood-burning oven will flavor the ingredients: 156 10th Avenue (20th Street), (212)924-4440.    Country -- If your idea of a country place is Versailles, then you will be right at home in Geoffrey Zakarian's balconied, silver-trimmed and ornamented dining room. David Rockwell's design was inspired by the 1907 Beaux-Arts décor of the Carlton hotel, once the Seville. The prix fixe menu of market-driven American fare will be served family style. Doug Psaltis, who worked for Alain Ducasse, is the chef: 90 Madison Avenue (29th Street), (212)889-7100.    The Diner -- More heavy duty than the average diner, this new spot, with inventive retro food, is backed by Marc Packer (Tao and Bolzano) and was designed by Morris Nathanson (Bolzano): 44 Ninth Avenue (14th Street), (212)627-2230.    D'Or Ahn -- This warmly modern 50-seat place owned by Lannie Ahn and serving Rachel Yang's Korean food is next to Tia Pol. It's the second spot on the block whose owner and chef are both women: 207 Tenth Avenue (22nd Street), (212)627-7777.    Earl Monroe's Restaurant  -- Riverbank State Park, overlooking the Hudson River, is the stunning setting for this spacious restaurant with a terrace. Christopher Faulkner, formerly the sous-chef at Town, will combine cuisines that are typical of Harlem and are long on seafood. The dining room becomes the Pearl Club for late-night jazz: Riverside Drive at 145th Street, (212)491-1500.    Eat with Your Bear Hands Cafe  -- This cafe in the Build-a-Bear Workshop store will welcome children, adults and stuffed animals with little hot dogs, chicken nuggets, sandwiches, salads and desserts: 565 Fifth Avenue (46th Street), (212)871-7080 or (800)560-2327.    Fatty Crab -- Adding another restaurant with Asian street food to the meatpacking district, Zak Pelaccio will be the chef at this 32-seat spot, named for one of his favorite places in Kuala Lumpur. He will remain in charge of 5 Ninth: 643 Hudson Street (Horatio Street),  (212)352-3590.    Ginger  -- Michelle Jean, who set Butter in NoLIta in motion, is opening this Chinese restaurant emphasizing healthful recipes by James Marshall, formerly at China Grill: 1400 Fifth Avenue (116th Street), (212)423-1111.

He will do the cooking: 43 East 7th Street, (212)982-3006.    Jovia -- A town house is the setting for Thalia and Stephen Loffredo's latest venture. Josh DeChellis of Sumile will create an American menu with an Italian accent: 135 East 62nd Street (no telephone yet).    Loft -- Part lounge, part Mediterranean, this fills a gap in a restaurant row that is becoming increasingly Mexican: 505 Columbus Avenue (84th Street), (212)362-6440.    Mo Pitkin's House of Satisfaction -- This spot, which just opened, combines Latino and Jewish dishes, offers entertainment and might be worthy of attention for its manischevitini, a near-cosmopolitan made with Manischevitz wine instead of cranberry juice: 34 Avenue A (Second Street), (212)777-5660, extension 21.    Ninja New York -- This $3.5 million Japanese newcomer has an executive chef, Michinobu Okamoto, leading a dozen chefs from Japan. The labyrinthine setting is designed to replicate a mountain village. Waiters in ninja garb will serve food that fuses Japanese with an international grab bag, some on tasting menus that go to $200: 25 Hudson Street (Duane Street), (212)274-8500.    Rosa Mexicano -- The former America has been converted to the third Rosa Mexicano, the second with a water wall: 9 East 18th Street, (212)533-3350 after Sept. 26.    Royal's Downtown  -- Alex McWilliams will shop at the Greenmarket for his seasonal menu: 215 Union Street (Henry Street),  (718)923-9866.    Thor -- Kurt Gutenbrunner's food is not strictly Austrian at this restaurant, which has just opened in the Rivington Hotel, 107 Rivington Street (Ludlow Street), (646)253-6700. Mr. Gutenbrunner is also expanding his services at the Neue Galerie on the Upper East Side, where he runs Café Sabarsky, adding Café Fledermaus on the lower level.

For this farce from Alessandro Blasetti, which opened at the Bijou Saturday, has so many things to recommend it that it hurts to have it get away.One striking point in its favor is the luxurious Sophia Loren, who is something to look at from any angle or any side. As the heroine who acts as a potent decoy for the professional activities of her father and brothers, who are thieves, she displays such a full and shapely figure that she makes it a pleasure to consider being robbed. And don't think the lady doesn't know it. With her, ambulating is an art. Leaning over is an esthetic manèuver. The signorina racks up quite a score.Another strong plus for the picture is Vittorio De Sica in the role of the heroine's amiable papa, who will steal anything he can see. Signor De Sica, in a straw hat that flares up in front and down behind, makes an utterly charming pinch-purse, a genuine adornment of his trade. His paternal regard for the signorina has feeling and quality.And Marcello Mastroianni, as an honest taxi driver who becomes involved and completely surrounded by the larcenous young lady and her old man, is a handsome and comical fellow. He, too, is a point for the film.But somewhere along toward the middle of this thoroughly slaphappy tale of the poor taxi driver's fruitless efforts to steer clear of the ubiquitous dame, a patiently watchful observer—trying desperately to keep his eyes on the actors and read the subtitles as they flash by, all at the same time—is likely to realize that the same things are happening over and over again. It is all like a squirrel in a squirrel-cage. It doesn't go anywhere—fast.This may be entirely satisfactory for those people who understand the wildly cascading Italian dialogue that appears to be full of lively gags. But for a viewer who has to do more reading than looking to know what's going on, this becomes just a wee bit annoying. And when Signorina Loren is on the screen, as she is through most of the picture, it becomes completely maddening. This sort of thing, if continued, could cause permanent psychological harm.Our advice to all non-Italian speakers who go to see this picture is: forget the subtitles. Forget the story. They're unimportant. Just watch the dame.

It is still another feature in which a night club serves as the background, and its hostess, one Sophie Leonard, inspires whatever tears and laughter with which the spectators may be wont to greet her heartaches and joys.Miss Tucker as Sophie Leonard plays her rôle with vehemence, pathos and a little fun, but she is handicapped by some of the lines in the dialogue. Her voice, however, is well registered, which was to be expected, but whether she has her face or her back turned to the audience her chanting is of the same volume.It is a picture of which one might say that those with whom Miss Tucker has found favor probably will appreciate in part. They may agree that the characters are abruptly varying in their moods and that the case of the daughter is one in a thousand. For, while a girl, educated abroad without knowing whence her mother obtained the necessary cash for her upbringing and her clothes, might feel keenly disappointed at discovering that her parent was officiating as the entertainer in a nocturnal resort, it is hardly probable that she would volley the epithets at her mother as Beth does at Sophie Leonard. And this flurry of fury takes place before a merry throng in the Honky Tonk Club.Good-natured, jovial Miss Tucker lifts her voice as the \\"Last of the Red-Hot Mommers\\" and also sings of being quite satisfied with her weight. During one sequence one anticipates that there is going to be a scene or so devoted to Miss Tucker doing her reducing exercises before the radio, but this stage entertainer foregoes the idea, permitting an amusing dog to obey the unseen owner of the voice by bending down and rolling over.In the course of a Pagliacci type of incident in the night club. Miss Tucker renders a melody. While it is being sung the flashes of her life's struggle come to the screen. This is quite effectively pictured, with glimpses of Sophie Leonard entering a pawnshop and finally becoming prosperous in the Honky Tonk. In another stretch Sophie Leonard picks up the photograph of the daughter who had reviled her, and the still picture not only comes to life but the words spoken by Beth in the night club are heard from the animated figure in the picture frame.It is the purpose in one passage to show that Beth has returned from Europe with a young snob, Jean Gilmore, and no time is wasted by this person in giving her opinion of Sophie's Harlem flat. Beth subsequently meets Freddie Leonard, who lives in marble halls, having as many bells as there are in a motion picture magnate's office. Yet this effete young man employs a stammering butler, who has difficulty in announcing callers and in telling the footman to send them up. His affliction is more painful to those who have to listen to him than to himself.This special night club hostess heartily dislikes working at night time and sleeping during the day. She is a home-loving person, who would sooner be cooking buckwheat cakes than entertaining the intoxicated throngs with song.A word or so from a wise friend, and Freddie becomes the salt of the earth and Beth returns to make her peace with her mother. In one of the closing scenes the girl becomes so enthusiastic over Sophie's singing that she herself chants the refrain. And then there is the not unexpected happy ending.There are several big scenes in the Honky Tonk, with young and old persons who have imbibed too freely of New York's synthetic libations. Their shouts and cries are interspersed with melody, such as one was apt to hear in the old days when roisterers hugged convenient lamp-posts.Lila Lee does quite well as Beth, and George Duryea passes muster in his portrayal of Freddie Gilmore.Music Week Medal Winners.Winners in the final interborough violin contests held last night in Steinway Hall, under the auspices of the New York Music Week Association, were Bernard Kundel of 1,321 Clinton Avenue, the Bronx, who won the senior class gold medal with a rating of 93 4-5 par cent. and David Sackson of 595 Beech Terrace, the Bronx, who won the open-class violin gold medal with 94 4-10. The judges were Hans Lange, Maximilian Pilzer, Henry Burck, Philip Littell and George Lehman. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"Sophie Tucker.
