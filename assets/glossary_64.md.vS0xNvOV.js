While she doesn't bring anything like Merman's roof-raising pizazz to the character's two big songs, \\"I Got Rhythm\\" and \\"Sam and Delilah,\\" she invests them with an engaging verve. The medley is accompanied by tidbits about the show's history, both on Broadway and in the movies, and a description of its plot.    At Tuesday evening's performance of an engagement that continues through Dec. 29, the singer also offered an extended medley of well-known movie songs that were not nominated for Academy Awards. As she amusingly pointed out, historically the motion picture academy has seemed resistant to nominating songs with the word \\"baby\\" in the title (\\"You Must Have Been a Beautiful Baby,\\" \\"My Baby Just Cares for Me\\" and \\"Baby Face\\" are examples) or songs that refer to specific cities (\\"Shuffle off to Buffalo,\\" \\"Flying Down to Rio,\\" \\"A Foggy Day,\\" \\"New York, New York\\").    Ms. Luft is accompanied by a quartet under the direction of the Broadway conductor Donald Pippin. If she is a very conventional nightclub performer who doesn't scale great musical or dramatic heights, her act is nevertheless infused with an appealing sweetness and sense of fun.

Church of St. Luke in the Fields, 487 Hudson Street, at Grove Street, West Village","excerpt":"5 p.m.; $15.    THE OPPOSITE OF PLEIN AIR  Sheri Warshauer paints pictures of wealthy people's apartments -- flat, color-rich, almost childish depictions that show a strong funny contrast between staid buildings and the funky art installed in them. The young Manhattan art collector Bill Previdi is among those paid this odd homage.  Jack the Pelican Presents, 487 Driggs Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn; noon to 6 p.m.    ART IN ANOTHER VILLAGE  The season's foliage is all underfoot now, but it's still worth taking a trip to the town of North Adams, Mass. A new exhibition by Cai Guo-Qiang opens at the gigantic Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art, or Mass MoCA, today; the centerpiece is a stop-motion tableau of nine cars flipping through the air, each supported by glass rods. Elsewhere in the building, photographs by Isabelle Hayeur prettify the town of North Adams itself: her digitally produced landscapes mix quaint postcardapproved scenes with trailers, factories and other signs of real life. Also on view: ''The Interventionists,'' a show of pranksters and fun politically motivated meddlers.  Mass MoCA, 87 Marshall Street, North Adams, Mass.; 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.; $10 general, free to members. Directions: www.massmoca.org.    Monday 12|13    GUIDANCE FOR THE HOLIDAYS  Manhattan User's Guide, whose free Web site that features daily tips for New Yorkers, will publish today ''50 Ways to End the Year,'' a special guide to 50 holiday events, with an emphasis on the arts. The site's taste ranges from the blessing of the animals at Central Presbyterian Church to the debut of a new print of Otto Preminger's ''Where the Sidewalk Ends.''  www.manhattanusersguide.com    CANADIAN SOCIAL SCENE  Broken Social Scene, a Canadian group, plays the first of three New York shows this week. Introspective without being narcissistic, it avoids the pitfalls of the emo crowd. And how many other pop bands include clarinets and trombones?  Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, Lower East Side; 8 p.m.; $20. (Also on Tuesday at Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan; 6:30 p.m., $42, and on Wednesday back at Bowery.)    CHRISTMAS WITH HARPSICHORD  Aulos Ensemble, a quintet devoted to original instrument performance, will be fittingly placed in the Medieval Sculpture Hall at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and joined by the baritone Sanford Sylvan in a performance of 16th- and 17th-century carols, including works by Rameau and Couperin. The museum's ornate miniature nativity scene in the hall dates from the 18th century -- slightly off-period, but we won't complain.  1000 Fifth Avenue, at 82nd Street; 6:30 and 8:30 p.m.; $60.    Tuesday 12|14    MERCE WITH KITES  Since 1964, Merce Cunningham's dance company has been performing ''Events'' -- programs that draw from the group's repertory but adapt it to the particular space in which they're being performed, the live music that accompanies them and even the audience that attends. Starting tonight, six ''Events'' will also interact with the work of contemporary visual artists. The first night, it's Jacqueline Matisse Monnier, a French sculptor whose work is obsessed with kites, so expect intrusions into the audience's air space. On Wednesday, it's the installation artist Robert Gober.  Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea; 7:30 p.m.; $42. (Through next Sunday.)    SCORSESE TALKS  ''Scorsese on Scorsese'' is a loving, 90-minute profile of perhaps the New Yorkiest of directors. The showing tonight, a world premiere, will be bookended with Mr. Scorsese's ''Last Waltz'' (1978) at 8 p.m., and ''Raging Bull'' (1980) at 11:30 p.m. and ''New York, New York'' (1977) at 3:30 a.m.Turner Classic Movies, 10 p.m. and 2 a.m.    DVD'S THIS WEEK: 'PARIS, TEXAS'  Today's the last gasp of the stocking-stuffer DVD releases: ''I, Robot'' hits stores (Fox Home Entertainment, $29.98), as does a repackaged ''Lord of the Rings'' ''extended edition,'' for those for whom the original seemed somehow too short (New Line Home Entertainment, $119.97 for a whopping 12 discs). ''Newlyweds: Nick & Jessica, the First Season'' (Paramount Home Video, $26.99) fits onto a comparatively slender two-DVD set. Wim Wenders's 1984 film ''Paris, Texas'' (Fox Home Entertainment, $9.98) has never been released on DVD; today, that awful oversight is corrected.    NOT HOME FOR THE HOLIDAYS  Three writers read fiction for a program called ''Home and Other Dislocations,'' among them Lynne Tillman, whose dark work is the perfect solace for the holiday-dispossessed.  Dixon Place, 258 Bowery, Lower East Side; 7 p.m.; $5.    Wednesday 12|15    PAUL MOONEY ON BROADWAY  The comedian Paul Mooney is a frequent guest on Comedy Central's ''Chappelle's Show''; behind the scenes he's written for Richard Pryor, ''In Living Color'' and ''Saturday Night Live.'' His appearances at Caroline's are when he works out his best new bits.  Caroline's on Broadway, 1626 Broadway, at 50th Street; 10 p.m.; $20.50. (Also Friday through next Sunday.)    A JAZZY NUTCRACKER  ''Nut/Cracked'' is -- please forgive -- ''The Nutcracker'' on crack: jazz settings of Tchaikovsky's score allow David Parker and the Bang Group to engage in high-dance comedy. Tonight's opening will be followed by a talk with Mr. Parker, the choreographer.  Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea; 7:30 p.m.; $20; $12 for members. (Through Dec. 22.)    REJECTS  Each month, ''The Rejection Show'' invites writers and artists to present works that have been refused publication. Tonight, the New Yorker cartoonists David Sipress and Matt Diffee will present some of their killed drawings; the event's curator, Jon Friedman, will show ''Santa Claus and the Jew,'' his short film about a trip down the wrong chimney that was rejected by the Sundance festival. And the writer Jonathan Ames will kvetch about his own repudiations.  P.S. 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village; 8 p.m.; $7.    Thursday 12|16    CD'S THIS WEEK: ASHANTI  Ashanti, who represents the sweeter, more R&B-inflected side of the family formerly known as Murder Inc., releases ''Concrete Rose'' ($13.98, Def Jam); Funkadelic's too-trippy ''Cosmic Funkers'' (Atom, $24.99 gets a domestic rerelease; and Synthphony, a New York-based electronica label, puts out ''Synthphony REMIXed!,'' by the German D.J. Harald Schoger. (Synthphony, $14).    PLAIN JANE  The songwriter Jane Siberry was an indie-pop secret in the late 80's who won a devoted following as she reinvented the sort of mysterious, allusive music Kate Bush pioneered. Ms. Siberry alienated some of her fans in the 90's, when she took a slight turn into New Age. Tonight the spiritually inclined and deeply earnest Ms. Siberry plays the second of three intimate nights at Joe's Pub.  425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village; 7 p.m.; $25. (Also Wednesday and Friday.)    DUELING SCROOGES  You've got at least three productions of ''A Christmas Carol'' to choose from. Tickets remain for only a few hourlong performances at the Auditorium at Equitable, while over at the 13th Street Repertory Company, an abundance of tickets remain for its 90-minute performance. The best bargain, with tickets still available, is the Personal Space Theatrics production at the Bernie West Theater -- though with 22 songs it runs to a full two hours.  Theatreworks/USA, Auditorium at Equitable. 787 Seventh Avenue, between 51th and 52nd Streets; $25. 13th Street Rep, 50 West 13th Street, Greenwich Village; 7 p.m., $12 to $15. Personal Space Theatrics, Bernie West Theater, 17 Lexington Avenue, between 22nd and 23rd Streets ; 8 p.m.; $10 to $15.    Friday 12|17    HIGH SCHOOL STORY  Yes, it's a high school musical production. But it's La Guardia High School, the alma mater of Isaac Mizrahi and Jennifer Aniston, with the school's 45-member orchestra accompanying the appropriately aged cast members in ''West Side Story.'' Gang war in a Manhattan school never looked so professional.  La Guardia Concert Hall, Amsterdam Avenue at 65th Street; 7:30 p.m.; $10 to $15. (Also on Saturday.)    MOVIES THIS WEEKEND: A SEA OF FILM  Dive in: In the wake of Wes Anderson's ''Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou,'' the weekend is awash in biography-based, nautically titled films. But ''The Sea Inside,'' the story of a quadriplegic who fought for the right to die, should absolutely not be confused with ''Beyond the Sea,'' the sanitized Bobby Darin biopic. In limited release, ''Open My Heart,'' an Italian film about a prostitute and her possessive sister, opens at the Quad Cinema tonight. Tim Burton's ''Nightmare Before Christmas'' (1993) plays at the Sunshine Cinema at midnight tonight and tomorrow night -- nice timing, as its influence on the current ''Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events'' is palpable.    A DANCE SURPRISE  For the last two months, a group of young choreographers have workshopped together; tonight, they'll make their experiments -- which are still being poked and prodded -- public for the Kitchen's Dance in Progress performance. Chosen by the curator and choreographer Sarah Michelson, the performers will reflect her taste in always vigorous, sometimes rude, and often cinematic dance.  The Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea; 8 p.m.; $12. (Also on Saturday.)    TRIAL PERFORMANCE  Phoenix Theater Ensemble -- created in September by five members of the Jean Cocteau Repertory, a small company devoted to classics, -- introduces its first production tonight, André Gide and Jean-Louis Barrault's adaptation of Kafka's ''Trial.'' There have been no fussy present-day updatings, no write-ins of Johnnie Cochran as the persecuted character K.'s lawyer: just the pure, mazey nightmare of Kafka.  The Mint Space, 311 West 43rd Street, Manhattan; 8 p.m.; $15. (Through Jan. 9.)    Saturday 12|18    LAST CHANCE FOR LOVE  ''Freestyle Love Supreme,'' a 60-minute live music, comedy, hip-hop amalgamation, stars six men in their mid-20's, professionals in the art of free-style rhyme. Its host, Anthony Veneziale, is a whirling comic M.C. who manages to involve the audience without humiliating them. Freestyle closes its run of frantic improvisations tonight.  Ars Nova Theater, 511 West 54th Street, Manhattan; 8 p.m.; $20.    BURNING MAN  The photographer Gabe Kirchheimer brings a bit of heat to winter with his documentation of Burning Man, the wild festival that takes place each summer in the Nevada desert. The one-night exhibition takes place nightclub-style, with wine and live music, and is a benefit for Art Start, which conducts the Arts in the Shelters program, intended to build self-esteem, teach expression and provide mentoring for homeless youth in New York City.  20 Greene Street, SoHo; 7:30 p.m. to 1 a.m.; $30 suggested donation.    KID FRIENDLY PLAY  ''Extraordinary,'' a 60-minute show geared to the demanding 2-12 set, opens today. It's the sweet story of a boy and his deaf cousin who go in search of her hearing in the Land of Quiet. So sweet! Also this weekend: an adaptation of ''Puss in Boots,'' starring a talking cat who helps his owner, a knight, win the heart of a princess of the castle. The children's tales, with their white-knight gender roles, might seem a bit dated -- but hey, they've got a talking cat!  ''Extraordinary'': Vital Theater Company at the McGinn Cazale Theater, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street; 1 and 3 p.m.; $15. (Through Feb 6.)''Puss in Boots'': John Houseman Studio Theater, 452 West 42nd Street; 2 and 8 p.m.; $25. (Through next Sunday.)   The Guide"},{"year":"2005","title":"SUNDAY 1|9    THE OLD CLARINET  The Aston Magna Foundation, a group devoted to the use of period instruments, produces a festival each summer in the Berkshires. Today, in a more subway-accessible spot, it's playing a program that includes Mozart's Clarinet Quintet in A (K. 581). It will be joined by Eric Hoeprich, who performs using his collection of 18th- and 19th-century clarinets. First-come- first-served tickets are available an hour before the concert, although for those without, the performance can be heard in the Garden Court.

TUESDAY 1|11    PRODUCER CREDITS  An unusual cast change occurs today in ''The Producers,'' now in its fourth year on Broadway; Richard Kind and Alan Ruck, who worked together on the TV show ''Spin City,'' take the leads.

CD'S: ACCORDIONS AND ROMANTICS  Motion Trio, an ensemble of accordion players, releases its first CD today, ''Pictures From the Street'' (Asphalt Tango, $19.98). The threesome use specially built accordions with a greater range and richer timbre than the average polka squeezebox. The cool-kid faves Fiery Furnaces put out a 10-song EP sensibly called ''EP'' (Sanctuary, $8.98): it's a collection of singles and B-sides. Trembling Blue Stars, an underappreciated, gloomy-pretty gang of English romantics, releases ''Seven Autumn Flowers'' (Bar/None, $16.98).    PRINCESS TELL-ALL  The child-of-Hollywood-slash-actress-slash-author Carrie Fisher chats and reads from ''The Best Awful.''

Previews begin.  Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, East Village; 8 p.m.; $25 to $45.    WEDNESDAY 1|12    JEWISH FILMS  Instead of, say, running all of Woody Allen's films consecutively, the New York Jewish Film Festival, which starts today, presents 29 films by an array of directors. But ''Waiting for Woody Allen,'' in which two Hasidic fellows talk philosophy, has its New York premiere next Sunday.  Schedule: www.thejewishmuseum.org. (Through Jan. 27.)    ART DOWNTOWN  Without the pomp and recognizable names of Chelsea, and without the self-conscious stylings of Williamsburg, the small TriBeCa gallery world is a quiet oddity. The scene's gotten a little bit traditional since the adventurous123 Watts Gallery left to merge with a Chelsea gallery, but the bustling nonprofit Art in General is an often overlooked joy; downstairs a gold-leafed room by Jaime Ruiz Otis turns out to be a TriBeCa-appropriate comment on Nafta. ApexArt also flies under the radar, but its new exhibition features five Iranian artists whose work looks remarkably cosmopolitan. A number of downtown galleries stay open until 9 p.m. on the second Wednesday of the month.  Information: www.cherylpelavin.com/TAGfull.html.Art in General, 79 Walker Street, TriBeCa. ApexArt, 291 Church Street, TriBeCa (closes at 6 p.m.).    CRANKY SISTERS  Last year the Atlantic Theater Company inaugurated a second stage -- devoted to new and perhaps difficult plays -- with ''The Hiding Place,'' by Jeff Whitty, who wrote the book for ''Avenue Q.''

Atlantic 453, 453 West 16th Street, Chelsea; 8 p.m.; $20; members, $15. (Through Jan. 30.)    THURSDAY 1|13    DVD: SCISSORING BACK TO AMERICA  This week the wry pop tartlets the Scissor Sisters (Elton John's favorites) release a DVD of live concert film and videos, ''We Are Scissor Sisters and So Are You'' (Universal, $11.98). It includes the entire performance at the Brighton Dome in London last summer, a complete collection of the group's videos to date and a 30-minute documentary of the band's electroclash rise and East Village roots.    INTERN SCANDALS  13P (the name stands for 13 Playwrights) banded together last year as a collective; its newest production, ''Aphrodisiac,'' is a Beltway scandal piece by Rob Handel. In it, a Congressman is suspected in the disappearance of an intern; his children take on the roles of key players in Washington's other sex scandals. It stars Jennifer Dundas, who has many credits to her name, but most memorably young Lilly Berry in ''The Hotel New Hampshire.''  P.S. 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village; 8 p.m.; $15. (Through Jan. 30.)    LOVE AMONGST THE LIEDER  ''Top 10 People of the Millennium Sing Their Favorite Schubert Lieder'' is the latest play -- with the latest overly long title -- by Alec Duffy. In this outing, the fake-bearded and occasionally cross-dressed Top 10 argue about the meaning of life, and Marx hits on Einstein. Opens tonight.  Bank Street Theater, 155 Bank Street, West Village; 8 p.m.; $15. (Through Jan. 30.)    FRIDAY 1|14    FILMS: ACTION AND INACTION  New releases: ''Elektra,'' starring Jennifer Garner in the sequel to ''Daredevil,'' is pure wish fulfillment for those who have bought the equally trashy ''Tomb Raider'' films on DVD. Last year's ''Emile,'' starring Ian McKellen as a mild Canadian returning home, plays at the Quad Cinema. ''Appleseed,'' a dystopic anime film with a techno soundtrack, opens nationally at a limited number of theaters. At the Angelika, ''The Chorus,'' France's submission to the Oscars, is a ''Mr. Holland's Opus'' for the boys' choir set. ''Scarface'' is the midnight movie at the Sunshine Cinema through next Sunday.  Quad Cinema, 34 West 13th Street, Greenwich Village. Angelika Film Center, Mercer and Houston Streets, Greenwich Village. Sunshine Cinema, 143 East Houston Street, Lower East Side.    DELAYED NEW YORK PREMIERE  Robert Ward, whose opera ''The Crucible'' made its debut in 1961, was commissioned in the 70's by the New York City Opera to compose ''Claudia Legare,'' a reworking of ''Hedda Gabler'' set in South Carolina. But with the vogue for postmodern music, Mr. Ward's more conservative style fell out of favor, and the work was not staged in New York. Until now, that is, when his overlooked opera finds a brief home in a church basement.  Dicapo Opera Theater, at St. Jean Baptiste Church, 184 East 76th Street, Manhattan; 8 p.m.; $47.50. (Also next Sunday and Jan. 21-23.)    MORE COLLABORATION  Arranged ''conversations'' seem to be all the rage right now; tonight the director Jonathan Demme and the songwriter Steve Earle commune at the New York Public Library. Mr. Demme has recently directed a video for Mr. Earle.  New York Public Library, Celeste Bartos Forum, Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street; 7 p.m.; $10; members, $7.

Akenson, traces the long line of political involvement by country songwriters. From Gene Autry's service in World War II to the Dixie Chicks, the book takes on patriotism and dissent from the Civil War to the war in Iraq.  University Press of Kentucky; $35.    TO JERSEY AND BACK AGAIN  The stand-up comic and song-belter Kim Cea performs a one-night show to stay fresh after leaving the Off Broadway revue ''Newsical.'' Ms. Cea plays it old school; she recently had a run at Caesar's Palace in Atlantic City, and compared with that, playing for a New York audience will be a piece of cake.  Studio 54 Upstairs, 254 West 54th Street, Manhattan; 10:30 p.m.; $20 to $40.    TRUE SOUTH  The highlight of the two-gallery exhibition ''Cracker: Rethinking the American South'' is the work of four young photographers: Cary Clifford's silver-gelatin prints offer an exotic view of that mysterious region of the country.

Indeed, you might wonder why it's so hard for your children to express themselves sometimes after you spend an hour with the Potato People. Produced by the Theater Beyond Words in Ontario, Canada, formerly the Canadian Mime Theater, the company has toured extensively through its own country, the United States and even the Soviet Union, where potatoes are almost a natural resource. The main characters are indolent Poppa Potato, Momma Potato in her curlers and blue slippers, and Nancy Potato, an overgrown 3-year-old. Momma and Poppa are a domestic Laurel and Hardy, providing a lot of self-mocking fun, though Nancy garners a round of giggles when she blows her nose like a trumpet. The Martin Theater at the Dalton School holds 500 people, so the stage is close and seating is democratic. There is no intermission and no refreshments are served. Strollers can be left in the school's central lobby. Tickets are $7.50.  The Ice Studio  1034 Lexington Avenue, at 73d Street (212) 535-0304 Recommended ages: 4 and up    Archie Walker, a former skater with the Ice Capades, is the effusive owner of this dance-studio-size indoor rink, which has been here 14 years. The smallish rink, with its large windows and ballet barres, is separated by a glass wall from the reception area, where wooden benches draw parents who aren't up to skating but who want to watch and relax. On a recent Saturday, the studio was not at all crowded, and the intimate atmosphere was one of calm civility: just right for the Upper East Side. Lessons, a coat check and a restroom are available. Hours for general skating are 8:30 to 10 P.M. on Thursdays","excerpt":"5 to 6 P.M. and 8:30 to 10 P.M. on Fridays, and noon to 1 P.M. and 5:15 to 6:15 P.M. on weedends. On Sundays, an additional session from 3:15 to 4:15 P.M. is available. Admission: $5 for one hour; $6 for an hour and a half. Skate rental: $2.75. 'Music Under the Big Top'  Avery Fisher Hall Lincoln Center (212) 704-2100 or (212) 874-6770 (Centercharge) Recommended ages: 6 to 12 Tomorrow     As part of the Happy Concerts for Young People, series the Little Orchestra Society of Manhattan is presenting the No Elephant Circus, a troupe of jugglers, dancers, acrobats and clowns that tours with symphony orchestras. Under the baton of Dino Anagnost, who takes the time to talk to the young audience about the music the orchestra is playing, the wily circus performers eat fire, walk on stilts and clown on unicyles. They just don't have any elephants. No matter. The rousing circus-theme music, by such composers as Copland, Dvorak and Bizet, excites the audience just as well, conjuring up images of cotton candy, calliopes, sawdust and far-flung aerialists. Tickets to the 50-minute programs, which are performed without intermissions, are $15 to $28, at the Avery Fisher Hall box office or through the telephone numbers above. Fisher Hall is a worldly yet comfortable place, with restrooms on each floor, elevators, two restaurants and a snack bar selling muffins, cookies, sandwiches and drinks in the lobby before and after the performances, which begin at 11 A.M. and 1 P.M. Children dress up in suits and patent-leather shoes, but casual clothes fit in, too.  'Walt Disney's World on Ice: Mickey Mouse Diamond Jubilee'  Radio City Music Hall (212) 247-4777 or (212) 307-7171 Recommended ages: 2 and up Through Sunday    Mickey may have starred in more than 130 films and hundreds of stage, television and video events, but at 60 years old he is just approaching his prime. His low-key, almost modest manner has not changed since his debut in \\"Steamboat Willie.\\" In fact, he seems a bit shy at this current event at Radio City celebrating his birthday. Dressed in red satin pants, a black topcoat with tails and mouse skates, Mickey amiably shares the limelight with Goofy, Pluto, Donald, Daisy and Minnie. There is certainly enough stage time, with 2 acts and 11 short scenes, for Mickey's cohorts and other Disney characters to skate in skits from such stories as \\"Steamboat Willie,\\" \\"Sorcerer's Apprentice\\" and \\"Puppy Love.\\" Though most of the audience may not have seen the first \\"Puppy Love,\\" which made its debut in 1933, they will appreciate seeing how Mickey and Minnie first met. For the most part, children are riveted for the two hours as they bask in the aura of Mickey Mouse, which is important because many acts lack complete narratives or theatrical direction. The scenes in the second act are slightly more cohesive and dramatic. In \\"The Land Above the Clouds,\\" for example, a giant's moving hand makes the children suitably uneasy, if not impressed. What is lacking is made up for by the lavish pure Walt Disney sets and costumes, as well as the computerized lighting that adds tension to many scenes. A 20-minute intermission is welcome, if only to note the bustle at the souvenir stands in the lobby, where the recession seems to have been thoroughly snuffed out. Strollers are checked by the kindly ushers, and elevators can whisk you upstairs if the main staircase is too daunting. Tickets are $14 and $18, and show times are at 2:30 and 7 P.M. today; at 11 A.M., 2:30 and 7 P.M. tomorrow, and at 11 A.M. and 2:30 P.M. on Sunday.  North Meadow Recreation Center  Central Park 96th Street and Central Park West entrance (212) 348-4867 Recommended ages: 8 and up Saturdays and Sundays    Follow the concrete path midway through the park to a pair of low, red-brick buildings sitting on a slope. The North Meadow Recreation Center is in the building on the left, but you have to walk through an army of bright green park vehicles in the courtyard to get to its front door. The Central Park Conservancy and the New York City Department of Recreation and Parks sponsor the center's weekday and weekend activities for boys and girls; on Saturdays, Tony Velez is in charge; on Sundays, Ron Green runs the show. Depending on the weather and the number of people who come and what their mood is, the day could consist of football (touch or tackle), basketball, kite flying, paddle ball and handball on the clean athletic fields and handball courts. Inside the airy one-room center, with its trussed ceiling and large windows, quieter pursuits like Ping-Pong, bingo, board games and macrame take place. The center provides all the equipment free. No food is available, and on the weekends after dark there is no formal arrangement to escort people out of the park, though most walk home at the same time or in groups. The hours are 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. on the weekends and 3:15 to 5:45 P.M. on weekdays. Registration is necessary, and can be done any day. Keep in Mind   STORYTELLING, with Gerald Fierst, who is to tell original tales of humor, fantasy and mystery for children ages 4 to 8 at the West End Gate, across the street from Columbia University, on Broadway at 113th Street. The show is at 1 P.M. tomorrow. Admission: $5. Lunch is available before or after the program. Information: (212) 662-8830.   STORYBOOK PLAYHOUSE, featuring the screenings of classic children's books. Tomorrow the programs are to be \\"The Muppet Musicians of Bremen,\\" with Kermit the Frog narrating; \\"Raggedy Ann and Andy and the Camel With the Wrinkled Knees,\\" where the two dolls fall into Looneyville, and \\"Corduroy,\\" a story of a teddy bear who waits for someone to take him home. All to be shown tomorrow at 12:30 and 3:30 P.M. at the Museum of Broadcasting, 1 East 53d Street. Admission: $4.50 for adults and $2.50 for children under 13. Information: (212) 752-7684.   \\"HOW THE WORLD GOT WISDOM,\\" a celebration of African folklore featuring four African tales with music and dance. At the Hartley House Theater, 413 West 46th Street. Performances are at 1 and 3:30 P.M., Saturdays and Sundays through March 17. Admission is $6. Reservations: (212) 666-1716.   \\"ONCE UPON A MATTRESS,\\" a musical based on \\"The Princess and the Pea,\\" the story of the hypersensitive princess who cannot sleep at night because a pea is beneath her mattress.
