TITAN -- The latest installment in the long-running story of whether Richard A. Grasso, former chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, will be allowed to keep his copious compensation is scheduled Wednesday, when arguments will be heard about two of Mr. Grasso's appeals. One appeal seeks the removal of the presiding judge, Justice Charles E. Ramos of New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan, who has ruled that Mr. Grasso return up to $100 million of his pay package. The other seeks to overturn the judge's ruling that he decide without a jury whether Mr. Grasso's pay was reasonable. Eliot Spitzer, the New York State attorney general and governor-elect, sued Mr. Grasso in 2004.    HOME RANGE -- This week will bring snapshots of housing and the overall economy. The National Association of Realtors will release its report on existing-home sales for the month of October (Tuesday), followed by the Commerce Department's report on new-home sales for October (Wednesday). Both figures are expected to drop. The Federal Reserve will release its beige book, which summarizes current economic conditions (Wednesday). And automakers will report vehicle sales for November (Friday).    HO-HO OR HO-HUM? -- Leading retailers will release final sales reports for November on Thursday, and Wall Street will be watching to see how consumers are behaving, especially in light of the slowdown in the housing market. Wal-Mart sounded a cautionary note last week when it estimated that same-store sales fell 0.1 in November, more than expected.

This radically different course for United States economic policy, aimed at curing both economic stagnation and inflation, was first prescribed in 1971 at an international monetary conference held at the University of Bologna in Italy by Prof. Robert Mundell of Columbia University - a conference that has recently been resurrected by John Brooks in The New Yorker.   Those present at Bologna, including this columnist, vividly recall the shock that ran around the long rectangular conference table when Professor Mundell introduced what was to become known as supply-side economics, or, more exactly, Reaganomics.   During the creation of the revolution in economic theory that was wrought in the 1930's by John Maynard Keynes, who saw the solution to mass unemployment in lower taxes and higher expenditures, there was a popular paraphrase of the poet Shelley: ''Bliss was it in that Keynesian dawn to be alive, but to be young was very heaven.''

Basic Books/HarperCollins. $22.50   How do giraffes sleep? A 4-year-old asked Seymour Papert this question when she learned that he had grown up in South Africa. \\"My dog cuddles her head when she sleeps and so do I,\\" the child said, \\"but the giraffe's head is so far away.\\"   Although Mr. Papert doesn't seem to have been able to answer the question, it prompted him to think about what he calls a Knowledge Machine, which would permit a curious child to explore an entire world of learning. Such an instrument will not be long in coming, Mr. Papert predicts in \\"The Children's Machine: Rethinking School in the Age of the Computer.\\" We must only begin to teach children a form of nonprint literacy that he defines in contrast to what he calls letteracy. We must only make better use of computers.    This message will not exactly start fingers rapping and toes tapping. As the author himself admits, computers in most schools have so far served as expensive flashcard systems. These schools have tended to confine the machines to computer labs, using them as objects of study instead of as tools for learning.   But Mr. Papert has a vision. He is a former colleague of the Swiss child-development theorist Jean Piaget and an expert on artificial intelligence and learning theory who teaches at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and he believes that more learning is involved in the playing of video games than educators have begun to acknowledge.   What is needed is a new theory of learning, or what he calls mathetics (from the Greek mathematikos, or \\"disposed to learn\\"), a word he introduced in his earlier book, \\"Mindstorms: Children, Computers, and Powerful Ideas.\\" Mathetics, Mr. Papert believes, will show that most struggling children, far from having learning disabilities, simply learn in different ways. Like the subjects of Claude Levi-Strauss's anthropological study \\"The Savage Mind,\\" children when learning practice bricolage, an almost untranslatable French word meaning roughly the art of tinkering or making do with materials at hand.   Mr. Papert illustrates this point by relating his own experience of using an interest in etymology to overcome a block against learning the names and identities of flowers. By a similar process of tinkering with disparate ideas, he invented the now-well-known computer language Logo, which he has used in elementary-school classrooms to study how children learn and think.   His experience has convinced him that many children, particularly girls, learn kinesthetically rather than abstractly. Computers, he believes, can support this tendency by supplying feedback and building confidence. Computers can fight what he calls androcentrism, or a male bias in technological culture. All we have to do now is decentralize our top-heavy educational system, and redesign it from the bottom up.    Now, some readers who lived through the 1960's will no doubt flinch at the echoes here of a revolution that largely failed. And Mr. Papert's own program appears flawed in a several respects. Most tantalizingly, he often fails to illustrate precisely how Logo helps children to learn. Although he introduces many concrete examples, they sometimes trail off into vagueness. For instance, he rhapsodizes about how a mathematically inclined boy collaborated with a physically graceful classmate to make Logo-programmed figures move more fluently, but he doesn't give us the dimmest clue to how this teaming up worked in practical application.   And for an educator concerned with the logic of thought, he has a scary disrespect for precise and succinct language. \\"Why is there no word in English for the art of learning?\\" he asks at the beginning of the chapter in which he eventually introduces the word mathetics. He then goes on in three 200-word paragraphs to pose the same question in several different ways and to conclude with this sentence: \\"The how-to-do-it literature in the constructivist subculture is almost as strongly biased to the teacher side as it is in the instructionist subculture.\\" Such prose lulls the mind to sleep. Maybe it's not quite time to rename literacy letteracy and relegate print culture to left field.   Still, \\"The Children's Machine\\" is often bold and adventurous. Mr. Papert's point is not that the map of computer education has been drawn and laid out to follow, but rather that the possibilities have been glimpsed in a way comparable to the 59-second flight at Kitty Hawk, N.C., and that imaginative teachers should now be asking, \\"How high the moon?\\"    If some of Mr. Papert's examples are vaporous, others are wonderfully concrete. In a section called \\"Kitchen Math,\\" he describes the inventiveness of nonabstract thinkers like a cook who measures out two-thirds of a cup and a half of flour by forming a pie of the latter amount, dividing it into thirds, returning one of them to the flour bag and using what's left over.   Similarly inspired is Mr. Papert's comparison of President George Bush's master plan on education to the Soviet Union's command economy: \\"His remedies were the remedies the bureaucratic mind proposes indiscriminately for every situation: Issue orders","excerpt":"tighten controls. Weakness in results can mean only that people are lazy and that a good system of tests will expose them.\\"   Just think: Mr. Papert's solution to America's educational ills lies in breaking down the centralized bureaucracy and holding a market-economy competition.

But while all of Halloweenland is celebrating, the Pumpkin King is forlorn. Wandering alone, bored with his job, he finds that his life lacks meaning. So begins the director Tim Burton's latest exploration of isolation, misguided passions and misperception, this time in the form of Jack Skellington. A pin-striped, pencil-thin puppet with a bat for a bow tie, Skellington moves through his world by virtue of a highly technical animation form called stop motion in the film \\"Tim Burton's Nightmare Before Christmas.\\"\\n\\nAlienation has been at the heart of several Burton films, most notably \\"Edward Scissorhands\\" and \\"Beetlejuice,\\" and on the periphery of others, like \\"Batman.\\" But with \\"Nightmare,\\" Mr. Burton spins this theme into a dark fairy tale that, with the help of three-dimensional animation, seems to exist somewhere between fantasy and a hyper-reality.

His half brother was Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree, the successful and romantic actor-manager who owned Her Majesty's Theater and starred there in performances so realistic that live sheep and rabbits frolicked on the stage forest in \\"As You Like It.\\" Beerbohm Tree was also the first Henry Higgins in George Bernard Shaw's \\"Pygmalion.\\" Max grew up in a world of suppers in the Cafe Royal, stage doors and Art for Art's Sake. He was quite popular at school, he wrote, but, \\"It is Oxford that has made me insufferable.\\" No doubt that was where he became a dandy. Desmond MacCarthy describes in \\"Memories\\" the young Max strolling down Piccadilly: \\"I was walking behind that high hat with its deep mourning band. It was perched above a very long, dark top coat with an astrakhan collar. . . . In his gloved hand this figure held an ebony stick with an ivory knob which, wonderful to say, has not yet been lost. I remember noting the little black curl on the nape of his neck like a drake's tail. His walk was slow and tranquil, such as one could hardly imagine ever breaking into a run.\\" Visitors to London's National Portrait Gallery may see a painting by William Nicholson of Max looking exactly like this.

The faculty and staff of the Division of Infectious Diseases and the entire faculty and housestaff of the Department of Medicine and the School of Medicine are deeply saddened and mourn the passing of our young dear friend and beloved colleague, Dr. Geoffrey D. Chazen, Clinical Assistant Professor of Medicine at NYU. He was a very bright critical thinker, a dedicated caring physician, and an outstanding teacher. Geoffrey was a very fine role model for students and housestaff who admired him greatly. He was equally at home in the research laboratory and at the bedside. As a former Fellow of the National Institutes of Health, he made the important discovery that IL-7 was a potent growth factor which stimulated cellular as well as humoral immune responses. At NYU he created and directed an academic and successful section on Geographic Medicine. We will miss our colleague, a highly respected, popular, scientific physician, clinician and teacher. We extend our deepest condolences to his wife Jamie, his children Zoe and Charlotte, his mother Barbara, his father Dr. Eric Chazen, and his entire family. Noel L. Cohen, M.D., Interim Dean H.

They have lived for 10 years in a two-bedroom apartment, for which they pay $325 a month rent. The price of their new home is $39,900, and their mortgage costs will be about $500 a month, including taxes.   The subsidy program, Section 235, will end in March, but many of the low-interest loans are still available.

That is far from the record, for in a New York match a single bid once took 25 minutes and the deal almost an hour.   There is no perfect solution, since it is hard to separate slow play by one partnership from that of their opponents, but the organizers have done much to improve the situation in recent years.  In team matches a time-limit is imposed, with penalties that usually involve the point-score or disciplinary action. A variation that proved successful in the 1981 world championship was to threaten to bar a partnership from one or more sessions of play. This duly alarmed the snails, and the penalty did not have to be imposed.
