Both artists are committed to representing nature in its many variations.    Their work may be seen through Oct. 9 in the Fine Arts Gallery at Westchester Community College in Valhalla.     Mr. Padula shoots his pictures of the earth's surface from his Citabria plane -- a high-flying bird's eye view -- resulting in forms that appear abstract. Ms. Johann's training at the National Academy of Design and Pratt Institute, where she received her bachelor of fine arts degree, is apparent in her sure hand with composition, content and color.    The college is at 75 Grasslands Road. For more information, call 785-6700.    Shofar Making Session      The sound made by blowing on a shofar, or ram's horn, is meant to command attention, and it certainly does. This biblical instrument, whose piercing call is an indigenous component of Jewish holiday services, is sometimes compared to the trumpet, but its limited tonal range is no Harry James solo.     Once done only by a select few, the craft of making shofars is now practiced worldwide, and a free mini-shofar factory for children is scheduled  next Saturday from 4 to 6 P.M. at Beth El Synagogue in New Rochelle.     Identifying the animal that the horn comes from, its religious significance, the respect and kindness to which the animal is entitled when seeking a horn and the actual making of a horn, which the children may take home, fill the two-hour session.    After assisting in a demonstration, each child will be given a horn to work on by removing the cartilage, sawing off the tip, drilling out the hollow, sanding and polishing the finished horn.     Beth El is at North Avenue and Northfield Road. To register, call 235-2700, extension 247.    Orienteering Meet      How not to get lost in the woods is the ultimate goal of the sport of orienteering, but finding one's way in alien territory is also a pleasurable experience.    The Western Connecticut Orienteering Club will hold one of its meets next Sunday at 10 A.M. at the Ward Pound Ridge Reservation in Cross River. Beginners, experts, young and old, are encouraged to take part. Instruction will be available from Erin Taylor, who will distribute maps and lend compasses to those who do not bring their own.     A participant can choose to hike the marked trail or, by reading the detailed map and referring to the compass, take a route less traveled. People who wish to compete by running or walking fast in the shortest time may do so.    The fee for individuals is $5, $9 for families. To register, call Ms. Taylor at (203) 846-9816.    Hispanic Celebration      Hispanic Heritage Month will be observed by Services Education and Resources of Westchester of White Plains with an evening of tangos, Argentinian dance, song, a silent auction of Latin American fine art, finger foods and mate -- the national drink of Argentina, made from South American holly leaves. The event will take place on Friday at 8 P.M. in the White Plains Woman's Club, 305 Ridgeway Avenue.     Held as a fund-raiser for scholarships and services to children from  kindergarten through high school and those attending Westchester colleges and technical schools, the evening includes tango lessons.     From 8 to 10:30 P.M., Las Pampas Tango and Folklore Argentino Ensemble and Orchestra will perform dances and songs, followed by the silent auction and food service. At 10:30 tango lessons will begin, and the floor will be open for dancing until past midnight. Tickets are $70 a person or $130 a couple. For reservations, call 681-0996.    Author at Library      The Italian-American Association of New Rochelle is sponsoring a talk by Jay Sommer on Tuesday at 7 P.M. in the New Rochelle Public Library at 1 Library Plaza.     In World War II, Mr. Sommer, who was born in Czechoslovakia, escaped from the Nazi Chepel Labor Camp outside Budapest and spent time in an Italian refugee camp in Cremona, where he learned of the many Italians who harbored Jews and other refugees from the Holocaust.    In 1981 Mr. Sommer was named National Teacher of the Year and later served on President Reagan's National Commission on Excellence in Education. In 1993 he traveled to Russia for the American Federation of Teachers, lecturing to Russian teachers in Moscow on pedagogy and democracy. Currently, he teaches Russian and Hebrew at Fairfield University in Fairfield. His self-published book, ''Journey to the Golden Door: A Survivor's Tale,'' is in its fourth printing since 1994 and will be available for purchase. For more information, call 632-7878.

Now, the sales staffs of those magazines and networks could certainly make a case for the efficiency of such purchases, Mr.  Maneloveg explained to the securities analysts attending the ninth annual Paine Webber Mitchell Hutchins Conference on the Outlook for the Media.

Mr. Richardson and Ms. Roxas made each shift of power clear in this ballet pas de deux about two lovers who cannot be together or apart.    First performed in 1966, the duet is danced to a dated score by Lee Hoiby and makes use of some conventions that are nearly as dated, freshened by inventive passages like the sad and soaring floor work at the end of the dance. It is a ballet that needs expressive performers, and it got them. Ms. Roxas's attack and delicately intense way of seeming to inhabit each moment made her the more overtly dramatic of the two. Her Eve was a woman of understated self-knowing passion.    Mr. Richardson expressed his character's more instinctual nature through the line of his body, long and lyrical at times then jagged, moved by one muted, slow-building explosion after another. Two sensuous dancers, Mr. Richardson and Ms. Roxas were also a good-looking pair.

She was born in New York City, attended Barnard College and studied at the Art Students League of New York. She married Mr. Leeds in 1928. She was a Renaissance woman, independent thinker and a free spirit with great intellectual curiosity. A muchadmired and sought-after beauty, she became a recognized sculptress and painter. During the '30s, she socialized and entertained amidst the leading playwrights, authors and artists of her time. A highlight of her creativity was when in 1939 she collaborated with Norman Bel Geddes in creating the ''Futurama'', the General Motors exhibit that was among the most-visited sites of the 1939 World's Fair in New York. When the United States entered World War II, she completed pilot training and became a WASP (Women's Airforce Service Pilot). At the conclusion of the War, she married her second husband, Harry Schwarzschild, who had been a Naval Commander on destroyer duty in the North Atlantic, and moved from New York to Richmond, where she was to spend the rest of her life. There she was very active in the community as a fundraiser, supporter of the arts and numerous social service organizations. She was also a competitive golfer and active tennis enthusiast, avid reader, linguist, world traveler and art collector. She leaves two sons, Laurence C.

In evidence, too, is the fact that this adaptation of Leoncavallo's \\"I Pagliacci\\" has escaped, for the most part, from the rigid confines of the stage. And, in transporting their cast and cameras from the footlights to the actual Calabrian setting of the noted work, the producers have given movement, if not especially great acting talents, to the composer's famed musical vehicle.Mario Costa's careful direction has kept the broad histrionics familiar to opera-goers down to a minimum and, while it is not this corner's chore to evaluate the score or the techniques used in projecting it, the fervent and professional singing of the principals seemed to have captured the tragedy as set down by Leoncavallo.As the middle-aged and tormented Canio, Afro Poli gives genuine poignancy to the role and to such tenor arias as the popular \\"Vesti La Giubba.\\" Tito Gobbi, known for previous filmed operatic portrayals, is excellent in handling a major share of the billing and baritone passages as Tonio, the deformed jester, and as Silvio, Nedda's handsome lover. Though it is a moot point whether she actually sings Nedda's arias, Gina Lollobrigida, who is handsomely endowed by nature, is beautiful and spirited as the faithless Nedda.A foreword, written by Sinclair Lewis and narrated by an unbilled commentator, relates how Leoncavallo came to turn from his opera, \\"Il Medici,\\" to \\"I Pagliacci.\\" Though this re-enactment tends to slow matters up, it does give a semblance of authenticity to the story that follows. And non-Italian-speaking viewers should find that story and its lyrics more lucid because of the film's liberal and literal English subtitles.

The furnishings are clunky lamps, overstuffed chairs, tables, console radios and cabinets of the most comforting sort, the ubiquitous garage-sale totems of every American neighborhood, but Mr. Rigdon has subverted their familiarity by painting them a disconcerting coal-black. And rising above the stage, towering clear to heaven, is a wall of equally homey front doors and back doors and screens and shutters, all just as black, all just as ambivalent in effect. Is the American family a warm place to come home to, Mr. Rigdon's monumental collage seems to ask, or is it a dark tomb that must at all costs be escaped?

Our standing in the world -- and our security -- depend upon increasing the number of decent-paying domestic jobs, providing better schooling for our children, rebuilding our roads and bridges, curbing the violence in our cities and converting military industries to civilian use. It is time to reconfigure key Washington institutions to deal with these challenges with the same determination and resourcefulness that we used to confront the Soviet Union. A good starting point is the White House National Security Council.\\n\\nThroughout the cold war, the National Security Council coordinated our opposition to the Soviet military threat. The council is chaired by the President and has as its two other statutory members the Secretaries of State and Defense. Its membership should now be expanded to include others in the Cabinet, including the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Education. Other top officials like the chairman of the Federal Reserve could be invited regularly as advisers. Most important, the historically narrow mandate of the security council -- military security -- should be broadened to include our most pressing economic and social priorities.

Odd and none too rewarding. One is \\"Magdana's Donkey,\\" the other \\"Flames on the Volga.\\" (Both are Artkino presentations.)In the first, some poor Georgian urchins find a donkey and bring it home to their widowed mother. The mother and the original owner go to court over the family pet, she loses and the villagers comfort her. That's it, and how this prolonged fifty-minute fragment ever won a prize at the 1956 Cannes Festival, as is reported, beats us.Unquestionably, there is stark simplicity in the tale itself (written by Tenghiz Abuladze) and in the direction (Mr. Abuladze and Revaz Chkheidze). Most of the time the camera simply hammers across the wretched poverty of the mother, nicely played by D. Tserodze, as she clumps around peddling sour cream. Miss Tserodze has a beautifully mobile face, but fifty minutes is too long to worry over a donkey that, incidentally, looks bored to death the whole time.The misery extends right into \\"Flames on the Volga,\\" a drama about a workers' revolt in a Czarist fish-hatchery, run more like a slave labor camp. As a study of oppressed humanity, this Mosfilm Studio production is at its best toward the middle third, when the various, varying inmates (exactly what they are) come into clear, separate focus. One of their leaders, for instance, turns out to be a singer","excerpt":"add two runaway sweethearts, a sad, strong widow and her very brave little son.Somehow, unfortunately, these people seem less interesting as a grimly united front, in the finale, when the police cart away the rebel leaders as the other peasants triumphantly shout encouragement. And here, it might also be noted, an ominous score by Dimitri Kabalevsky thunders just as optimistically. Why not, indeed?However, in a curious contrast to this positive homestretch is the confused, rather messy opening portion, when the workers mill around and board a fishery-bound Volga steamer. And even during the river trip, including one far-fetched melodramatic episode, it's hard to tell just who is who. This is really puzzling, considering the generally assured tone of Grigory Roshal's direction and L. Trauberg's scenario later on.The acting, on the side of the oppressed, is fine, especially the performances of R. Nifontova, V. Platov, E. Adamaitis and young M. Merkulov. The oppressors, with one execption, are depicted as near-cartoons, and just don't stand a chance. For our money, the most forceful acting is that of Mr. Adamaitis as the hated fishery supervisor — a bully with a conscience.The color photography and the atmospheric settings are consistently attractive. And so, we repeat, is that middle-section unmasking of some bitter, brave individuals.

An even number of cylinders allows the up-and-down motion of each piston to be offset by another piston. An engine with an odd number of cylinders tends to vibrate more. Nevertheless, a few companies have used engines with three or five cylinders. Honda's new four-door Vigor comes with a five-cylinder engine (right) so as to pack more horsepower in a small engine compartment. Honda engineers dampened the vibration by careful timing of each piston's stroke. Their design also incorporates hydraulic devices at points where the engine is attached to the car's frame. The all-aluminum engine displaces 2.5 liters and produces 176 horsepower. By contrast, the Honda Accord has a 2.2 liter four-cylinder engine that produces 125 horsepower.

But a look inside shows that most of them offer little more than a set of poorly proportioned rooms with layouts as predictable as that of a 1930's building.  The apartment shown here, in an East Side high-rise barely 10 years old, was no exception. Though there is the luxury of space - about 2,500 square feet - the rooms were surprisingly conventional. Too conventional, in fact, for the owners, Barbara and Jon Landau. ''We didn't want our lives compartmentalized into a series of preordained cubbyholes,'' said Barbara Landau, who is a freelance editor. ''Who says books have to be relegated to a library or glass to a cupboard?''   Books the Landaus have plenty of. They also have records spanning 30 yards of shelf space, a growing collection of Art Nouveau glass, and several modern paintings and sculptures. Though the couple spends most Saturday afternoons perusing art galleries and auction houses, where they have acquired works by such artists as Milton Avery, Jim Dine, and David Hockney, they did not want their apartment to resemble a series of formal galleries.

Does the musician show respect for small works with small performances? Or is there perhaps an obligation to raise music conceived on a limited scale to a higher and broader plane?   The questions came up several times at Avery Fisher Hall on Sunday evening when Gidon Kremer and Oleg Maisenberg played music for the violin and piano by Schubert, Bartok, Schulhoff, Dvorak and Liszt.

Alas, celestial goings-on are rarely quite as neat as the explanations devised by humans, and the solar system now seems rather creaky compared with the atomic clocks used by the world's official timekeepers.     Compensating for tiny imperfections in the earth's spin and in the definition of a second in atomic terms, the world's time czars decreed the addition of a leap second on New Year's Eve, slightly lengthening 1998.     Leap seconds became necessary in 1972 after scientists redefined the standard second as the time it takes for a cesium atom to vibrate 9,192,631,770 times. Unfortunately, some finagling is needed to synchronize the atomic second with the less accurate and slightly mismatched rotation of the Earth. Were it not for leap seconds inserted now and then, the sun would rise at noon 10,000 years from now.    Because the Earth's rate of spin changes unpredictably, it is impossible to forecast when the next leap second will be needed. That decision will be made by the International Earth Rotation Service, a part of the Paris Observatory that  blows the whistle whenever the difference between solar time and atomic time rises to nine-tenths of a second.     Last week's was the 22d leap second needed to keep timekeeping reasonably correct. (The last one was added on June 30, 1997.)

Shugrue Jr., the trustee of Eastern Airlines, contending that Eastern's program of offering first-class seats to flyers who pay full coach fare has resulted in strong bookings and better cash flow, is asking the bankruptcy court to let the airline withdraw an additional $30 million from escrow funds to keep operating.   The motion was filed yesterday with Burton R. Lifland, the chief judge of the United States Bankruptcy Court. In it, Mr. Shugrue argued that stronger bookings, along with stabilizing fuel prices, could enable Eastern to start generating enough cash from operations by February to avoid having to dip into the escrow funds.   \\"The dramatic results of the initial weeks of Eastern's first-class marketing program, coupled with a decline in the company's cost of fuel and the success of the liquidity program, signal a watershed in Eastern's chapter 11 case,\\" the motion said.   Eastern's unsecured creditors who heard Mr. Shugrue present the same arguments on Wednesday, however, are skeptical and could oppose further withdrawal from the funds, people familiar with their meeting said.   Judge Lifland set a hearing for Nov. 14 at 3 P.M. The unsecured creditors and the preferred stockholders committee, if they wish, can show cause then why the judge should not authorize the withdrawal of the cash.   Since Mr. Shugure was appointed trustee on April 19, taking control of the airline from Frank Lorenzo, the former chairman of the Texas Air Corporation, the unsecured creditors have generally been supportive of his attempts to revive the carrier.   The court authorized the use of $80 million at the time of his appointment, and in three following orders Eastern management was able to withdraw an additional $150 million.   Mr. Shugrue ran an advertising blitz to win back the business flyer in the summer and to promote the first-class program in the fall. Still, the airline has continued to have deep losses.   The unsecured creditors thus must decide whether to support Mr. Shugrue and approve more withdrawals from escrow fund, or to say no because there would be less left for them if the airline is liquidated.   If the unsecured creditors withdraw their support, then the pressure would grow to shut down the carrier and liquidate it. Two Primary Conditions    In the motion Mr. Shugrue said that there was still $257 million in cash left, which would be enough for him to shut down the carrier. But he said that would not occur.   Mr. Shugrue said that Eastern would need an additional $40 million between mid- and late December. Of that, $24 million would be to pay for aircraft leasing and $10 million would be for cash needs in January.   Mr. Shugrue's optimism, however, is dependent on two major factors -- that Eastern can continue to lure business flyers from Delta and other major carriers and that fuel prices do not begin to rise again.    Since Eastern moved its hub to Atlanta, Delta has become its major competitor. For a time Delta allowed Eastern to undercut its fares, preferring to keep a weaker carrier as a competitor rather than to push Eastern into liqudation and thus enable another major airline to come into Atlanta.    Recently however, Delta has matched Eastern's lower fares with lower coach fares. Selling More Assets    Mr. Shugure argued in the motion that during the first three weeks of the first-class marketing program the number of passenger who paid full coach increased by 4.3 for each flight.   He said that the program generated a lot of cash","excerpt":"adding one passenger paying full coach per flight brings in $4 million more in revenue a month.    He also said that Eastern's fuel costs appeared to have peaked on Oct. 16 when it was paying $1.24 a gallon. By Nov. 2, fuel had dropped 12 cents, to $1.12, he said, adding that every 10-cent drop represents a saving of $5 million a month.   The motion also disclosed that Eastern is in the process of selling more assets. The airline has negotiated an agreement to sell a hangar at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport for $7.5 million, and US Air has offered to buy certain Canadian routes.   The motion also said that Eastern was negotiating with Aeroflot to sell or lease a number of its Lockheed L1011 aircraft to the Soviet airline.

The problem is that the millions of dollars investors pour into them generate only razor-thin profit margins for the fund companies.   Scrambling for ways to fatten up margins, some funds have hit on a solution: They are jazzing up their Standard & Poor's index funds with so many bells and whistles that it's starting to sound like nursery school on a rainy day. What might get lost in the din is that bells and whistles cost money. And investors are the ones who pay.   Investors love index funds because three-quarters of mutual fund money managers routinely underperform the market. Thus, one might as well just stick with the index and avoid paying the manager. These are powerful allures, and mutual fund companies just hope their jazzed-up versions will strike a chord, despite higher cost. Here's a look at some of these new funds, their bells and whistles - and the fees charged for them.   The Dean Witter Value-Added Market Series Equity Portfolio tracks all the stocks in the S.&P. 500. But instead of dollar-weighting the portfolio to give stocks of bigger companies a bigger share, the fund divides its portfolio evenly among the index's 500 stocks. That skews the fund toward the smaller companies and explains its recent poor return: For the year ended June 30, 1990, the fund returned 6.3 percent while the S.&P. 500 rose 16.5 percent, according to Morningstar Inc., a Chicago-based mutual fund consulting group.   For its services, Dean Witter charges investors an ongoing 12b-1 fee of just under 1 percent, a one-half of 1 percent yearly management fee and an \\"exit fee\\" that starts at 5 percent and declines each year, disappearing if you hold the fund more than five years.   Because of the steep price, \\"No one could build a case for buying this fund instead of Vanguard's,\\" said Don Phillips, vice president of Morningstar. Indeed, the Vanguard Group, with its Index Trust-500, has cornered the market for a low-cost S.&P. index fund. The 14-year-old fund, with $2.4 billion in assets, is the oldest of the S.&P. index funds, and its performance has closely matched the S.&P. It has no sales charge and its total expenses equal two-tenths of 1 percent.   In March, the IDS Blue Chip Advantage Fund, another S.&P. knockoff, came to market - this one aiming to beat, not match, the averages. Here's the twist: IDS analysts rate the stocks in the S.&P. 500 index on the basis of earnings history, return potential and industry outlook. The fund manager buys the highest-rated stocks in each industry for the fund, which will hold 125 to 250 stocks at one time. Skewing the index is supposed to siphon off stocks that analysts expect to underperform the broad market.   Will it work? IDS claims that it tested its formula using market data back to 1985 and said its fund would have outperformed the S.&P. 500 by an average of 2 percentage points in each of those five years. But future performance is what counts, and experts are doubtful. \\"The stocks in the S.&P. 500 are followed so closely already that it's unlikely the IDS analysts will be able to uncover any market inefficiencies,\\" Mr. Phillips said.   The IDS version is a hybrid between an index and a managed fund. At least the fund managers do something, but some might wonder if their services justify the funds' fees. Investors pay a 5 percent upfront sales load, a management fee of more than six-tenths of 1 percent and an annual 12b-1 charge of just under one-tenth of 1 percent.   Three other fund companies soup up their index funds with option writing, giving investors a low-risk way to play to the movements of the S.&P. 500. The Gateway Index Plus Fund, sponsored by Gateway Investment Advisers, in Cincinnati, Ohio, is typical.   Its portfolio duplicates the S.&P. 100, the largest 100 stocks in the S.&P. 500. Those stocks account for 70 percent of the S.&P. 500's market weight and most of its performance. The fund then writes options on the index rather than on the individual stocks in its portfolio, and when it writes a call option, it receives a premium from the buyer that lifts the fund's return. Because of the premium income, this type of fund tends to do well in flat or declining markets. But it lags rapidly rising markets because the option caps the profit potential.   The Gateway fund has no upfront sales charge. But its expense ratio is 1.4 percent, a full percentage point higher than the average S.&P. 500 index fund.   The Rushmore Stock Market Index Plus Portfolio, based in Bethesda, Md., is a cheaper version, with a 1 percent expense ratio. The Principal Preservation S.&P. 100 Plus Portfolio, based in West Bend, Wis., has a 1.35 percent expense ratio.   Do the option-writing strategies work? Mr. Phillips says that he is skeptical about the concept, because none of the funds has shown consistently that writing options adds value to an S.&P. 500 index fund. But the option-writing feature does guarantee one thing: You will pay a lot more than you would for a plain-vanilla S.&P. 500 index fund.

Every parent has heard that annoying question more than a few times. It may be asked less often as more vehicles come with entertainment systems that keep children occupied on trips.    The systems, which typically include a videocassette player and a small television screen, are especially popular on minivans. Last month, DaimlerChrysler became the latest company to offer a system, which will be available on all Chrysler, Dodge and Plymouth minivans.    Made by the Visteon parts division of Ford, distributed through Chrysler's Mopar unit and installed at dealerships, the system has a 6.4-inch liquid-crystal display screen -- the largest currently offered in a factory-authorized system -- that folds from the ceiling just behind the front seats. A video player is housed inside a slim floor console that can be mounted between the front seats or between a second row of captain's chairs. An auxiliary outlet accommodates a video camera, a compact disc player or most video-game players, including Nintendo 64 and Sony PlayStation.    DaimlerChrysler includes a set of wireless headphones","excerpt":"additional headsets are $42 each. Separate audio controls let rear passengers play games, watch videos or listen to CD's while the driver and front passenger use other audio components. The option is $1,350 plus a $150 installation fee.    Since introducing a similar entertainment system on the Oldsmobile Silhouette Premiere, General Motors has expanded the option to other minivans. Olds's video player is housed in a floor console between the front seats. On the ceiling are rear audio controls and four headphone jacks; there is also a remote control. Rear passengers can independently choose music from compact discs, cassettes or the radio.    The G.M. systems also have plugs for camcorders or video games including Nintendo, Sega Genesis and Sony PlayStation. As with DaimlerChrysler's unit, the front and rear passengers can choose different sources of entertainment.    Pontiac offers what it calls MontanaVision in its long-wheelbase Montana, and  Chevrolet includes a system in the Warner Bros. Edition of its long-wheelbase Venture -- a cross-promotion with the movie studio. Chevy and Pontiac have six headphone jacks, each with its own volume controls.    The G.M. systems, which are priced at about $2,500, are installed at the factory.    Ford offers a Visteon entertainment system in its Windstar and Mercury Villager minivans. (The Villager's twin, the Nissan Quest, also offers one, but vans from Honda, Mazda and Toyota do not.) Instead of folding down from the ceiling, the screen flips up from the back of the console unit that houses the video player. Ford offers features, like headphones and video-game capability, similar to other systems'.    In addition to factory- and dealer-installed entertainment units, a number of companies offer add-on, after-market systems. Some can be taken out of a vehicle and used elsewhere.    Auto industry experts predict that entertainment and what they call ''infotainment'' -- including Internet access -- will be a booming business in vehicles of the future. Concept cars at auto shows and systems shown by after-market companies suggest that video screens may become commonly installed in the back of headrests, like those in some jetliners.
