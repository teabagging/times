Mr. Zara is probably the nation's foremost collector of ''prison money'' - tokens, coupons and other such devices which are used as forms of exchange in jails and prisons. To most people who see Mr.  Zara's material, or hear one of his talks on the subject, it comes as a surprise that prisons have their own special currency. In point of fact, the use of token ''coinage'' was common in U.S. prisons at one time.   Under such a system, Mr. Zara explains, any money found in an inmate's possession at the start of his term, or received by him while in prison, would be credited to his account. Then, from that account, he would be allowed to draw funds, in limited amounts, in the form of prison tokens for use in the canteen or commissary.

The issue is television journalism","excerpt":"specifically, what is it? On one side of the issue are traditionalists, and on the other side are the new people, who may be identified not so much by their age as by their devotion to video. Loosely speaking, the traditionalists embrace a discipline, while the new people look to a technique. How well can they blend images, words and music? Traditionalists say that's not enough, and that in journalism the story must come first. This may seem like an academic argument; it is not. It centers on what television thinks about news. Does it think it's important? The argument broke out when CBS News presented ''West 57th,'' its new magazine show, two weeks ago. If it had been presented by CBS Entertainment, there would have been no argument. ''West 57th,'' however, was a triumph for the new people. Video won; journalism lost, and traditionalists wrung their hands. Fred Friendly, a former president of CBS News, said in a newspaper interview that ''West 57th'' was a ''piece of glitz,'' while William Leonard, another former president, said that it wasn't journalism ''by any stretch of the imagination.'' CBS News, in turn, defended its new program. It was ''solid journalism,'' ''good journalism,'' ''the product of a brand new generation of TV journalists.''

Is it coincidence that Mr. Specter, the only Jewish Republican Senator, is one of the very few G.O.P. leaders who have dared criticize the Christian right? Hardly. If you are an American Jew, you have every reason to worry about a political movement whose most powerful leader, Pat Robertson of the Christian Coalition, calls the constitutional separation of church and state \\"a lie of the left\\" and vows to dismantle it.
