Then you would have the President botch his answer at a press conference, giving as his reason a desire not to ''impose'' a sense of guilt on Germans for the murder of six million.   To top it off, to reach far beyond surviving Jews into the homes of tens of millions of American and German veterans, you would get the President to announce his incredible intention of laying a wreath at a cemetery that includes the graves of Nazi Waffen SS officers who may have been among those responsible for the murder of U.S. prisoners during the Battle of the Bulge. ESSAY","excerpt":"WAR AND REMEMBRANCE"},{"year":"1945","title":"The vast and horrible panorama of war has been copiously \\"covered\\" by the Russians and, with \\"Once There Was a Girl,\\" which arrived at the Stanley on Saturday, another pictorial chapter in the Soviets' casebook against fascism has been recorded. This time the camera has been focused on the plight of children during the conflict in besieged Leningrad, and the story, simplicity itself, has been greatly enhanced by Nina Ivanova, a 9-year-old trouper, who is the film's star.With a minimum of the propaganda line evident, the drama concerns itself mainly with a few months in the life of Nastenka and her 5-year-old playmate, Katia. The former moppet, who bears an odd resemblance to Margaret O'Brien, gives a warm and often touching portrayal of a waif who runs the gamut of tribulations from pitiful loneliness to the death of her mother. Especially poignant is a dream sequence about a happy and scintillating Christmas party and equally moving is her tortured trek across the frozen Neva River, with water for her ailing mother. And the performance of Natasha Zashipina, as her chum, is lispingly natural and uninhibited.Essentially a series of vignette of daily, commonplace occurrences, this picture, while obviously fashioned to tug at the heartstrings more than most Soviet importations, is, nevertheless, both a tender and incisive commentary on a frightful aspect of recent history. As an associate attraction, the management is offering \\"Christmas Slippers,\\" a thirty-minute abbreviation of \\"Cherevicki,\\" an opera by Tchaikovsky based on a story by Nikolai Gogol. Soviet operatic luminaries and the orchestra and chorus of the Moscow Bolshoy Theatre are featured. Both films are equipped with English dialogue titles.

This means that defendants should not be tried in absentia.   Criminal trials held without the presence of the accused would deprive alleged war criminals of the right to confront and cross-examine their accusers. Some argue that defendants waive these rights when they fail to appear for trial.

So far as my understanding of the Dayton agreement goes, there is nothing preventing the implementing powers from forcibly arresting Mr. Karadzic and Mr.  Mladic so they can answer the charges against them at The Hague.

Her film debut, however, in Hunt Stromberg's \\"Young Widow,\\" which came to the Globe on Saturday, does little to negate this fanfare or reveal Miss Russell's abilities as an actress. For this topical drama about a soldier's widow who finally finds happiness with another soldier is neither stimulating drama nor provocative play acting.Since the problems of distaff readjustment are as real as those of returned veterans, this story should have had all the elements of solid entertainment. But \\"Young Widow\\" is merely a slow dissertation in which the drama is heavy and uninspired and the humor scant and routine.Miss Russell's Virgina farm home, complete with \\"hound dog,\\" pickaninnies and devoted relatives, is no sanctuary. And her return to her old job as reporter on a New York newspaper does little to dispel the poignant memories of her husband until she meets a brash young aviator. After much pursuit, this gay blade's surface ardor changes to love. And despite the attentions of her handsome managing editor, Miss Russell learns to love again and look to the future with her dashing aviator hero.Louis Hayward has had better assignments than this. Neither the dialogue nor the situations help make his performance as the flyer more than passing fair. Penny Singleton is completely believable as Miss Russell's roommate, who is awaiting the return of her sailor husband. She gives that role and the bulk of the humorous lines tenderness and sparkle. Miss Russell's appearance in bathing suit and negligé are as impressive as her advance notices. She is strikingly beautiful and it would be pleasant to say that her emoting is on the same plane. But Miss Russell's expressions and her written lines add little to this neophyte's trite and flat role.

But it cannot be assumed, at this point at least, that \\"Singing Guns,\\" the creaking vehicle in which he makes his screen debut, will add anything to that popularity. For the Western, tinted in Trucolor, which arrived at the Globe on Saturday, is an overlong, sometimes silly and rather staid adventure that is not particularly enhanced by the presence of that noted troubadour. Without the help of Ward Bond and Walter Brennan, a couple of expert Hollywood hands who do not sing, Mr. Monroe would have been left with little else than a trio of ballads and some time-worn situations.In \\"Singing Guns\\"—a title, incidentally, which should drive purists mad—our minnesinger plays a Robin Hood-like outlaw who has stolen a neat $1,000,000 in gold dust from the Great Western Mining Company. This outfit, he reveals, has jumped his claim. Then Walter Brennan, Goldville's doctor and preacher","excerpt":"Ward Bond, the sheriff, and Ella Raines, the town's top gambler and saloon keeper, take a hand in reforming the renegade, who substitutes for the sheriff. Needless to say, our boy doesn't see the light until the necessary rounds of ammunition are spent and the villain, in the shape of Jeff Corey, is dispatched.Ward Bond is competently tough as the sheriff, who loses both his girl and the reward to the outlaw who first wounds and then aids his pursuer. Walter Brennan is equally competent as the kindly physician-preacher and Ella Raines is properly handsome as the glittering gambling queen who loses her heart to the newcomer, Mr. Monroe's acting as John Gwyn, otherwise known as Rhiannon, is hardly memorable. Memorable, however, is the fact that he sings \\"Mule Train\\" in this epic, a number that he helped make a spectacular success. He also raises his baritone voice in \\"Mexicali Trail\\" and \\"Singing My Way Back Home.\\" This last tune has a lyric that goes, \\"I'll soon be back where I belong.\\" With a few more films like \\"Singing Guns,\\" that lyric could be prophetic.
