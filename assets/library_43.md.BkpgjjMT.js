It seems certain that all of these actors and relationships will undergo some kind of a change before the last act is played.   In a way, the roots of the hijacking are found in the relationships within the Lebanese Shiite community. It appears that the original group of hijackers was either from an extreme faction within the main, normally moderate, Shiite militia - Amal - led by Justice Minister Nabih Berri, or from one of its more extreme rivals in Lebanon such as ''The Party of God.'' The extremism was underlined by the hijackers' murder of an American Navy diver, Robert Dean Stethem, last weekend. The motives for the hijacking were probably twofold","excerpt":"to embarrass Mr. Berri, whom they view as too moderate and too willing to cooperate, at least tacitly, with Israel; and to refurbish the image of the Shiites within the wider Arab world by undertaking to recover the 766 Lebanese and Palestinians from South Lebanon - most of them Shiites - who have been detained in Israel.

President Bush's offer to deploy American troops to support the relief effort represents the sort of humane leadership the international community requires for effective action.   The bad news is that our troops risk undertaking a dangerous mission without a clear objective. An open-ended notion of why they're there could land them in the very quagmire everyone wants to avoid.   We need to be explicit with ourselves, our allies and Somali friends that our sole objective is to safeguard the humanitarian relief operation -- not to occupy, pacify or take charge of the country politically. Drawing the distinction is vitally important:   * Troops should be used to take control of ports, airfields and storage facilities used for relief purposes","excerpt":"to escort food convoys and personnel; to protect distribution sites; to provide a communications network and air-mobile rescue capability, and to organize and train local civilian guard forces. And they should be ordered to do so in the face of opposition from warlords or hoodlums, using whatever force is necessary.   * But American troops should    not    be used to settle clan feuds, chase down and punish errant warlords, or police any sort of political truce or cease-fire. The time may well come when outside forces are needed for these purposes as well, but that's another mission altogether, involving a different set of policy judgments.   Inevitably, the sheer presence of an imposing modern military force will lend political stability to the situation. But that's incidental. For now, let's focus squarely on the limited but vastly more important objective of saving innocent lives from needless starvation.

A top female marathon swimmer at the time, Friedman had once held the women's record for swimming around Manhattan. On the day that Friedman was to leave for England, however, her husband, Paul Carter, who was to accompany her, was hit by a truck while crossing a Manhattan street on his way to work. Carter died the following day. What follows are excerpts from Friedman's notes about the lure of long-distance swimming and the special bond that exists between people who share that commitment.\\nThe Elements\\nAgony of the Cold: Schroon Lake, N.Y. \\n\\n When we arrived for a training swim that morning in early June 1990, Schroon Lake was as still as death, shrouded in the slightest promise of fog. The water had the opacity of disaster, of depths not meant to be tested. I took off my shoes, hitched my sweat pants above my ankles and walked reluctantly down the boat launch, gasping as the water pierced my feet. It was as if it was solid and sharp, like the ice it had been but a few short weeks before. I stared into the mist, glanced down the ramp toward the deeper water, turned around and walked away from it. \\n\\n\\"Forget about it,\\" I told Paul. \\"Put the canoe back in the truck. I can't even get in that stuff above my ankles.\\"\\n\\nThe water thermometer read 58 degrees, 40 degrees below my body temperature, 26 degrees above freezing.\\n\\nPaul ignored me. I knew he was thinking that if I couldn't do this, I couldn't do the Channel, and for as long as I could remember, I had wanted to swim the English Channel. He continued to load Thermoses and towels into the canoe, using that reproachful silence to coax me into trying again.\\n\\nI slowly, lingeringly, made my way back down the boat launch. Somehow, this time, it didn't hurt as much. It was a lesson that I learned again and again: One can get used to the cold gradually, slowly enough to deaden the pain. I found my cap and goggles and put them on, knowing that it would be a lifetime before I felt warm again. \\n\\nPaul sat floating in the canoe, tantalizingly out of reach. He encouraged me, cheering every inch until I was up to my neck with nowhere to go but towards him, and so I pushed off and started to swim. The shock was too great. An iron band instantaneously clamped itself around my forehead. I turned around, gasping for air as yet another band tightened itself around my chest. Ten strokes and I was back on dry land without making a dent in the nine miles ahead of me.\\n\\nClinging to the memory that water feels marginally warmer on the second try, I steeled myself for another attempt. I knew that the sooner I started and the faster I swam, the sooner it would be over.\\n\\nSo I slipped back into that liquid ice and started swimming for real. Paul was instantly at my side. I tried to convince myself that I was an island of heat, pulling my way through a chill that couldn't touch me. Numbness is generally defined as absence of feeling, but the process by which one achieves it is invariably painful. And once one arrives, it is clear that numbness is nothing more than agony in a different form. \\n\\nWe had agreed that Paul would stop me every hour for food -- for this swim, mostly hot chocolate and chicken soup. When it seemed that an hour would never pass, I asked Paul to stop me every half hour. Even so, it was an eternity until that half hour mark. When I finally stopped, my hands shook uncontrollably as I gulped the hot liquid, feeling the warmth travel through my body as if tracing an anatomical road map.\\nThe Motivation\\nMission or Whim? Paradox Lake, N.Y. \\n\\n While swimming usually brings out all that is graceful in me, that day I fought to free my arms from the water lest they be frozen in place. Each stroke shattered the brittle surface, every breath became a gasp. I just thought, \\"O.K., I'll make it to the next half hour and then I'll get out.\\" But then the hot chocolate would fool me with the illusion of warmth and I'd think, \\"O.K., maybe I'll just go a little further,\\" but then I couldn't stop until the next half hour was up, and the vicious cycle repeated itself until 4 hours and 18 minutes later, I walked out of the water, up the town beach, and into the warmth of Paul's arms.\\n\\nI would imagine that there are a fair number of people who wonder, \\"Why would any sane person put herself through such an ordeal?\\" Maybe the crux of the matter is sanity, but I prefer to think not. There is a certain pleasure in thinking, \\"I have accomplished this. I have swum around Manhattan. I have done something beyond the realm of normal life, out of the ordinary, unexpected.\\" It becomes a secret source of confidence, a private wellspring of originality. \\n\\nMostly, I think I just wanted to swim the Channel because it appealed to me, and all the explanations put forth, all the talk about goals and ideals, are just rationalizations for what was, in effect, a whim. There are those who will never understand why anyone would want to climb Mount Everest or traverse the North Pole if not for fame and fortune, and then there are the rest of us for whom such endeavors seem admirable and courageous only if done for more singular reasons.\\n\\nI read a story once. It was about a man who went to an artist to commission a painting of a fish. Days went by, then months, then years. Finally the man went back to the artist's studio, demanding the painting. The artist took out his brush, dipped it in paint and in minutes had painted a beautiful fish. The man exclaimed, \\"If it was that easy, why did I have to wait all these years?\\" The artist walked to a door, opened it and out tumbled hundreds of paintings of fish. \\n\\nThat is the essence of training, of rehearsing, of learning -- doing something so many times that in the final instance it seems easy, effortless. Sprinters swim thousands of meters daily in order to swim their fastest 50 meters. I swam hundreds of miles so that a particular 20-mile stretch would be attainable. One must enjoy the process as much as the result, the sense that one is at least heading in the direction of that perfect fish.\\n\\nSomehow one forgets the cold, forgets the fear and finds the exhilaration. Waves have that effect on me, the way I would imagine wind affects sailors or powder affects skiers.\\n\\nBut while waves are one thing, cold water is quite another. That summer I became increasingly frustrated by the fact that the cold still hurt so much. I was tired of numb fingers and toes, tired of shivering until my teeth chattered. But Paul came up with the solution: maybe I would never get used to it, he said, it would never feel comfortable to me, but at least I could do whatever it took to stay in. It was all a mind game. How much pain could I stand? How long could I bear the cold? As long as I thought I could. \\nThe Support Crew\\nA Special Bond: Lake George, N.Y. \\n\\n The English Channel swim was born out of happiness, out of intoxication with life. That spring I had the best job I ever had -- painting scenery for the movie, \\"Green Card.\\" Most movies are more drudgery and nonsense than the public could ever imagine. This one was more art and pleasure than I could ever have imagined. The movie studio was near the pool and I found myself swimming more and more, carried along on the richness of my life, killing time so Paul and I could ride the A train home together. Friends started asking if I was training for something and I started thinking, \\"Why not?\\" \\n\\nAt 34, I didn't think I could much longer spare the time and concentration needed for an endeavor such as the Channel. Before I met Paul, the English Channel seemed inconceivable. It was too distant, too costly, too much of a burden to be borne alone. I thought I would do this thing, swim the Channel, and then start acting like a grown-up.\\n\\nWe had decided that a 10-hour swim should be part of the training and chose July 6 on Lake George since it had the coldest water left in the Adirondacks. There would be little sense of progress in terms of distance, only in terms of time. Each hour would be the limit of my focus. Short-term goals make feats of endurance possible, be they landmarks or minutes. While swimming around Manhattan, I told myself, \\"Just make it to the Hudson River. O.K., now just get to the George Washington Bridge, O.K., now Riverside Church, now the Empire State Building.\\" \\n\\nTo approach a swim as one massive endeavor would be overwhelming so one breaks it down into what one imagines to be manageable components. It's the only way I know to get through the rough spots: O.K., just another hour, just another day.\\n\\nThe bond between a marathon swimmer and a support crew is tight. I swim freestyle, or crawl, stroking about 72 times a minute. I alternate breathe -- that is, I breathe on my left, take three strokes, then breathe on my right, take three strokes, etc. Therefore, I am looking at my boat every six strokes, or a dozen times a minute. All the quick glances add up to a long stare, the way flickering images make an old movie or barely noticed gestures become memory.\\n\\nThere is nothing more discouraging than watching a friend bundled up, huddling in a futile attempt to stay dry, knowing that I alone am responsible for his discomfort and boredom. It reached the point where my closest friends declined offers of all-expenses-paid weekends in the Adirondacks. \\n\\nTraining with Paul allowed me to rid myself of the guilt for the most part. We were too intertwined to allocate responsibility or blame","excerpt":"to even remember whose idea the whole thing was. Training together added romance to the tedium, another layer to the pattern of our life. In earlier years, I had hated the intrusion of a boat; the summer of the English Channel I hated swimming alone.\\n\\nJuly was spent in a tightly scheduled training regimen. I left our apartment every morning at 6 A.M. for a workout in the 50-meter outdoor pool at Roberto Clemente State Park in the Bronx.\\n\\nAfter each workout, I drove out to Jones Beach where I forced myself back into the water. Every so often in a lake, I was possessed of an almost overwhelming fear that some Loch Ness-like monster would rise from the depths. I calmed myself by thinking that such a creature would surely recognize me as a kindred spirit and let me be. This worked well enough in a lake, but the ocean was a whole different kettle of fish. The sea was home to creatures far bigger than I, and even the smaller varieties were capable of inflicting great pain.\\n\\nAnd then there was the water, overwhelming in its strength, oblivious to any obstacles in its path. There is a friend of mine, a good swimmer and a strong young man, who was tossed into the sand by a careless wave and will never walk again, or use his arms. Wanting my relationship with the sea to remain superficial, I was determined, with all due respect, to remain on the surface.\\n\\nOnce I settled into the salt water, I got used to its sting, to the momentary panic I felt when I was confronted by that surging power. The corklike buoyancy one has in salt water added to my impression of insubstantiality, allowing me to escape gravity and experience the grace of weightlessness.\\n\\nAfter a planned two-hour swim, or however long it turned out to be, I ate lunch, rested a bit then swam for at least another hour. Then I showered away the salt, changed clothes, drove home and waited for the sound of Paul's key in the lock, the lovely, substantial click that signaled the end of a day spent in the isolation of amorphous splashing.\\n\\nAnd so the summer drifted by, one day floating into the next, sweeping us along on undercurrents of hope, on the promise of dreams realized. It seemed so simple and childlike -- the belief that one could do anything if one just set one's mind to it.\\n\\nAs an adult I had come to realize that there were complications, that giving one's all wasn't always enough, but that summer I regressed into all those youthful assumptions. Being no longer youthful, I feared that it was too good to be true, too good to last. Or maybe that's just how I remember it, filtered as it is through watered down memories.\\nThe Rehearsal Swim\\nMoonless Miles: Crossing the Sound \\n\\n On July 26, I planned to become the first person to swim from Montauk, at the tip of Long Island, to Watch Hill, R.I. It was a perfect training swim for the Channel. The currents, temperature and distance were comparable for the two bodies of water.\\n\\nIt was a rough ride to the lighthouse beach, leaving Paul seasick from the moment we emerged from the still of Montauk harbor. We were behind schedule from the start. A bureaucracy-crazed park employee prevented my starting from the beach, so I was forced to leave from the boat. Paul greased me up while I hung on for dear life, still managing to smear him with lanolin every time I slammed into him. \\n\\nThe first half hour was enough to make me seriously question my choice of hobbies, if not my sanity. I was struggling to keep my long-digested breakfast down. Swarms of jellyfish engulfed me in a translucent cloud of gelatinous bubbles. My new prescription goggles allowed me to see them clearly. One of them brushed against me, then another, then another. Bracing myself for the pain, I awaited the inevitable sting, but it never materialized. They were harmless. \\n\\nWithin a short time, my nausea died down. I eased myself into a rhythm: arm over arm; mind over matter. Ella Fitzgerald's voice floated around in my mind: \\"I'm wild again, beguiled again, a simpering, whimpering child again, bewitched, bothered and bewildered am I.\\" I splashed through waves, rode over the top of them, slid to the bottom, all the while singing and daydreaming. Repetitive motion frees the mind to wander but the discipline imposed by the act of swimming keeps one in check. My mind may have been on the way to France but my stroke count never varied more than two strokes per minute throughout the entire journey.\\n\\nThe first hour is always the longest. It's as if I have to learn time anew. Once that hour has passed, I understand how long it is, that it is not the eternity it seemed. The difficulty in a swim is not cumulative, does not increase with the amount swum. It ebbs and flows. The chop picks up and settles down. The water is cold, then warm, then something in between. The pain increases somewhere, moves on, then subsides.\\n\\nThe currents weren't doing anything they were supposed to; one hour I swam four miles, another only a half mile. I had smeared grease on my prescription goggles, so I switched back to the normal ones and my world was reduced once more to water, sky and the blur of a boat. Paul kept assuring me he could see land just ahead, but like some half-glimpsed truth it remained out of sight for me. However, the excitement in his voice sent me flying over the water. Unfortunately, the tide was against me and what felt like a sprint was more akin to a dead end.\\n\\nWe were all entranced by the elegance of the sunset, until the darkness that followed delivered a new set of problems. It was next to impossible for the crew to keep me in sight. We had bought the clip-on phosphorescent sticks for the Channel swim, but I hadn't thought to bring them along. It wasn't planned that I would swim into the absolute darkness of a starless, moonless night. \\n\\nWe stopped for a conference just outside the harbor at Watch Hill. The crew told me it was too risky to take the boat beyond the last danger buoy as there were rocks lurking in the bay. I had the option of swimming to shore alone, at which time those rocks were still a problem, but only for me. Walking out of the water is the most satisfying part of a swim but this time it was not to be. I let Paul make the decision and he read my mind. The swim would officially end when I touched the final danger buoy, some 200 yards from shore, 3 minutes short of landfall, 19.5 miles from Montauk. I did a final sprint towards the swaying iron mass ahead of me, touched it, and swam back to the cheering boat. Paul pulled me clumsily onto the rear platform. That hug was surely worth the 8 hours and 56 minutes the swim had taken, more solid than standing on dry land.\\nThe Channel\\nLetting Go of Pain: Dover, England \\n\\n We had decided that I had a better chance of sleeping on the plane if I went to work out as usual. So that last morning, the day I was to fly to England, Aug. 8, 1990, I drowsily tore myself out of bed, out of Paul's arms, at about 5:40 A.M. He walked me to the door and we stood there, prolonging our goodbyes. \\"I'm going to need a lot of phone calls today, honey,\\" I said, \\"I love you so much.\\" \\n\\n\\"And I love you, li'l Sal.\\"\\n\\nAnd that was it, without warning, the end of my life, of my love, of any dream that ever meant anything. I drove off to the pool, swam the workout, and came home to pack. I waited for Paul to phone, but by then it was already too late. The police found me through the phone number on the prescription form for seasickness medication that was in his pocket. \\n\\nShortly after his death, several people suggested that I swim the English Channel some time in the future as a memorial to Paul. \\n\\nThey didn't understand about the cold. I knew that I could never go through the training again without him, but it started to seem that if I could do it the same summer, then Paul would really be along, in a way he never could be again. Somehow I figured no pain I inflicted on myself could be as severe as that I was experiencing, so I had nothing to lose. I told no one of my plans.\\n\\nSometime in late August I phoned the boat pilot in England. He was hesitant but agreed to see what he could do if I showed up. The train ride to Dover was simple. The day I arrived I swam. \\"This is barely cold,\\" I thought initially, amazed. \\"This would have been absolutely possible.\\" \\n\\nI swam for 40 minutes but couldn't stop shivering afterwards. The next day I could only stay in for 20 minutes. The beach was too empty. My attention span was too short. It was only possible to swim for as long as the cold distracted me, then I had to move on to something else; reading a book, walking a few miles, taking a train to Canterbury. Letting go of the Channel turned out to be the easiest thing I did that summer. It was without meaning in the context of what had been, and what would never be.\\nThe Aftermath\\nSwimming Alone: Paradox Lake, N.Y. \\n\\n I've taken to spending my summers in the Adirondacks. The first year I didn't swim so much -- lifting rocks to build a stone wall around Paul's grave was exhausting enough. The second year I swam more, and last year I was almost disciplined about it. I swim in the early morning from the dock where once we planned our future. I've rigged a beach ball to a Velcro strap around my ankle, so that no one can complain I'm difficult to spot, and I swim down the center of the lake. I won't give anyone another chance to yell at me for swimming alone. Those rules don't apply to me.

Tel Aviv is more completely built up with the austere, stark forms of the International Style than any city in Europe or the United States. It is a place in which the revolution Modernism sought was won, where modern architecture as far back as the 1930's was not the radical style, as it was then in the United States, but the established one. And it is one of the dullest urban environments anywhere.    A simple case of cause and effect? An all-modern city equals an all-boring city? It is tempting to say yes, particularly at this time in the history of architecture when we tend so often to be willing to see Modernism as a villain. But the fact is that Tel Aviv's problems are far more complex, and come only in part from the architectural approach that dominates its cityscape. First, Tel Aviv surely suffers as much from comparison to the extraordinary city to its east, Jerusalem, as it does from modern architecture per se","excerpt":"to expect it to look anything other than conventional beside Jerusalem would be like expecting Turin to weave the spell of Venice.

GETTING A LIFE: Stories, by Helen Simpson. (Knopf, $22.) Unsentimental, acutely observed British stories featuring two victim classes: women who sacrifice themselves to their children, and career women who rarely see the kids except on weekends. Does that sound like a no-win situation?    THINKS . . . , by David Lodge. (Viking, $24.95.) The brisk, cheerful action in Lodge's most structurally complex novel so far is an affair between a swaggering, jet-setting academic star and a visiting professor of creative writing who is trying to get over her husband's untimely death.    BIG AS LIFE: Three Tales for Spring, by Maureen Howard. (Viking, $23.95.)

SPUTNIK SWEETHEART, by Haruki Murakami. (Knopf, $23.) Murakami's latest novel to be translated into English concerns a beguiling, bohemian young woman, a male narrator who pines for her, and the woman she secretly, desperately loves; a sexual approach leads to a disappearance that defies rational explanation, but maybe not the other kind.

A poet's account of her rotten younger son, whose anger and wildness deeply rattled his enlightened mother's confidence; he grew up at last, but whether his mother's coping efforts helped is not clear.    KISSING IN MANHATTAN, by David Schickler. (Dial, $21.95.) Eleven linked stories that seem to come from an ancient world of happy endings; die-hard romantic strivers seek redemption from their ordinary problems in the dark whirl of a mythical city, some of them in the Preemption, a gargoyle-encrusted apartment building dominating the Hudson at 82nd.    HOW TO BE GOOD, by Nick Hornby. (Riverhead, $24.95.)

In fact, it will take \\"Pacific Liner\\" a long time to be lived down, not only by RKO-Radio but by the Pacific Ocean.There are several conflicting theories about the case. One legend has it that the S. S. Arcturus actually sailed from Shanghai with Victor McLaglen as chief engineer (a slave-driver but a lovable fellow), with Asiatic cholera in the stoke-hold and with three authors in the credit lines, and ultimately dropped anchor in what appeared to be San Francisco Bay. Some others protest that it wasn't cholera at all that Dr. Chester Morris heroically confined below-decks to the inconvenience of the stokers, and the great delight of the budget supervisor, but probably nothing more serious than progressive infantilism of plot structure, an ailment endemic in Western North America, not Asia.But there are still other authorities—old, superstitious C-dogs who have weathered many such voyages—who insist that the Arcturus never left Shanghai that fatal day, but, for all practical cinematic purposes, went down at her dock with all hands, including the ship's nurse, Wendy Barrie; the unctuous oiler, Barry Fitzgerald, who died (like the playwright in \\"Room Service\\") too soon; Alan Hale and the rest of the capable cast, who obviously must have been shanghaied by their agents. All are good sports about it, however, except Paul Guilfoyle, who decides he can't stand any more and jumps overboard early in the picture, the lucky rascal.

Now, under his own name, Mr. Greenberg stands up for feminism and against the occupational battering suffered by women who dare to play the game by men's rules. While polishing the play, he has also put it in context, having added a related one-act, followed by a brief epilogue. The result is a pungent chamber trilogy of character sketches.   In the play, at Manhattan Theater Club's Stage II, the principal character is careering through a crisis. Defeated by bureaucratic back-stabbing, she has been summarily fired from her job as an investigative journalist. In a series of acerbic scenes, Jenny unveils her stored-up hostility.

Goetz shootings, the death by a police shotgun blast of Eleanor Bumpurs and the death in police custody of the graffiti artist Michael Stewart: each case was subject to investigation and preliminary judgment by a secret grand jury. While these events were generating front-page stories, the secrecy of grand jury proceedings was nurturing an atmosphere in which cynicism about the criminal justice system  and accusations of racial bias flourished. The grand jury system, which badly misserves the public interest, should be reformed.  In theory, the secrecy of grand jury proceedings protects defendants and the integrity of the criminal justice process. In reality, it does neither in most cases, which may explain why 25 states prefer preliminary court hearings to grand jury investigations. The purposes of grand jury secrecy are to encourage testimony and to protect witnesses","excerpt":"to guard against the flight of suspects who may not know they are being investigated; to preserve the reputations of innocent suspects; and to assure that an unbiased petit jury can later be convened if a suspect is indicted. Thus, grand juries are useful in organized- crime cases, where secrecy may induce informers and gang members to testify, and in probes of corruption among public officials.  But what about cases in which a suspect is identified or arrested prior to grand jury proceedings? Here, the reasons for secrecy disappear. In publicized cases in this category, the people's right to know the  facts and evaluate the process of justice clearly outweighs any interest in secrecy. In the Goetz case, for example, the key players faced the bright lights of publicity well before the grand jury proceedings. There was no realistic fear that witnesses would either hesitate to testify or be endangered if they did. Normal subpoena power was adequate to compel testimony. The flight of suspects was not a factor, and the protection of Mr. Goetz's reputation was hardly a concern after the publicity he received - and, in fact, courted - after his arrest. \\n\\n     Yet, the public's interest in the case is burning. What happened in that subway car? Was he attacked? Did he have to shoot? Why were two young men shot in the back? What did Mr. Goetz say in his videotaped statement to the police in New Hampshire?

But in the case of \\"Frontier Marshal\\" at the Roxy, nobody can say that Sol M. Wurtzel has not been faithful to the great tradition. With a grand cast, and an excellent job of directing by Allan Dwan, Mr. Earp's screen biography becomes entirely worthy of its fabulous subject.From Randolph Scott, who walks through the role of Wyatt with his customary sang-froid, to Eddie Foy Jr., in the role of his own famous father, the players fit their parts with such perfection that it is hard to know whether to credit the acting or the casting director. In the case of Binnie Barnes, as a bespangled dance hall drab in love with the romantic, melancholy killer, Doc Holliday (with his taste for sable suitings and his resemblance to Cesar Romero), the praise undoubtedly belongs to both. Uncompromisingly blond, hard and harsh-voiced, Miss Barnes is a miracle of rightness.Equally felicitous, albeit in soberer guise, is Nancy Kelly as the Good Woman who has followed the dark-browed, diseased, idealistic killer to the hell-holes of Tombstone with adoring eyes. Eddie Foy Jr., in one of his Dad's old costumes, is delightful, and John Carradine, with that pulmonary picturesqueness of his, is too mean to live in his role as the major menace, whose outlaw dance hall is plowed under to make way for a savings bank before Earp gets through with the town. In short, \\"Frontier Marshal\\" is a cracking good Western, and in the movies there's nothing much better than that.At the Teatro LatinoAbout the only way in which \\"El Muerto Murio\\" (The Dead Man Died), the current Mexican comedy of errors at the Teatro Latino, differs from a fast-moving, well-acted Hollywood film of the same type is in language and locale. \\"Chato\\" Ortin, the big, snub-nosed funny man who has become about as popular in Harlem as in Mexico itself, has two of the most charming Spanish-language actresses, Adriana Lamar and Gloria Marin, to help him keep the audience entertained all through the superficially complicated but essentially simple action.Good work is also done by Matilde Corell, as a servant, and by Carlos Montezuma in the role of one of the husbands annoyed by the life-like portraits of the late celluloid spouse of Adriana in Mexico City who at the same time had been supporting Gloria in Guadalajara. Naturally, paintings are junked in the finale and the defunct double-dealer is dead in every way. Alejandro Galindo directed the picture for the Iracheta y Elvira concern.

We also know he's on the premises because his parents, whose recollections of Scorsese family lore take up most of the 45-minute running time of \\"Italianamerican,\\" at one point begin worrying about whether one of their famous son's teeth looks funny. But for the most part, Scorsese the Director prefers to keep Scorsese the Son safely off camera, and his parents prefer to behave as if they had just made the acquaintance of a very charming stranger.By deliberately attempting to limit his own influence, Mr. Scorsese backhandedly turns himself into the film's most important figure. His parents are a bit nervous, and they clearly aren't behaving the way they ordinarily might","excerpt":"to heighten the formality with which they present themselves. Mr. Scorsese invites them to tell stories they've told a hundred times before, but their carefully chosen words and expansive smiles speak volumes about the pride they take in their boy's success, and the momentousness they attach to his work. It's delightful to see how flattered they are by their Marty's making them a part of his professional life.\\"Italianamerican\\" concentrates mostly on keeping up appearances, but there are occasional lapses and digressions, all of them welcome. Mr. Scorsese, sending his mother into the kitchen to make spaghetti sauce for the camera, uses a tone that would make a drill sergeant sound like the Easter Bunny by comparison. Later, the film's closing credits include Mrs. Scorsese's recipe.Of the five films on the Film Forum's \\"Scorsese's Italianamerican & Other Family Portraits,\\" Mr. Scorsese's is the only one made in a spirit of affection.\\"Album,\\" an animated short by Linda Heller, concentrates on parental repressiveness, but Miss Heller's animation is so sweetly whimsical that the sting is minimal.Equally successful, and equally fish-eyed, is Lenny Lipton's \\"Happy Birthday Lenny.\\" Footage of an apartment, presumably the director's, is interspersed with shots of lush tropical foliage and birds flying free. All the while, a woman sobs nonstop about her son's not being tidy enough, and about the various sacrifices she has made. The credits don't specify whose voice we're hearing, but if she isn't Mama Lipton, she must be the greatest actress in the world.Jan Oxenberg's \\"Home Movie\\" shows a group of lesbians merrily playing football, and Miss Oxenberg uses childhood films of herself, somewhat unpleasantly, to reinforce ideas about herself that came later in life, rather than to explore the attitudes that were evident years ago.\\"A Visit to Indiana,\\" by Curt McDowell, uses the strangely self-destructive technique of combining rough, almost unwatchable footage of an Indiana family with a sardonic voice-over conversation. The dialogue is funny, but it distracts attention from footage that is already hard to follow, and the prevailing spirit is so sarcastic it turns sour.

She was 93 years old and died of heart failure on April 8th, at home, peacefully in her sleep. She was known for her pioneering leadership in the field of social work, but the passion closest to her heart was her family, especially Kal, her adored late husband. Martha deeply loved her daughters and sons-in-laws, Judith and Howard Rubenstein, and Elaine and David Gould, and her grandchildren Emily Rubenstein, Adam Rubenstein, Jennifer Rubenstein, and John Rubenstein, Dina and Adrian Halme, Talya Gould and Sara Gould, and Jennifer's fiance, Benjamin Zigun. Martha took great pride in all of their accomplishments. Her family in turn was very proud of Martha's professional achievements and unstinting dedication to Jewish communal service. She was a devoted wife, mother, grandmother, friend, mentor and teacher. Contributions in her memory can be made to the Martha K. Selig Institute of the Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services, 120 West 57th Street, Room 921, NY, NY 10019. Named for her by her admirers, the Institute remains among her greatest honors and most significant accomplishments in advancing the education and training of social work professionals. She will be greatly missed, but the world will continue to benefit from her good works.     $(6$)SELIG--Martha K. The Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services mourns the passing of Martha K. Selig. She was a true giant in the social work field whose career spanned six decades. As the first director of community services at the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies, Martha was the catalyst for many of the programs and agencies which today form the extraordinary UJAFederation network. She joined JBFCS in 1974 after her ''retirement'' from Federation and the Scheuer Family Foundation. At JBFCS, she was responsible for helping to develop some of the most innovative program models in social work and mental health. Her greatest passion and most prized accomplishment was the expansion of the agency's professional education division, considered among the best in the country. It was named the Martha K. Selig Educational Institute by her beloved friends Bud and Amy Cohen. Martha further helped advance clinical excellence with the creation of the Center for the Study of Social Work Practice, a partnership with the Columbia University School of Social Work, and the Saul Z. Cohen Chair in Child and Family Mental Health. In 1989, she led the agency in its $25 million capital campaign which allowed for the rebuilding of aging facilities and strengthened programming to meet newly emerging community needs. In partnership with her dear friends, Rita and Stanley Kaplan, Martha inspired the creation of the Kaplan Center for Community Services in mid-Brooklyn, and just last year saw the opening of another of her dreams, The J.W. Beatman Center, a state-ofthe-art services center in Riverdale. Martha was very proud to call herself a social worker. A true one of a kind, she was smart and determined and challenged us at every juncture. We will miss her every day but will continue to follow her instructions to always do better and to never, never, never give up. Our sincere condolences to her daughters, Elaine, a Selig Institute board member, and Judy and their families whom Martha loved and cherished most of all. John A. Herrmann Jr., President Jean L.

To show things as they are was the challenge she set herself","excerpt":"to her that meant a simple and direct portrayal of people firmly rooted in their time and place. Lange moved from New York to California in 1918, having picked up her technical training by doing odd jobs in Manhattan studios. She became friends with a circle that included Imogen Cunningham and Ansel Adams, and for a time ran a successful portrait business. During the early years of the Depression, when breadlines and picket lines formed in San Francisco, she began  to photograph trouble in the streets. Subsequent work in the 1930's focused on rural poverty and migration, which she documented for studies directed by her husband, the economist Paul Taylor, as well as for the Farm Security Administration. THE PHOTOGRAPHS OF DOROTHEA LANGE (Hallmark Cards/Abrams, $35) includes her famous images, like \\"Migrant Mother,\\" as well as those from other,  less well-known series, like those on the internment of Japanese-Americans in 1942, on war workers in a California shipyard and on a California public defender's office. By her choice of perspective, use of gesture and framing, Lange's photographs convey her empathy and passionate belief in human dignity. The book, with text by Keith F. Davis, who has written extensively on American photography, reflects Lange's taste with its spare presentation of 85 reproductions and accompanying quotations or comments, a device Lange often used herself.

She pushed us to greater heights and insisted on the highest standards for our programs. She encouraged us to think and to question and always to achieve the best for our clients and the communities we serve. Doris had an incredible wit and sharp mind.

Perhaps they were not precise to the last detail. \\"Laughter in Paradise\\" tries in a somewhat lackadaisical manner to add a humorous amendment to that tenet.For the British import, which arrived yesterday at the Sixtieth Street Trans-Lux, is trying to illustrate that the sudden acquisition of wealth is not the sole highroad to happiness. But this is a variation on a theme that is not in the tradition of the slickest British humor, nor is it likely to tickle the funnybone continuously. It is, at best, an extended antic that only occasionally is inventive. Despite a truly surprising ending, \\"Laughter in Paradise\\" is merely pleasant, not especially surprising, comedy.Michael Pertwee and Jack Davies, who wrote the story and script, and Mario Zampi, who produced and directed, begin with unusual ingredients in telling the story of Henry Augustus Russell's strange bequests to his four nearest relatives.Mr. Russell, it appears, was England's No. 1 practical joker. In order to earn her £50,000 legacy, his sister, Agnes, was asked to find a job as a domestic. This, it turns out, was a sardonic order since Agnes was a spinster who vented most of her bitterness on her own servant. The same applied to Simon, a wolf and wastrel, who was asked to marry the first woman he talked to","excerpt":"to Herbert, a timorous bank clerk, who was asked to simulate holding up his bank manager, and to Deniston, a retired army officer, correct in manner but secretly the author of many penny thrillers, who was supposed to break the law and be jailed.Thereafter, however, the plot thickens but doesn't improve appreciably. Our four principals find that meeting the provisos of the testament takes a lot of doing. But it is rather obvious going and, except for the dénouement, is not exactly inspired. The surreptitious author's attempts to land in the hoosegow has its moments as the police ignore his efforts to shoplift and his possession of burglar's tools.For this the viewer can be grateful to Alastair Sim, the bald comic, whose mobile but woebegone countenance and meticulous phrasing have been the hallmark of more than one British comedy. Although he loses the prim maiden to whom he has been engaged for a decade, he gains a more decorative and appreciative lass in Eleanor Summerfield. Mr. Sim, it might be noted, portrayed an author of detective novels before in \\"Hue and Cry,\\" but the writers of this film need not be censured for making him repeat.Fay Compton contributes an excellent portrayal as the spinster who comes to love her fellow-man through her trial, and Guy Middleton as the playboy; George Cole as the timid bank clerk; Joyce Grenfell as Sim's forbidding fiancée; A. E. Matthews as her jurist-father, and John Laurie, as the hard-bitten employer of Miss Compton try to make \\"Laughter in Paradise\\" the gay adventure it was meant to be.

Palmer worked as a commercial real estate broker for over 30 years, as a result of his successes as a promotional broker the Uris Buildings Corporation asked the Cross and Brown Company to name he and his partner David Hoffman as rental agents for 300 and 320 Park Ave. Over the years he would serve in that capacity for many buildings, including 3,90, 200, 300, 320 and 410 on Park Ave. alone. Many of the Fortune 500 companies found their headquarters offices through his efforts, the likes of which included National Broadcasting Company (NBC) and International Paper.

Palmer graduated from the Millbrook School in 1954, and Brown University in 1958, where he received his BA in history, beginning what would be a lifetime passion for US history. He toured Civil War battle sites with friends, and explored the genealogy which dated back to Walter Palmer, settler of Stonington, CT, in 1652. Following Brown, Palmer served his country as a first lieutenant in the United States Marine Corps for two years. Palmer also pursued a lifelong passion for tennis, something passed to him from his father Palmer Sealy Sr., a USTA doubles finalist.

In 1975, through a very generous gift, he and his beloved wife, Evelyn, who died a year ago, established a research endowment and helped facilitate the first unified Department of Ophthalmology at Montefiore and the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. A decade later, Sol and Evelyn Henkind were major contributors to the Paul Henkind Memorial Fund after the untimely death of their nephew. In honor of their outstanding generosity, Montefiore dedicated the Sol and Evelyn Henkind Eye Institute in 1992. It is now located in the medical center's Jerome L. and Dawn Greene Medical Arts Pavilion. Mr. Henkind also gave of his time as an active volunteer for the Jewish Braille Institute, where he made 360 recordings of Yiddish tales and translated more than 300 stories and other works from Yiddish to English. Born in Russia, he started his long business career selling dungarees on the Lower East Side and achieved his major success in real estate development. At Montefiore, he was a trusted business advisor to the Opthalmology Department. His extraordinary gifts to us were often surprises and always blessings. Our heartfelt sympathy is extended to his son, Lewis, a committed member of Montefiore's Board of Trustees","excerpt":"to his daughter, Dr. Ellie Henkind Katz, and to their entire family.

MODELL-Michael S. Forty-eight years ago God sent an angel to us who showered our lives with countless blessings and whose passing fills our hearts with unbearable sorrow. Our precious and beautiful son Michael was our inspiration. Our joy was to look at him, to know him, and to love him. Now, all our joy has gone. He gave the world his joy and laughter, his brilliance and integrity, his boundless courage, and his abiding compassion. For 34 years, he suffered the capricious and excruciating pain of Crohn's disease with incredible grace and valor. He poured all his love and concern into his family and dedicated himself to helping others who battled inflammatory bowel disease. Together with his brave and beautiful wife Abby, he raised millions of dollars for medical research and worked tirelessly on behalf of the Crohn's & Colitis Foundation of America. He touched the lives of millions of people whose lives are ravaged by Crohn's and Colitis and gave them hope, encouragement and a shining example of how much one person can do to ease the suffering of others. During the past three years, Michael valiantly fought cancer, the last cruel complication of Crohn's disease. As he lay dying, he gave no thought to himself but only to his family. To each of us, he spoke precious words of love and gratitude. He died as he lived, with beauty, grace, compassion, courage, dignity, and boundless love. For his wife, Abby, his children Alex, Andrew and Ashley, his brother Mitchell, his sister Leslie, his nieces Shawn, Melissa, Brittany, and baby Ashley, for all his family, friends, associates, for everyone who was touched by Michael, and for us, his parents, the only words that can express our grief echo Jacob's cry in Genesis: Our angel is gone and we will mourn him till our deaths.

Howard was a man of commanding intellect and sweeping vision. He was a brilliant lawyer and negotiator, patron and lover of the arts, and a passionate, articulate and persusive spokesman for Israel and the Jewish people, civil rights and civil liberties, and the City he loved so much. He was equally conversant with international, domestic and Jewish affairs, art and literature, law and politics, and the latest sports results. The son of Jewish immigrant parents, he knew and advised Presidents, world leaders, members of Congress, governors, mayors, artists and art organizations, and countless others. Affiliated with the American Jewish Congress for over 40 years in capacities from staff attorney to President, he succeeded in all of those roles with a dazzling mix of ability, charisma, hard work and abiding loyalty. His commitment to AJCongress, and the Jewish community here, in Israel and world wide, was unshakable. It was to him we confidently turned first for principled and practical advice on matters as diverse as Israel, separation of church and state and religious liberty, freedom of speech, inter-group relations, and organizational concerns. He left an insightful and enduring imprint on those and countless other issues. AJCongress, and all with whom he shared his bold vision and considerable talents, are immeasurably the better for having benefited from his counsel. We, and they, are diminished by his passing.

Once the favorite hunting grounds of George Washington and his friend, Lord Fairfax, it is a land of gently rolling countryside, of fabulous estates enclosed by dry stone walls and snake&#8208;rail fences, a near replica of the famed foxhunting area of Leicestershire, England. Writing in his diary in 1751, Washington, then a young surveyor in the valley, spoke of the pleasures of fox hunting: &#8220;Although a heavy man, he [Lord Fairfax] was a fine horseman; and, as I was never tired in the saddle, we were much engaged in the hunting of wild foxes.&#8221; But the Hunt Country is not just a private reserve for wealthy horse fanciers. It is a land, too, of small villages dating back to the early 1700's, of crossroads general stores where Americana can be found tucked away on dusty shelves, of hiking trails and walking tours and fined vistas, of gala race weekends in which even those not interested in the horses can enjoy tailgate picnics aiid fresh country air. And for history fans, there are markers telling of Revolutionary War skirmishes and the exploits of Mosby's Raiders during the Civil War. The Hunt Country has been a favorite weekend retreat for many of the nation's Presidents, including James Monroe, Franklin D. Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson. And although the suburbs of nearby Washington, D.C., are creeping ever closer, it is still one of the few nearly unspoiled areas along the Eastern Seaboard.

That is, he misleads her up to a point, and then she is completely baffled by his behavior.The young lady, it might be said, is many steps behind the audience in this respect, for \\"Perilous Holiday\\" is not exactly a tight mystery. Nor is it very exciting, even when it becomes obvious that Mr. O'Brien is playing a delicate game of cat and mouse with a dangerous group of renegade Americans. But the story comes off smoothly enough and in a genial fashion not often encountered in potboiler melodramas. The principals get able assistance from Alan Hale, Edgar Buchanan, Eduardo Ciannelli and Audrey Long. In a sense, \\"Perilous Holiday\\" is one of the \\"quietest\\" films the Rialto has had in a long while.

By Michael Delahaye. (Macmillan, $15.95.) Confronted by an American President's demand that Israel hand back the West Bank, the Israeli Government produces evidence of a stupendous archeological find - the first-century skeleton of a crucified man in his 30's lying in an ossuary inscribed ''Jesus the Nazirite.'' Soon the Vatican has joined Washington and the Palestine Liberation Organization in a mission to purloin the bones. Michael Delahaye presses the plot to a heart-racing conclusion. But ''On the Third Day'' is something more than a summer read. It is also a political novel of some insight. Career politicians, those ''self-serving apparatchiks,'' are dangerous not simply because they lack integrity, an aging Ben-Gurion-like figure tells Israel's prime minister, but because they lack ''the quality that distinguishes the statesman from the politician: vision - the ability to think in decades, not days","excerpt":"to look beyond the cluttered foreground to the distant horizon, the mountain peaks ahead, not the puddle at your feet.'' In ''On the Third Day,'' in fact, Mr. Delahaye, a former BBC reporter, has written a novel about political vision. It is that vision that determines the outcome of the novel's bone-snatching scheme, and also determines the future of Israel and the Roman Catholic Church. Indeed, it is a tribute to the book that its politics do not interfere with the suspense and that its elements of suspense do not detract from its political insight. The book has flaws - all the Americans are editorial-page cartoons and the love interest is laughable - but even so it is not too much to say that ''On the Third Day'' is everything a novel should be.

The major theoretical criticism of that argument, as noted by Roger Brinner and his associates at Data Resources Inc., an economic-analysis concern, comes from those economists who argue that income taxation is less pro-growth than consumption taxation.

We don't follow these demigods or gorgons for their own sakes but because they give us a far view of a near condition.The mortal defect of Jacques Rivette's \\"Duelle\\" is not its slow pace or mannered style or even its obscurities. It is its failure—deliberate, apparently—to cross over to its audience at any point or to inveigle its audience across to it.\\"Duelle,\\" which is showing today and tomorrow at the New York Film Festival in Alice Tully Hall, is about the struggle between a Sun spirit and a Moon spirit, in the course of which several ordinary people are badly chewed up. It is simply about itself, despite its contemporary references and setting. It spills over into nothing of ours but décor, and even the décor is an airless, garish, 1930's affair.The whole thing is filmed inside a Tiffany lamp. As the characters stand at the far end of significant perspectives, they resemble nothing so much as show-window mannequins draped portentiously in the foreground of some nonexistent intrigue—sheikhs seducers or beached Rolls-Royces in the background.Bulle Ogier and Juliet Berto are, respectively, the Sun and Moon spirits. They duel for possession of a large diamond that will permit the victor to remain on earth for more than the allotted 40 days annual terrestrial leave. Both are fine actresses and it is interesting to see what different effects their inchoate roles have upon them.Miss Berto has mobile features and the wooliness of her part results in our not being quite sure, for a long way into the film, whether she is one or several characters. Miss Ogier, an actress of very pronounced character, is always Bulle Ogier; sometimes dressed up in a Sun-spirit wig.Their rivalry has them interfering in the lives of several people — Lucie, a hotel night clerk; Elsa, a tax dancer, and Pierrot, a man of no defined profession who variously possess or know the whereabouts of the talisman. The rival spirits maneuver these humans back and forth. All three end up damager, two of them mortally.The episodes, and some of the speeches, drift off at times into substantial obscurity; although their general meaning is not hard to grasp. Rivette and his screenwriter, Eduardo de Gregorio, have set out the two spirits with a deliberate, prosaic harshness. There is nothing suggestive or allusive about them.Their virtue, at most and only rarely, is to be funny. There is an amusing scene where they gossip through pastry and champagne in what looks like a corner of the Hotel Ritz, before taking up their duel.There are one or two places where Rivette takes the momentum of the duel's climax and makes something visually affecting out of it: a confrontation, for instance, on a Metro platform between the Moon spirit and Pierrot. But these moments come far too late in a long, elaborate and profoundly unnecessary movie.

But as it stands, something on the order of half a dozen consecutive days of 90-degree temperatures and matching humidity plus a resolution of the Concorde dispute sufficient to touch off a wave of uncritical Francophilia will be necessary to blind audiences to the schizophrenic lopsidedness of this French movie, which opened yesterday at the Baronet.The work of Yves Robert, who directed \\"The Tall Blond Man with One Black Shoe,\\" \\"Pardon Mon Affaire\\" is basically a standard-issue French infidelity comedy — built around Jean Rochefort as Etienne, the bumbling middle-aged civil servant who takes one look at a model named Charlotte (Anny Ruperey) and decides the time has come to cheat on his wife, Marthe (Daniele Delorme).Having no previous experience at infidelity, Etienne manages to make an inadvertent assignation with his receptionist","excerpt":"to make an idiot of himself on horseback after he discovers the model likes to ride; to find himself in Brussels while the model is waiting for him in London; to lure her to what he believes is a vacant apartment only to discover that he has brought her to his own birthday party; and to wind up on television when he takes refuge from the model's husband on a Paris window ledge.It's thin stuff, but it has its amusing moments, including the pursuit of Etienne's wife by a student whose ardor is matched only by his utter humorlessness.What makes \\"Pardon Mon Affaire\\" a lopsided film is its concern with Etienne's friends—Bouly, who cheats regularly on his wife and is devastated when she leaves him; Simon, the doctor who is henpecked by his mother, and Daniel, who turns out to be a homosexual.When they are simply adjuncts to the story of Etienne, they serve a useful purpose. But \\"Pardon Mon Affaire\\" seems to be trying to say something about the lives of these three other men and beyond that, about the friendship of all four. Unfortunately, it either lacks the time or the insight. Whatever the reason, the result is an unbalanced film, torn between the silly and the serious, doing total justice to neither.This film is rated PG (Parental Guidance Suggested\\"). There is nothing terribly erotic about it, but there are some caresses and scenes in bed.

The event - the transport of the rum, that is - has been celebrated ever since in college song, and the image has proved durable","excerpt":"to many, Hanover is still a frozen north woods outpost that closes its gates at nightfall and returns to the casks and flagons.   Well, it isn't like that anymore. Always admired for its crystalline grace, winter Hanover has in recent years become lively, rum or no rum, and only some of it has to do with the old standby, skiing. The floodlit bell tower of Dartmouth's Baker Library has become a campanile for the Upper Connecticut River Valley, a beacon for an array of exhibitions, concerts, plays and movies, as well as lectures and colloquiums, sporting events, restaurants and nightlife to be found in this town of 9,000, excluding students (who currently number 4,300 men and women; Dartmouth became coeducational in 1972). While many of these events flow from the college, they are hardly private. Because of its pastoral setting, and its deep and longstanding involvement in the community, Dartmouth does not draw into an institutional clench at the approach of the public. Almost without exception, what goes on in Hanover is available to anyone. And the exhibits and events are inexpensive (often free).

His lectures have been gathered into a book, ''On Film: An Introduction to the Craft of the Director,'' which is being published this month","excerpt":"to mark the occasion, the MUSEUM OF MODERN ART has been screening all nine of Mackendrick's features, with ''MANDY'' (1952), certainly the rarest and perhaps the most moving of them all, screening on Sunday at 2 p.m.    A disabled child, a subject that usually inspires moist sentimentality or inspirational hogwash, here becomes the center of a tough and realistic portrait of a middle-class family in collapse. The deafness of 12-year-old Mandy (the child is played by MANDY MILLER) drives apart her uncomprehending parents (PHYLLIS CALVERT and TERENCE MORGAN). Enter the brilliant teacher (JACK HAWKINS) who may be able to pull the child out of her isolation, if only he can persuade the government to continue financing his school.    More than a social protest film, ''Mandy'' is a heartbreaking portrait in childhood (and human) isolation, a theme Mackendrick picked up 11 years later, also with unforgettable results, in ''Sammy Going South,'' known in the United States as ''A Boy Ten Feet Tall.'' The story of an abandoned British child who makes his own way across the African wilderness, it plays Monday at 8 p.m. The Mackendrick tribute continues to the end of the month, finishing with a seminar on Sept. 30. 11 West 53rd Street, Midtown, (212)708-9480, www.moma.org.

For the customers, market day is an opportunity to go to town, to stock the larder, meet friends, exchange news, complain about prices and generally catch up on things that have happened since the last market day.   Of the 60-plus English markets I have visited, the smallest and briefest was at Croscombe, a tiny village (pop. 850) about 20 miles from Bath in the west country, where I rented a medieval house last summer. Instead of a vast hall, Croscombe has its market in a small, stuffy church outbuilding that has room for just six folding tables.  There are no Dutch-grown tomatoes, South African plums or Jaffa oranges sold here, for the Croscombe market fare consists entirely of handmade crafts and home-cooked or home-grown foods, and only in bad weather is anything left after 20 minutes.

By \\"Inland Ships\\" Over \\"The Macadam Trail\\"; Miss Winn's Twentieth-Century Odyssey of Travel by Motor Coach"},{"year":"1962","title":"A PERFECTLY lovely little picture that artfully combines appreciation of the natural humor of children and their basic disposition to love and trust has come to us from Britain. It is Beaver Films' \\"Whistle Down the Wind,\\" which appropriately had its local premiere at the Little Carnegie on Saturday.We note that the timing was appropriate because the substance of this thoroughly charming film is evolved from the reverence and devotion of a group of English north-country farm children for their concept of Jesus Christ. And the theme of it is the poignant difference between purity of faith in a child and the lip service paid by many adults to the ideals of Jesus in this modern world—all of which is particularly fitting for consideration in the Easter season.Don't let this lead you, however, to assume it is theological or to look for a Sunday-school aura of piety in this film. While it deals with sensitive material that might seem blasphemous to some—and, indeed, might well be embarrassing if it weren't handled with consummate skill and taste—it is beautifully simple, naturalistic and remote from religiosity as it tells, with great humor and compassion, of children and brotherly love.The story is elementary, so simple and inviting, indeed, that one wonders now why it hadn't been written long before it was recently put into a novel by Mary Hayley Bell. It is the story of three farm children, the oldest of whom is a girl of maybe 13 or 14, who encounter one day in their father's barn an exhausted man whose troubled face is covered with a short, dark beard.Involved at the moment in hiding some kittens they have saved from being drowned, and also flushed with a fantasy of heaven after a brief encounter with a Salvation Army lass, the children are ripe for an illusion. So, when the older girl asks the startled man who he is and he mumbles blankly as he falls in a faint, \\"Jesus Christ!\\", she is awesomely convinced and informs the others that \\" ???'E has cum back to our barn.\\"From here on it is the three children—the older girl, a younger one and a boy of 6 who is absolutely the most terrific little fellow we've ever seen in a film—taking care of the vagrant, sneaking bread (and wine) out to him, keeping it dark from their stolid father and their starchy aunt, but at the same time letting the kids in the neighborhood know the wonderful, awesome secret that they have the returned Jesus in their barn.The details of their reverence and excitement, their respect and solicitude, are wonderfully genuine and humorous, and they are handsomely acted and conveyed in a filmic design of almost documentary sharpness under the fine direction of a new hand at it. Bryan Forbes. There are so many brilliant touches, so many simple and poignant parallels to the Biblical story of Jesus, from His birth to His crucifixion, that a recount of them is impractical. Their discovery is one of the joys to be had from the film.Of course, you anticipate the ending. The vagrant is a criminal fugitive, and his betrayal to the grown-ups by the small boy is a most poignant consequence of the youngster's basic doubts. (The man, whom the lad entrusts with his sick kitten, lets it die.) And the end is so full of tenderness, beauty and meaning that it must be seen.Credit for this exceptional picture goes to many—to Mr. Forbes and to Richard Attenborough, who produced it","excerpt":"to Mary Hayley Bell, who not only wrote the story but is the mother of Hayley Mills, who plays the older girl in what is surely one of the most sturdy and eloquent performances of a sensitive child ever done.But little Alan Barnes, who plays the small, garrulous boy as naturally as a kid throwing stones; Bernard Lee, who plays the father; Alan Bates (seen here recently in the play, \\"The Caretaker\\"), who imparts to the role of the fugitive a most subtle blend of shabbiness and radiance; Malcolm Arnold, whose musical score is a major asset to the picture, and numerous others, children and grownups, all merit praise and affection for giving us one of the most enjoyable and heartwarming films we've ever seen.As a bonus on the Little Carnegie's program, there is a deliciously wacky short—a thing of superb and witty spoofing—called \\"The American Way.\\" It was made by Marvin Starkman and Laszlo Hornblower.

Even more importantly, perhaps, by confirming their hopes, it raised fresh ones. It was a dream come true - not exactly in the way that had been anticipated, but palpably enough to hold out the possibility that many other dreams might come true as well.

The protean Mr. Guinness as eight members of a ducal clan that must be got around by a young kinsman bent upon becoming the duke is so deft in his brief impersonations, so sharp and trenchant in his economical thrusts, that with this one film he should graner three or four awards for fine support.But don't let this obvious admiration for Mr. Guinness obscure the fact that the picture itself is a sparkling and sometimes devilishly cutting jest or that the other performers in it are of excellent quality, too. Indeed, Dennis Price as the young man who cooly undertakes a monstrous scheme of killing off all his kinfolk in order to succeed to the family coronet is as able as Mr. Guinness in his single but most demanding role, and Joan Greenwood and Valerie Hobson are provocative as women in his life.Credit must also be given to Robert Hamer and John Dighton, who wrote the script","excerpt":"to Mr. Hamer,' who capably directed, and to Michael Balcon, who produced. And, since we are flinging bouquets, we might as well toss one, wistfully, to our old friend, Sacha Guitry, whose pre-war films are much resembled by this work.As a matter of fact, there is so much about \\"Kind Hearts and Coronets\\"—so much in subject and in spirit—that is reminiscent of Guitry's \\"The Story of a Cheat\\" that a person of suspicious nature might suspect that it had been thereby inspired. In the first place, the narrative pattern is the same as that of the memorable French film, the story being told—and narrated—as the recollections of a candid scoundrel. And, in the second place, the whole development of the scoundrel's calculated career—in this case, of civilized murder—is described in the finest spirit of Gallic wit.You see, it is all so refined and proper. The instincts and conduct of the young man who aspires to the eminence of a dukedom, from which he seems hopefully removed by the precedence of several relatives and an indiscrete marriage which his mother made, are elegant and impeccable. He does everything in the most considerate way—even to polishing off one of his kinsmen, a windy general, by putting dynamite in his caviar. And his deference to the etiquette of concourse with the ladies is past compare.Most scathing, however, of the incidents (to put it mildly) which this gentleman completes is that of the dignified poisoning of an aged vicar, member of the ducal clan. And it is in this sardonic depiction that Mr. Price and Mr. Guinness achieve the supremacy of their satire. Mr. Price, for this episode disguised as a touring bishop, and Mr. Guinness as a shriveled clergyman pull off as withering a comment on English stuffiness as one will ever see. Furthermore, it is in absolute good humor, which is the saving grace of the whole film.For the fact is that such a story of unmitigated contempt for the fundamental laws or society could only be tolerable when played as a spoof—a spoof on the highest level of cultivated humor and device. And that, thanks to all who made this picture—and to Mr. Guinness' incredible skill at vivid impersonation—is what this picture is.

I cannot comprehend how people hear unambiguous uplift in this work","excerpt":"to my ears, it is a far darker piece than the Shostakovich Fifth, whose ambivalence is so often touted.

This is unquestionably as powerful a straight dramatic talker as has come from Germany. \\"Ariane\\" had Elisabeth Bergner's fascination, \\"Storms on Mont Blanc\\" had stirring pictures of high mountains, \\"The Murder of Dimitri Karamasoff\\" had the terrifying depth of Dostoyefsky, but \\"Voruntersuchung\\" (Inquest) is more concise and dramatic than any of there. At its première at the Gloria Palast the audience was held from the first flicker.The main theme of the scenario is a conventional one: the judge who revises his attitude toward a case as soon as he realizes that a member of his family is intimately concerned in it. But it is treated so simply and naturally, with so much sincerity, that it seems as fresh as though it were used for the first time. The examining magistrate, who is the leading figure in the story, is a real human being who, for all his sardonic exterior, is essentially a tragic figure with whom we feel deeply. Also the student, Fritz Bernt, who is caught in the net of justice, is always sympathetic, although the authors, Max Arlsberg and Otto Hesse, have made no attempt at sugar coating. And the numerous minor characters are drawn with a cunning pen.A Plausible Murder Mystery.The plot itself is simple but effective. It savors of the murder mystery, but it is plausible and there is no attempt to elaborate it artificially. Fritz is in love with the daughter of an examining magistrate, but cannot ask for her hand because he is still mixed up with a girl from whom he cannot get free and who threatens to make a scandal if he leaves her. The magistrate's son, Walter, a fellow-student of Fritz's at the university, offers to go to the girl's apartment and break off the relationship for Fritz. So Fritz leaves his keys under the doormat for him. But Walter never gets to the apartment, as he spends the night with a married woman. Next day the girl is found murdered and Fritz is immediately suspected. The examining magistrate, the father of Fritz's sweetheart, has the case under him, but cannot get Fritz to tell what he did with his keys.As the examination proceeds he begins to suspect that his son may be mixed up in the matter, but fights down the idea and tries to force Fritz to confess. Then Walter is captured taking the keys from under the mat. As he will not tell where he spent the night, the magistrate is faced with the probability that his son has committed the murder. Now the magistrate's attitude toward the case changes. Instead of finding everything suspicious, as in the case of Fritz, he finds excuses for Walte is most suspicious actions. He realizes, however, that it will no longer be possible for him to conduct the inquest. But before he can resign some new and unexpected evidence discloses that a lodger in the neighboring apartment has murdered the girl while stealing a $1,000 inheritance which she had just received through the mail. The realization is driven home to the magistrate that the ways of legal procedure are not always identical with the ways of justice.And how simply and vigorously the cast played under the direction of Robert Siodmak! Albert Bassermann, who impersonated the magistrate, is perhaps a trifle old-fashioned, but he is still a great actor and he had moments that were positively electrifying. Gustav Fröhlich as Fritz was on the same level with him—at last a leading man who does not care a hoot for his appearance, but who can rise to a dramatic climax with magnificent power and sincerity. And in character rôles Edith Meinhardt, Julius Falkenstein and Herrman Speelmanns did as finished work as the German talker has yet had to offer us.Joe May's Limitations.And then there is the problem of Joe May, unquestionably one of the German directors who cannot be left out of consideration. Your feelings toward him are never lukewarm. His films are sometimes beneath critical consideration, but are manna to the box office. Again, they have very distinct artistic qualities and do not appeal to an average audience. His last film, \\"Und das ist die Hauptsache\\" (\\"That's All That Matters\\"), which just had its première at the Gloria Palast, is a mixture of both these categories: it has interesting and originally directed scenes mixed up with some deep genuflections to what is supposed to delight the heart of the servant girl. And the fans are left untouched.The main notion behind the film is not without originality and opened up all sorts of entertaining possibilities. At a typical Berlin ball a husband tells his wife that the best thing for them to do is to go their own ways for the evening, and he himself wanders off with a young girl on his arm. The wife is evidently not unmoved by his action and in desperate self-defense goes off with a young count. This youth, however, turns out to be an international swindler, who drugs her champagne and steals her jewelry. The police have been on the track of the crook and catch him before he can get away with his loot. In the meantime the husband has gone to the apartment of the girl, but has compunctions when he learns on the telephone that his wife has not returned home. So he dashes to his own apartment and waits feverishly for her return. When she comes to, the wife can hardly bring herself to return to her husband, but she finds him in a contrite mood and there seems no doubt that the matrimonial ship will now run a smoother course.In the first place, May had the possibility of creating the atmosphere of a Berlin ball with all its carnivalistic and reckless overtones. The actions of the dancers should have built up in fervor and sensuality, the lights should have dimmed and with them the intensity increased. Here was a chance to re-create a real twentieth century orgy—for the Berlin balls have more real carnivalistic virility than the better advertised events on the Riviera. But he missed this completely, the mood was the same throughout and the whole action was played in an even white illumination.Unrestrained Direction.And then one thing that May certainly cannot be accused of possessing is taste and delicacy. He has plenty of vigor and force and can often get wonderful results from a superficial mediocrity. But when he runs up against a player with emotional depth, he does not know how to hold him or her in. Nora Gregor, who plays the wife here, is one of that type","excerpt":"to my mind she has unlimited possibilities of expression, and there is no saying what she may not develop into. But her emotion lies very near the surface; she needs only a suggestion to bring it bubbling over. And May is not the man to shut down the throttle. He lets her emote his picture right off the screen. The scenes where she discovers that her husband intends to be unfaithful to her and when she wakes up after being doped by the crook are masterly, but they are so out of place in the light texture of the whole that they appear comic to the audience. Just a few grains of good taste might have saved the picture. And it certainly was worth saving for the exceptional performances of Miss Gregor, Ursula Grabley, a charming young comedienne who makes her début here, and Robert Thoeren as a glitteringly surfaced crook. I hope May will now decide to give us his best, which is certainly on the international top shelf.And then I have to report about a painful incident which took place at the Tauentzien Palast. This was the showing of the English version of \\"The Jumping Jack\\" (Der Hampelmann). A certain Thomas Digby of London had taken this Terra film and synchronized English dialogue to it. The original film was not very stirring, but it had the comic ability of such excellent comedians as Max Hansen, Szöke Szakall and Paul Heidemann to recommend it. But, when Digby got through, he had carefully extracted all the humor. The English voices he selected were, in most cases, totally unsuited to the personalities of the original actors. For instance, Hansen is a light comedian of the Ernest Truex type, with a tenor speaking voice and a pleasing dash of the Viennese accent. And for this, Digby substituted a heavy baritone voice whose possessor evidently had no idea of comedy. On top of that came the fact that most of the players spoke that sort of affected English which makes you believe that the tones are being strained through a large baked potato. I personally do not believe that we or the English would ever accept this sort of approximate synchronization, even if it were well done; but, handled in this amateur fashion, it is quite out of the question for first-class theatres.

To the best of my knowledge, the custom is strictly an American one.

As a first course, we recommend asparagus, cooked briefly and served warm with a shallot vinaigrette. As a starch, an accompaniment to the ham, we recommend a puree of sweet potatoes flavored with ginger preserves and chopped or broken walnuts.
