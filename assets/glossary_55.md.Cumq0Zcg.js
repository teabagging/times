After retiring from teaching in 1987, she pursued a career in fashion as a manufacturer and retailer of Balinese-inspired clothing.

Mr. Jenney was the fifth generation of the Jenney Family to head the family-owned Jenney Oil Company, Inc. which was founded in 1812. In the 1960's, Mr. Jenney spearheaded a successful drive to save the Old Colony Railroad when it discontinued service to the Massachusetts South Shore for Rail Mass Transportation. As an oilman this call for an alternative for transportation other than automotive highways was unique. Born in Boston in 1918, he graduated from Harvard University in 1941. He served in the U.S. Navy in World War II from 1941-1945 becoming a Lt. Commander. He served as a Director of three prominent New York Stock Exchange companies. He was a member of The World Presidents Organization and served as Director from 1973-1977 and President in 1976. As Chairman of the Francis Ouimet Scholarship Fund's effort, Mr. Jenney was instrumental in obtaining the issuance of a U.S. Commemorative Postage Stamp to honor Mr. Ouimet as America's first golf hero.
