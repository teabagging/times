Consider, for instance, the ripe strawberry. After it is spritzed, in the Italian manner, with balsamic vinegar, it loses its sweet and nubile affect, becoming tart -- and yet, in the opinion of many connoisseurs, delectably complex.    As a verb, ''to sour'' suggests that a food, or even a person, was once sweet, or at least neutral in flavor. Describing something as sour grapes is inescapably pejorative. In the same vein, sour milk is one thing and sour cream something else. When milk sours, it spoils. But to clabber, or sour, cream is to transform it actively, just as you do when you marinate or preserve a food.

(Touchstone/Simon & Schuster, $16.) Winning was absolutely everything for the Yankee Clipper, and he was uncommonly greedy, according to this debunking biography. Oh, and he could play baseball, too, with regal self-assurance. This well-researched portrait ''does succeed in knocking his halo askew . . . but it doesn't come close to cracking the mystery, or explaining the aura,'' of the iconic Yankee star, Wilfrid Sheed wrote here in 2000. Nonetheless, the book contains ''some provocative and very entertaining information.''    SO I AM GLAD, by A. L. Kennedy. (Vintage Contemporaries, $13.) How's this for an audacious premise: a 35-year-old radio announcer -- and practicing sadist -- is pulled back from the emotional brink by a May-December romance with a fellow loner who claims to have been Cyrano de Bergerac in a former life. The result is an ''oddly engaging novel by . . . one of the young stars of Scottish fiction,'' David Sacks said here last year, ''a love story that's highly imaginative and surprisingly poignant.''    THE KINDER, GENTLER MILITARY: How Political Correctness Affects Our Ability to Win Wars, by Stephanie Gutmann. (Encounter, $16.95.) The author argues that a politically driven campaign to transform the armed forces by integrating women has undermined American military readiness. Last year our reviewer, Carol Gilligan, called this ''an impassioned defense of the warrior culture and the vision of masculinity it sustains.''    LONGING, by J. D. Landis. (Ballantine, $14.95.) In this fictional biography, the Romantic composer Robert Schumann is portrayed as a wildly flamboyant absolutist in everything he touched. He died a pitiful death in an insane asylum after a short life spent indulging his twin obsessions with music and with the daughter of his piano teacher, whom he eventually married. The result is a ''strikingly original narrative'' that blends history with reflections on ''language and music, genius, imagination and the nature of human devotion,'' James Polk wrote here in 2000.    FALSE PAPERS, by Andr&#233","excerpt":"Aciman. (Picador USA, $13.) A poet of the city and of disappointed love examines his inner state of ''perpetual oscillation'' between wherever he is and the places he'd rather be -- mainly Paris, New York and Alexandria, Egypt, where he grew up. ''If he is fully alive anywhere, it is on the page -- as a writer, in his own pages, and also as a reader, in the pages of the writers he loves,'' Wendy Lesser said here last year.    THE MISSIONARY AND THE LIBERTINE, by Ian Buruma. (Vintage, $14.) These essays by a fluent translator of Asian ways to Western readers focus on cross-cultural perceptions (and misperceptions); he finds that the West's view of the East is still driven by stereotypes and that Asia is no longer that different from Europe and America. Buruma's ''instructive and entertaining'' book ''reinforces his reputation as a modern Orientalist with an original voice,'' Alan Riding said here in 2000.    THE NIGHT LISTENER, by Armistead Maupin. (Perennial/HarperCollins, $14.) The centerpiece of the author's first novel in eight years is the late-night telephone relationship that develops between the gay host of a radio talk show in San Francisco and a 13-year-old boy who is dying of AIDS. The result is ''a mystery studded with elegant twists and turns,'' Karen Karbo wrote in the Book Review last year. ''Who knew one of the sweetest writers in America, known for his gentle comedies of manners, could also spin a solid page turner?''    SLEEPLESS NIGHTS, by Elizabeth Hardwick. (New York Review, $12.95.) In this elegiac novel, which blends fiction with events and people from the author's own life, the narrator looks back on her Kentucky adolescence, her life in New York, Boston, Europe and stops in between, and the mysterious ''difference'' of being a woman in a world of disarray and suffering. The result is an ''extraordinary and haunting book'' that ''is less a 'story about' or 'of' a life than a shattered meditation on it,'' Joan Didion wrote here in 1979. The same publisher has reissued Seduction and Betrayal: Women and Literature ($12.95), Hardwick's iconoclastic survey of women writers -- among them Virginia Woolf, Sylvia Plath and the Bront&#235;s -- and women in fiction, like Ibsen's Nora and Hedda Gabler. In 1974 in these pages, Barbara Probst Solomon praised ''the high order of Hardwick's sensibility . . . and her subtle style'' as well as ''her superb writing.''
