Following are excerpts from Janet Maslin's review, which appeared in The New York Times on Oct. 2, 1992. The film, in Mandarin with English subtitles, opens today at the Lincoln Plaza Cinema, Broadway at 63d Street, with a rating of PG (Parental guidance suggested).   Zhang Yimou is the superb Chinese film maker whose life sounds like the stuff of legend (he is said to have \\"sold his blood to buy his first camera\\") and whose rural historical dramas (among them \\"Raise the Red Lantern\\" and \\"Ju Dou\\") would be accessible in any part of the globe. Now, in \\"The Story of Qiu Ju,\\" Mr. Zhang has attempted something more modern and no less fascinating. With the simplicity of a folk tale or a fable, he tells of a farmer's wife and her search for justice, and in the process he provides a remarkably detailed view of contemporary Chinese life.

The story, after creating plenty of merriment in the Warners' Theatre yesterday afternoon, comes to as abrupt an end as the great ape. The excuse for this is somewhat weak and, considering the hilarious episodes, something of a dénouement was to be expected.The gorilla in this film appears to have the run of a mansion, which, like every home for mystery pictures, has trap doors and sliding panels. Garrity and Mulligan, two sleuths, are engaged by Cyrus Stevens, the owner of the house, to solve the mystery of the gorilla's deadly work. They, like most film detectives, are jealous of one another. Mulligan, however, appears to dominate Garrity, who is persuaded to don the skin of a gorilla and go forth in search of the real brute.Garrity, realizing that his own life is in danger when it come to shooting the gorilla, wants to know how those with the guns are going to know him from the real gorilla. Mulligan solves this difficulty by putting a white ribbon round Garrity's neck when the latter is made up as a monster ape.It is, however, Mulligan who unexpectedly has the most exciting time. He is chased by a gorilla without a white ribbon around its neck. It follows him up a tree, and in vain does the sleuth cry put for his comrade. The real gorilla, evidently in a tantalizing mood, breaks of a high branch of a tree, and Mr. Mulligan plunges to the earth. The camera then looks around for Mr. Garrity, who is disclosed up another tree, smoking a cigar, looking perfectly comfortable until the real gorilla (or the one that is supposed to be real) comes along and insists on seating himself near the masquerading Garrity. That might not have been so bad, but in a playful mood the gorilla takes off Garrity's safety badge—the white ribbon—and puts it around its own neck!Quite a number of the turns were anticipated by some of the spectators, but this did not alter the fact that they enjoyed them when they came. Nobody could help laughing when the real gorilla was going around presumed to be Garrity and Garrity was being hunted as the monster. Fortunately he is able to get the \\"head\\" off, but even so in the dark he stands in danger of having a little lead pumped into him.Edwin Maxwell does well as Cyrus Stevens. Joe Frisco and Harry Gribbon serve out most of the fun in the respective rôles of Garrity and Mulligan. Lila Lee is the pretty girl of the case and Walter Pidgeon officiates as the man who knows more than the audience is told about the story.On the surrounding program is \\"Lost Gods,\\" a film record of Count de Prorok's expedition into ancient Carthage, Utica and Libya and other buried cities of Northern Africa.

The difference between these books is huge.

In a neighborhood that is frenetic, congested and sooty, this handsome trattoria is relaxed, airy and sparkling clean. What's more, the food fits the bill for the average Sunday diner: light, fresh and undemanding.

For main courses there are grilled swordfish with two sauces of red and yellow peppers and served with a warm fava bean salad; seared scallops on a fricassee of corn, tomato, zucchini and basil; linguine with baby Manila clams and a julienne of grilled vegetables; and shrimp and white-bean risotto.

Many are clean, satisfying and unquestionably cheap, if not much on atmosphere. For a step up in comfort but not in price, consider Menchanko-Tei, a sleek, 44-seat restaurant on West 55th Street with an eight-seat dining bar and a dozen black-lacquered tables.   The specialty here is home-style soups, a waitress once told us. Judging from the portions, the home she was referring to must have something to do with sumo wrestlers. A soup called menchanko comes out in a deep brass bowl and is a richly flavored broth filled with pressed bean curd, soba noodles, cabbage, sweet balls of fish cake, bean sprouts and other vegetables, all cooked until just al dente ($7.50). Another soup, kikuzo ramen, is made with squiggly fresh noodles, scallions, bamboo shoots, fish cake and delicious slices of lean roast pork ($6.50). All soups are served with big black bamboo spoons and chopsticks. Rice and Japanese pickles are traditional accompaniments. Sunday hours from 11:30 A.M. to 11:30 P.M.

Manhattan Ocean Club     57 West 58th Street, (212) 371-7777 -- The food at this handsome Midtown seafood house is beguiling, and the wine list is exceptionally well chosen and fairly priced. On Sunday night you might start with shrimp and escarole soup; lobster salad with couscous and Moroccan spices; seared tuna with potatoes and salsa verde; or warm sea urchins with curry and sauteed apples. Among entrees are red snapper with a rosemary crust; roast salmon with red wine sauce and sweet garlic; grilled swordfish served with braised red cabbage; and monkfish steak with deep-fried fennel. Desserts include a semisweet chocolate bag filled with white chocolate mousse; and butterscotch sundae on a pecan blondie. Appetizers range from $6.50 to $10.50; main courses are $21.50 to 29.50; desserts are $7.50 each. Sunday dinner hours are 5 to 11:30 P.M. (Review, June 10, 1988.)                    . . .

This description of winter in New England (and of the human reaction to it) is from \\"Here at Eagle Pond\\" by Donald Hall (Ticknor & Fields).    It's true -- if you don't have to drive in it -- that there are few things in Creation as beautiful as an icestorm. Much bad weather is beautiful: dark days when it never quite rains and never quite doesn't, English weather cozy around the fire","excerpt":"wild rains of summer after high heat, compensation and relief; drizzle in autumn that drains color from the trees, quiet and private; the first snow, which steps my heartbeat up; the first    big    snow, which steps it higher; winter thaw, with its hesitant promise; gothic thunderstorms with bolts of melodrama -- we quicken, we thrill, we comfort the dog.   Every now and then we have an open winter, as we call it when we have no snow; it's psychic disaster. . . . We don't deserve the milder air and the daffodils rising because we haven't lost our annual battles with the snow -- fender benders, bad backs from shoveling the mailbox, rasp of frozen air in the lungs, falls on ice, chunks of snow down our boots. The only bad weather in New England is when we don't have any. In Defense of Wandering      The Italian poet Petrarch wrote what must be one of the earliest (1352) and is still one of the most eloquent defenses of the wanderer's life. His droll letter to a friend is included in \\"The Voice of the Middle Ages: In Personal Letters 1100-1500,\\" edited by Catherine Moriarty (Peter Bedrick).      Whatever its origin, I know that in men's minds, especially in superior minds, resides an innate longing to see new places, to keep changing one's home. I don't deny that this longing should be tempered and held in bounds by reason. Your own experience will lead you to agree with me that this taste for wandering about the world mingles pleasure with its pains, while those who sit forever on one spot experience a strange boredom in their repose. Which is the better course, in this as in man's other problems? God alone knows. If one thinks that reward is not to be found in the spirit but in some particular place, if one calls immobility constancy, then the gouty must be extremely constant, and the dead are more constant still, and the mountains are the most constant of all. The Poem and the Poet's Body      Robert Bly laments the conceit, evident in some modern poetry, that poets should rigorously erase any semblance of the self from their work. This is from \\"American Poetry: Wildness and Domesticity\\" (HarperCollins).      Our recent poetry is also a poetry in which the poem is considered to be a construction independent of the poet. It is imagined that when the poet says \\"I\\" in a poem he does not mean himself, but rather some other person -- \\"the poet\\" -- a dramatic hero. The poem is conceived as a clock that one sets going. This idea encourages the poet to construct automated and flawless machines. Such poems have thousands of intricately moving parts, dozens of iambic belts and pulleys, precision trippers that rhyme at the right moment, lights flashing alternately red and green, steam valves that whistle like birds. . . . The great poets of this century have written their poems in exactly the opposite way. In the poems of Neruda, Vallejo, Jimenez, Machado, and Rilke, the poem is an extension of the substance of the man, no different from his skin or his hands. The substance of the man who wrote the poem reaches far out into the darkness and the poem is his whole body, seeing with his ears and his fingers and his hair. Magical, Meaningless 'Creativity'        The word creativity, Jacques Barzun argues, has been rendered meaningless by overuse and now serves to camouflage lazy, vague, unimaginative thinking. \\"The Paradoxes of Creativity\\" is included in \\"The Best American Essays 1990,\\" edited by Justin Kaplan (Ticknor & Fields).      In contemporary culture, no idea is so appealing, no word is put to more frequent and more varied use than \\"creativity.\\" In a new reference book of contemporary quotations, there are fifteen entries for Creativity and only three for Conversation, two for Wisdom, one for Contemplation, and none for Serenity or Repose. The magic of the word \\"creative\\" is so broad that no distinct meaning need be attached to it; it fits all situations, pointing to nothing in particular. . . . Creativity has become what divine grace and salvation were to former times. It is incessantly invoked, praised, urged, demanded, hoped for, declared achieved, or found lacking.  Listening to the Frogs      The best natural history writing begins with a writer's empathy for a species or landscape, as Adrian Forsyth demonstrates in this passage on frogs found in \\"Portraits of the Rainforest\\" (Camden House).      That the frog is an organism which reminds us of ourselves may explain why so many cultures have myths featuring the conversion of frogs into princes, sorcerers and other sorts of humans. But more than simple anatomical kinship, it is also a question of attitude that makes frogs endearing. Frogs, especially the tree frogs so common in rainforests, have a way of facing you with a goggle-eyed gaze that is disconcertingly humanoid. Their huge wrap-around mouths, while perhaps not actually resembling a smile, are certainly not frowning. Sitting hunched up as though in anticipation, they assume the posture and calm demeanour of patient listeners ready to participate in conversation. . . . Our emotional responses to these appealing features of frogs are not irrelevant. The art of natural history lies in allowing such personal reactions to organisms to lead us into their biology.

It houses 160 live animal species, including mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish and insects.     Exhibits illustrate various North American habitats, including deep woods, freshwater streams and open ocean, with a particular emphasis on the Ozarks. For example, a trip through the woods of the Ozarks features live and artificial trees, a 19-foot waterfall, and various species of migratory waterfowl and game birds. A 220,000-gallon saltwater tank includes sharks, stingrays and other fish. In the cave habitat, a colony of bats lives behind plexiglass, and models portray the lives of such other cave dwellers as crayfish, salamanders and blind cave fish.    Other exhibits focus on the skills needed for hunting, safe and legal hunting practices, and a historical look at hunting with displays of the museum's collection of guns and bows. Fishing enthusiasts can test their skill through computerized video simulators.    The museum, at 500 West Sunshine Street, at the corner of Campbell Street in Springfield, is open daily from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. except in summer when it is open till 8.
