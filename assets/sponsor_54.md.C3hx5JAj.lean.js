What she told Judge Ito during their 35-minute talk Wednesday revealed that long-feared racial divisions in the group were worse than anyone anticipated.   In the interview -- a transcript was released Thursday -- the 38-year-old black woman described how a kind of apartheid had developed in the sequestered jurors' lives.

The agreement with the six countries participating in the talks, is a preliminary one that would require future rounds of negotiations to flesh out, as it does not address a range of issues like timing and implementation.  A1    No Winner in German Election  After a bitterly fought campaign that many people in Germany had believed only a few days ago would produce a historic vote for change, the electorate failed to give any party or candidate a clear majority.  A1    In an election that produced no winner, Chancellor Gerhard Schr√∂der provided a facsimile of one, bounding to a stage to raucous applause, his hands clasped above his head in a victory gesture. Playing on the fears of change-averse Germans, he battled back from a deficit to bring his party to a virtual draw with the Christian Democrats.  A10    Afghan Voters Take Next Step  Millions of Afghans voted in the country's first contested legislative elections in more than a quarter of a century, the last formal step toward Afghanistan's transition to a democratic government following the American-led military ouster of the Taliban government nearly four years ago. Results of the vote are to be announced next month.  A1    Shiite Endurance Tested  Insurgents in Iraq have pointedly shifted their focus toward killing Shiite civilians, with the number of attacks rising sharply since the spring. If the country has not yet slid into open civil war, it is mainly because a vast majority of Shiites refused to be drawn into the killing.  A1    Uzbek Refugees Live in Fear  The 439 Uzbek refugees living in a United Nations camp in Romania still fear their government's reach. They are the largest group of survivors of what human rights groups say was a massacre at the hands of Uzbek security forces, who in May acted to put down an armed uprising in the city of Andijan, killing hundreds of people.  A3    NATIONAL  A16-21    Official Urges DelayOf New Orleans Return  Citing health and safety concerns, the top official in charge of the federal response to Hurricane Katrina recovery efforts urged a delay to a plan that is slowly bringing people back to a city largely without power, drinking water or a working 911 system.  A1    More than a quarter of the dead recovered so far in New Orleans are patients, mostly elderly, who died in hospitals or nursing homes, according to interviews with officials from eight area hospitals and 26 nursing homes. By the scores, people without choice of whether to leave or stay died in New Orleans, trapped in health care facilities and in many cases abandoned by their would-be government rescuers.  A1    Only now are searchers beginning to force their way into homes in a neighborhood just south of Lake Pontchartrain and part of the Gentilly section of New Orleans. While much of the rest of the city is drying out and making steps towards recovery, this mostly middle-class neighborhood's topography and promixity to a breach in the London Avenue Canal has made it the largest remaining swath of the city still under water.   A19    Former President Bill Clinton, asked by President Bush to help raise money for the victims of Hurricane Katrina, offered harsh public criticism of the Bush administration's disaster-relief effort, saying, ''You can't have an emergency plan that works if it only affects middle-class people up.''

The change in emphasis had been under serious discussion since late last month, but it was propelled Thursday, when it was reported that the June unemployment rate had surged to 7.8 percent.

Indeed, Latin American countries that have not engaged in some sort of border dispute are hard to find.

Billy Bob Thornton is Willie T. Stokes, a burned-out, hard-drinking safecracker who's annually roused from sleeping one off during the most wonderful time of the year by his dwarf partner, Marcus (Tony Cox). As Marcus works as a department store elf, he also cases the store so that he and Willie can break in and relieve the joint of valuable merchandise. On this tour, they've ended up in Phoenix, which just adds to the wealth of hilarious incongruity. As a director, Mr. Zwigoff has a taste for finding the dramatic power of self-loathing and making it entertainment. His previous films, the documentary &quot;Crumb&quot; and the his fiction-film debut &quot;Ghost World,&quot; both hinged on coping with epic tides of depression. &quot;Santa&quot; falls directly into that lineage. Mr. Thornton's face is drawn into a rictus of a snarl; his Willie anticipates trouble, and when it doesn't crop up on its own, he has to stir it up from the bottom of the pot.  Willie is filled with the most distorted kind of narcissism imaginable, and for Mr. Thornton, it functions as a kind of star chemistry. Willie ladles it generously on the kids who line up to see him on his wobbly perch on Santa's throne: he's the kind of minimum-wage offal who has sent his victims on to thousands of hours of therapy. ‚Äî  Elvis Mitchell This Santa Sobers Up, But Only For Greed"},{"year":"1990","title":"LEAD: To the Editor: On Judging a Nation by Its Playgrounds","excerpt":"Bad Science"},{"year":"1942","title":"Gov Harley dies","excerpt":"bad signed Appropriation Bill GOVERNOR HARLEY' OF SOUTH CAROLINA; Chief Executive Since Nov. 4, Who Succeeded to the Post on Maybank's Resignation, Dies LAST ACT SIGNING BILL Former Legislator. 61, Special Supreme Court Judge in '24, Barnwell' Mayor 10 Years"},{"year":"2004","title":"¬ëTHE PASSION¬íI¬íll Take PasoliniTo the Editor:. ¬íThe Passion¬í","excerpt":"Bad Singing; ¬íPeter Grimes¬í; Balanchine; Hollywood¬ís Ills"},{"year":"1989","title":"LEAD: In the one moving scene in David Hare's new play, ''The Secret Rapture'' - the last - the audience is suddenly overwhelmed by pity for a young woman it has hated all night long.

The crop is also suffering because many of the honeybees that farmers rely on to pollinate their crops are being killed by  mites from Asia, said Bob Cooper, a consultant with the Gloucester County Agriculture Extension Service.

As befits a play about the state of the nation, not to mention civilization, in the dispiriting year of 1992, the man mangles the pledge's words. Not that he cares. The man in question, an English-born psychiatrist named Graydon Massey, would rather stare narcissistically at himself in the mirror, puff on a cigar and try on different ties. Though he is expected to give a patriotic speech at the party celebrating his naturalization as an American citizen, he is in Malibu, after all. At the end of the day, what will really matter to his well-wishers: his choice of words or his choice of Armani?    Mr. Baitz's answer to that question is not remotely in doubt. \\"The End of the Day\\" offers a bleak yet hilarious portrait of a present-day world in which only money talks: in politics, business, medicine, culture and the privacy of one's own home. What is also not in doubt is Mr. Baitz's extraordinary talent. At the age of 30, this playwright now has two provocative, compulsively watchable plays running in New York City, and this one, like its predecessor, \\"The Substance of Fire,\\" is marked both by the structural gropings of a fledgling craftsman and the aching articulation, scathing wit and deep convictions of a mature artist with a complete vision. \\"The End of the Day\\" also shares its predecessor's good fortune in receiving a wonderful production at Playwrights Horizons.

Baker 3d took a grand tour of the Middle East and Moscow last week to see whether that victory could be translated into a breakthrough in the Arab-Israeli conflict as well.   What he found, in many ways, was that the connection between events in the gulf and the future of the Arab-Israel dispute is uncertain. Everyone Mr. Baker spoke to was long on optimism, but short on specific promises. It was as if there had been an earthquake in Kuwait and Iraq that turned the world there upside down and prompted nearby governments to act in ways they had never before contemplated. But the Arabs and Israelis down the street got hit with only the aftershocks. It has rattled their diplomatic teacups and unnerved some people, but a survey of the main Arab-Israeli players with whom Mr. Baker spoke last week shows that -- for now -- their world and their attitudes remain mostly intact. Here is a look at what Mr. Baker found. ISRAEL     Israel Radio, describing the political scene at home the other day, referred to the veteran hard-liner Ariel Sharon -- then went to say, \\"and then to the right of him . . .\\" When Mr. Sharon no longer defines the right edge of Israeli politics, it means there are some awfully angry Israelis. Moshe Arad, Israel's former Ambassador to Washington who returned home five months ago, said he has found that everyone used the gulf war to prove what they already believed. \\"Everything is the same only the feelings of people are cruder, sharper, more raw,\\" he said.

So here are 20 half-baked ideas for columns I might have actually written in a cooler season:    1. DUMB BACK-TO-SCHOOL STUFF -- I'm not sure what this has to do with New Jersey, but some marketing outfit sent me a boxful of new products for the fashionable student, most ridiculous among them PaperMate antibacterial pens. Yes, antibacterial pens. But note: ''Antibacterial technology is designed to protect the pen's surface and does not extend protection to the skin,'' the package explains. Apparently the idea is to prevent the pen itself from getting a cold. Also in the box: an ''Auto Advance Mechanical Pencil,'' which ''ensures you'll never have to click to advance the lead in a mechanical pencil again.'' Just when you thought Americans couldn't be lazier, we can't even exert the energy to click a mechanical pencil.    2. WORST T-SHIRT OF THE SUMMER -- Seen in Seaside Heights, it said, ''What happens in Seaside Heights stays in Seaside Heights.'' What grates about this is not just that we're so lame we have to steal another city's catchphrase. It's that nothing ever happens in Seaside Heights. Which brings us to another column:    3. LET'S FACE IT: THE JERSEY SHORE IS BORING -- Ratty amusement parks with ancient rides; the same five unappetizing foods being sold at stand after stand; unattractive bods on the beach. Ugh. Shut it down.    4. NEW JERSEY: THE OBTUSE STATE -- Not long ago two state assemblymen, Jon M. Bramnick and Gordon M. Johnson, introduced a resolution encouraging us ''to treat one another civilly.'' But in my experience, our biggest problem isn't the occasional raising of the middle finger; it's that average New Jerseyans seem incapable of recognizing their own thoughtless behavior or that it might affect people around them. Case in point: A newspaper columnist is riding the train into the city. The people in the seat in front of him have a boy, maybe 3 years old, who apparently has never been on a train and who has one of those earsplitting kiddie voices. Inexplicably, they let him hang over the seat back and look out the columnist's window for the entire hourlong trip, during which he continually shouts ''MOMMY! LOOK AT THAT!'' directly into the columnist's face, at a distance of two feet.    5. NEW JERSEYANS: NOT AS BRIGHT AS WASHINGTONIANS -- In Washington, where I once lived, everyone who rides the subway seems to have mastered a simple escalator rule: stand to the right, so that people in a hurry -- neurosurgeons with patients waiting on the operating table, for instance -- can scurry up the left side. But on the New Jersey Transit platforms at Penn Station in New York, the first two arriving New Jerseyans to reach a given escalator will stop dead side by side. They'll thereby clog the way for hundreds of people behind them, causing the deaths of countless neurosurgery patients. (These same two people, at the top of the escalator, will take one step and again stop dead to discuss where to eat lunch, while behind them the escalator continues to disgorge fellow passengers who, having no room to exit, are ground up like hamburger in the stairway's powerful mechanism.)    6. WHAT HAPPENED TO THE YAMS? -- My favorite headline of the year so far was on a news brief moved in February by The Associated Press out of Port Elizabeth: ''Customs Agents Find Over 6 Tons of Marijuana in Yam Shipment.'' The pot was seized; the fate of the yams remains unclear.    7. THE E-ZPASS CONSPIRACY -- The printing on Turnpike tickets has become so teeny that it can be read only with an electron microscope, a plot to force the last holdouts to cave in and get E-ZPass. And E-ZPass, of course, was created by a secret government agency whose mandate is to track our movements and, eventually, control us through signals sent by satellite to our E-ZPass tags, cellphones and iPods.    8 THROUGH 16. NINE THINGS I'M TIRED OF HEARING ABOUT -- Bears. Deer. McMansions. Whether Camden can revitalize itself. Whether Newark can revitalize itself. Whether Atlantic City can revitalize itself. Whether Asbury Park can revitalize itself. Whether Christie Whitman can revitalize herself. Springsteen.    17. ANAGRAMS FROM STATE LEGISLATORS' NAMES -- Linda Greenstein: straining needle.

Based on an episode in Moliere's \\"Bourgeois Gentilhomme,\\" the work is essentially a divertissement that pretends to have an outline of a plot. Balanchine, despite such pitfalls, choreographed three versions of \\"Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme\\": in 1932, 1944 and 1979, on commission for the New York City Opera. The last staging was conceived as a vehicle for Rudolf Nureyev, who portrayed the 17th-century parvenu attempting to learn the arts of a gentleman.

The ballet, presented by the New York City Ballet in a richly satisfying performance on Saturday afternoon, is essentially about the good manners and vital graciousness of the world of Mozart's music. It is also a prime example of the sensitivity to music that shaped much of Balanchine's choreography. And almost everyone in the cast gets a chance to shine.    Some of the best dancing came from Robert Lyon and Erlends Zieminch, each seen here in a role debut as the male demi-soloists. One pleasure of the City Ballet season has been watching finished classical dancing travel through Mr. Lyon's long body down through his tapering hands and feet. Mr. Zieminch proved himself here to be the kind of partner who looks, deceptively, as if all his passion and exaltation flows from his proximity to his ballerina. He danced with an impressive buoyancy and a quality of attention to style that softened occasional distracting moments of loose light-weightedness.

Stephanie Saland had some moments of melting lyricism and Ben Huys danced with a welcome vigor that cut a sharp path. But for the most part the dancing looked rushed, out of touch and a little ragged. Russell Kaiser and Nilas Martins danced the theme.

In recent years, however, growing complaints about unnecessary cruelty have made animal research a national issue. Last year, Congress expanded enforcement of the Animal Welfare Act, required training for workers who handle animals and gave the National Institutes of Health the right to revoke Government money if violations are found. This month Federal financing for some animal studies at Columbia University was suspended because they failed to meet new rules. Last week, panels of the National Academy of Sciences that are investigating animal research heard testimony from more than 50 scientists, animal-rights activists and other interested parties.

FALSE PROMISES The mere fact that we are attending a scientific hearing concerning the use of animals in research indicates how, in the past decade, the legitimacy of the animal rights argument is being seriously considered. Many scientists are questioning not only accepted assumptions concerning the use of animals in research but also the merits of basic research itself.

Both John Coltrane and Miles Davis spent a good part of the decade repudiating the obviousness of hard-bop emotionalism, allowing fragility and liability to become esthetic assets.
