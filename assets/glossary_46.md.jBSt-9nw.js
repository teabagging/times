But sometimes the differences between the elements of an analogy are more important than the similarities. The surging stock market against the background of a weakening economy today forces some economists to see an analogy with 1929. However, consider these differences:   - Knowledge of how to use monetary and fiscal policy to avoid a downward spiral is far more secure today.

There is Rudolf Nureyev's ''Don Quixote,'' in repertory in Paris-Vienna-Oslo-Zurich-Verona, which is about to be toured around the United States in the spring by the Boston Ballet.  There is the Paris Opera Ballet's 1979 reconstruction of ''Sylvia'' - danced, incidentally, in the same version by the Peking Ballet - which is scheduled for an American premiere in March by the Washington Ballet.   A selective armchair survey of Europe's dance season, frequently ignored here, seems to be very much in order. The overall trends are clear enough. One is, as the Swedish critic, Erik Naslund, lamented in Dance News, ''that one sees the very same merchandise, whether watching ballet in Copenhagen, London, Berlin, Zurich, Vienna or Amsterdam.''

Highly awarded Washington Post Sports Reporter 1945-2006 A Family's Memories. He started every day by asking his daughters ''Are you doing what is right in your heart?'' and he lived his life the same way. To their replies, he never said ''What I would have done if I were you...'' believing that people never get to be anybody but who they are. Those who couldn't see past Mark's physical condition no doubt wondered how he unfailingly answered ''Great!'' (with a big smile) when asked ''How are you?'' But the explanation was simple: Mark only wanted people to see through his less-than-healthy body to the healthy, vibrant presence inside. In turn, Mark gave what he wanted: acceptance. When a companion reacted negatively to two men holding hands, Mark replied ''Isn't it wonderful that we're in America where they can do that in public?'' And when he couldn't make his points gently, Mark battled. Society's treatment of people with disabilities and other inequities became his causes. His love for life showed in his love for food. If he hadn't been a sports reporter, Mark would have wanted to be a food critic. There was hardly a restaurant he hadn't visited. During his last days, when Mark couldn't drink or eat and his family told him they could not enjoy eating, he said, ''Eat all the foods that I love for me and that will make me happy.'' Mark won numerous awards from the Associated Press Sports Editors Association: 1983 -1st Place, Best News Story","excerpt":"1985 -5th Place, Best Enterprise Reporting; 1986 -2nd Place, Best Enterprise Reporting; 1986 -2nd Place, Best Investigative Reporting; 1990 -Best Sports News Story; and 1996 -4th Place, Best Enterprise Reporting. He was a Pulitzer Prize finalist in 1986, won the 1990 Associated Press's Chesapeake Mark Twain Award for Outstanding Achievement in sports coverage, the 1997 Society of Professional Journalists' Washington Dateline Award for Excellence in Local Journalism, and the 2002 U.S. Basketball Writers Association's Katha Quinn Award. He was a Washington Post Duke University Fellow from 1989-90. NBA Commissioner David Stern once called Mark ''The Murray Chass of the Washington Post.'' The last few years of Mark's professional life were difficult. While grateful for the support of those who knew what he could still do, Mark felt the Post's changing culture brought in some people who only saw his disabilities. But to the end, as his beloved daughters, Lizzie and Melanie, and devoted wife, Elizabeth, fondly recall, Mark still replied to some of their calls with the classic reporter's line: ''I have to call you back. I'm on deadline.'' Mark reluctantly retired on November 1, 2005. Asked by his children when he would have wanted to retire, Mark replied ''I would like to have died in the newsroom.''

First off the mark in New York was the Choir of Corpus Christi Church, whose annual Festival of Lessons and Carols took place on Sunday afternoon. Only two works by Palestrina were heard, but the overall selection of sacred music, mingled with the reading of scriptural texts, gave an intelligent picture of the 16th-century world over which Palestrina presided.

That reflex is surely behind the drive to discourage shareholder lawsuits -- a battle that has inundated innocent civilians lately with a barrage of advertising. Brokers and accountants, emboldened by the Republicans strutting their stuff, have pushed for a law to limit lawsuits, saying many suits are frivolous. Consumer groups have countered with ads cautioning that small investors would be left with little recourse if they were duped. But anti-lawyer fever is clearly strong these Republican days, and last week the Senate approved the measure with a veto-proof 70-29 vote.  INSIDER TRADING Too Tempting to Resist If the money's lying there, they will take it -- whether it's theirs or not. That seemed to be the lesson last week when a former Cravath, Swaine & Moore senior associate, and his brother, pleaded guilty to insider trading. There is a lot of money lying around these days -- in the form of advance information about the current flurry of mergers. And cases of insider trading are growing in tandem. Until now Cravath had prided itself on keeping its nose clean, but this lawyer passed on information that resulted in trading profits of nearly $1 million. Now you'd think that someone who'd reached such professional heights had it made (if by \\"it\\" you mean money), but the siren song was clearly too loud.  MUNICIPAL FINANCE A County Circles Its Oranges A lot of people are against taxes, but Orange County voters surely take the prize. Last week they refused to approve a mere half-percent emergency sales tax increase, even though this defiant stand nudged them toward a rather messy abyss. The county's in bankruptcy, its debt is now in default, a state takeover looms, and it's far from clear how the trash will be collected and the students taught. Couldn't the county issue more bonds to make it all better? Right. A fellow here has a nice bridge to sell to those bond buyers. And perhaps worse, municipal bonds all over the place have gotten a black eye.  HEALTH CARE The H.M.O. Giant Is Coming H.M.O.'s are coming. Yes, yes, they've been here for some time, but now they'll really be a force to reckon with. Last week United Healthcare, an H.M.O. giant based in Minnesota, agreed to buy Metrahealth, a more traditional insurer. Metrahealth, carved recently out of the Met Life and Travelers health businesses, has 10 million customers, including 1.5 million in the New York area. The merger with United Healthcare will create the nation's largest health-plan company. So if H.M.O.'s have always seemed a distant concept -- somewhere else, affecting someone else -- that is sure to change in a hurry.  TOBACCO Keeping Minors From Smoking Let's see. Philip Morris wants to sell cigarettes -- that's its business. And most smokers start when they are teen-agers. Yet last week the company said it would go all out to keep minors from smoking. (Well, not exactly all out: the plan will cost $5 million","excerpt":"1994 profits were $4.7 billion.) Highlights of the program are a national ad campaign, warnings that say \\"Underage Sale Prohibited,\\" and the end of promotional giveaways. What this means (choose one): a) Philip Morris, in a stunning about-face, actually wants fewer people to smoke, or b) \\"They are scared,\\" as an American Heart Association spokesman said, and want to undercut efforts to regulate tobacco as a drug and head off state efforts to clamp down on sales to minors.  CORPORATE DIRECTORS Part Time. High Pay. Perks. Do directors earn their often-substantial pay? With corporate austerity all the rage, many shareholders (whose jobs, perhaps, were devoured by that omnivorous austerity) have been asking just that. So Graef Crystal, a pay guru who clearly relishes tackling such questions, took a look. In a report out last week, he found a huge range in 1994 board pay, from $3,600 at Berkshire Hathaway to $180,700 at Roadway Services -- or, as he put it more tersely, \\"It's a mess.\\" He created a formula for defining how much is too much, and in what was surely a string of amazing coincidences, he found many companies at which both directors and chief executives -- who scratch each other's wallets -- were significantly overpaid.  WORKPLACE The 24-Hour-a-Day Fast Track It's easy to fantasize about a $1 million-plus salary, the freedom from worry (No more credit-card interest!) the money would bestow. But such a salary could be a thief of freedom, too. If you worked, say, for Ronald Perelman, you might be on call morning and night, weekday and weekend. That was fine with Fred Tepperman -- until his wife got Alzheimer's. Then he needed more time at home, and soon lost his job as Mr. Perelman's chief financial officer. The company said he \\"willfully failed to devote to his employer his entire time, energy and skill,\\" while Mr. Tepperman insists it was no more than missing a few breakfast meetings to care for his wife. The courts will now decide who's right, for Mr. Tepperman has sued for more than $25 million in damages.  TAKEOVERS How Does It Feel, Mr. Pickens? Takeover artists -- they're almost-mythic corporate rough riders, swooping in on pot-bellied managers, kicking them with their studded boots, and snarling, \\"Get with it or get out!\\" Such raiders, a breed apart, would surely never be on the receiving end of those kicks. Or would they? One fabled marauder of the wild 80's was one T. Boone Pickens -- the very name conjures images of a man who eats rusty nails with his steak. But sure enough, last week two big investors took aim at Mr. Pickens's natural gas company, Mesa, chanting the old raiders' chant: \\"Enhance shareholder value.\\" And suddenly it was Mr. Pickens with his back to the saloon wall, for one of those investors is none other than Marvin Davis, the California billionaire.

It's all buzz, instead of buzz-kill this time &#151; and superficially enjoyable, though not nearly as rich or resonant (or, for that matter, as memorable) as his other work. He's drawn toward stories of alienation and anguish, though they're generally rendered in unrelieved, hypnotic tableaus of stoicism punctuated by outbursts of anguish &#151; underscaled family tragedy with a hint of adrenaline. There's always a young person looking for an answer to a question better off unasked. Here, it's the sylph-like club hostess Vicki (Shu Qi), whose radiant smile and dimples are like all the lights in the room being fired up simultaneously. Vicki's spirits are being broken like an undernourished bull by a series of boyfriends, the DJ Hao-hao (Tuan Chun-Hao) and, later, the gangster Jack (Kao Jack) &#151; who does everything but play &quot;The Blueprint&quot; so it's clear exactly where he lives. That's only because rap isn't part of the musical purview of &quot;Mambo&quot;: the insistence of high-throb electronica calls out to Vicki, so that she pounds the thoughts out of her head. She runs to Jack, to whom she's attracted because of his nurturing side; for Vicki, he's a romantic version of mobster noblesse oblige. Mr. Hou makes an impressive case for the lure of drum and bass for Vicki &#151;  the music enlivens his reflexes, though he's not driven to make the emotional underpinning of the story as rich as he generally does. The soap opera stuff in &quot;Mambo&quot; isn't even as dense as the music.  Working with the screenwriter Chu Tien-Wen and the cinematographer Mark Lee Ping-Bing, the director has made a film that feels like an episode of  &quot;The O.C.&quot; directed by Wong Kar Wai: a pretty attractive concept, come to think of it. Some of the sequences &#151;  especially those contrasting her moribund life at home with Hao-hao versus getting her pupils dilated at the clubs &#151;  have a startling staying power.  Mr. Hou has a gift for vibrant shocks that roam around in an audience's head for years. When that singularly perverse capacity of his isn't connected to something more substantial, it seems a waste.

Auctions, too, have had a major effect on this market. Until 10 years ago, most of these styles were rarely, if ever, seen at auction. Only John Henry Belter's elaborately carved rococo designs appeared with regularity on the auction block. That began to change in 1978 when Sotheby Parke Bernet inaugurated its Victorian International auctions - large sales that began with 500 offerings and grew to 1,300 lots and included crockery, decorations, silver, cut glass, bronzes and furniture.

Only a few years ago, Jane's Addiction was a promising rock band on the college circuit. Often when a band steps up to the arena level, it can't translate. But Jane's Addiction can. It played an exciting set loaded with funk and rock riffs, stretching out and letting its sound rumble and spread out through the auditorium. Basing many of its pieces on bass lines, the band kept all its musical components simple and distinct.
