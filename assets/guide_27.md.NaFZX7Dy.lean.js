The entire dance floor on Saturday was a typhoon of slamming bodies, colorful tattoos and airborne leaflets for future concerts by local bands. Audience members dove off the stage four at a time as Biohazard flailed at its guitars. Billy Graziadei, the singer and guitarist, yelled rhythmically, as if he were punching lyrics out of his diaphragm. He kept perfect time with Danny Schuler's rapid drumbeat.

The European birch (Betula pendula) is the most widely planted. Its growth habit is pyramidal when young, but it becomes oval as it matures. It will ultimately reach 40 to 50 feet in height. Its smooth, white bark is chalky white. With age, it becomes marked with black fissures. The branches have a tendency to be pendulous, hence the species name, and some cultivars are quite weeping. One of the best and most durable forms is ''Youngii,'' a rather smallish form with an open center and weeping habit.
