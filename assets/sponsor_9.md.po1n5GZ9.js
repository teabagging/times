The result is a heterogenous collection of odd bits of familiar material warped into a merely passable picture.George O'Brien plays Billy West, \\"topper\\" in a Canadian lumber camp. Early in the picture he sees murder being committed by two fur thieves. The rest of the tale concerns the efforts of the murderers to remove, by foul means rather than fair, the sole witness to the deed.Helen Chandler as Marna Reynolds, the trader's daughter, furnishes the love interest. Miss Chandler is a winsome young woman whose pleasant acting shows that she is capable of better things than are offered her in this \\"epic of the North.\\"Near the close of the picture, West is shot through the shoulder. The wound seems serious, as he is delirous throughout the night, but the next morning he is seen using his arm as freely as ever, if not more so. He engages in a fight, swims a boiling river and saves Marna from being crushed in a log-jam. Which just shows what fresh air, good food and clean living will do for one's health.A bit of human interest is contributed by a new light on the familiar mail-order catalogue. Marna waxes lyrical over dress No. 3,469 and confesses to her father that she likes the man in illustration 854 better than the one in 327. This simplicity, which tones the entire film, should make it pleasant entertainment for those who like that sort of thing.Other Photoplays.\\"With Byrd at the South Pole\\" will be presented on Friday evening at the Rialto.At the Fifty-fifth Street Playhouse the feature is \\"Hungarian Nights,\\" a German silent film.\\"Cain and Artem,\\" a Russian silent film, is at the Cameo.The Fifth Avenue Playhouse is exhibiting until tomorrow an old silent film, \\"At the South Pole\\"","excerpt":"City Girl\\" will be at that theatre until Saturday.\\"Alibi,\\" with Chester Morris, is at the Little Picture House today; \\"Montana Moon\\" will be seen from Tuesday until Thursday.\\"Redemption\\" is at the Little Carnegie Playhouse until tomorrow; \\"Young Man of Manhattan\\" will be on view the latter part of the week.\\"The Lady of Scandal\\" is at the Capitol; \\"The Social Lion,\\" at the Paramount; \\"Mamba,\\" at the Roxy; \\"Hold Everything,\\" at the Warners' Strand; \\"The Bad One,\\" at the Rivoli; \\"The Rogue Song,\\" at the Astor; \\"All Quiet on the Western Front,\\" at the Central; \\"The Silent Enemy,\\" at the Criterion; \\"Journey's End,\\" at the Gaiety; \\"Beau Bandit,\\" at the Globe; \\"Song of the Flame,\\" at the Warners'; \\"Ladies in Love,\\" at the Warners' Beacon; \\"Bride of the Regiment,\\" at the Warners' Hollywood, and \\"Numbered Men,\\" at the Winter Garden.

There was no gala concert with stars returning to pay tribute to the company they once sang with, stars like Samuel Ramey, Placido Domingo, Carol Vaness and Frederica von Stade. There was no attempt to open the season with a major revival of a neglected work the City Opera had championed during its half-century of life: a work like \\"The Rake's Progress\\" or \\"A Midsummer Night's Dream\\" or \\"Street Scene\\" or \\"Six Characters in Search of an Author.\\" Christopher Keene, the general director, did not conduct, and there was no honoring of the company's American character with a native work and cast.

This topic has been a staple of critical discussion ever since the company's inception in 1944, but has become an obsession with analysts since the City Opera moved from West 55th Street to Lincoln Center in 1966. The original idea was to provide moderate-priced opera for the mythic character that politicians in the euphoric 40's called the Common Man. To a surprising extent, the plan worked, too. However, keeping the democratic flame burning brightly has become increasingly more difficult in the marbled precincts of Lincoln Center. With the comparatively wealthy and socially upscale neighbor, the Metropolitan Opera, only a few yards away across the plaza, the temptation on the City Opera's part has been to try to compete, both artistically and financially, with the grande dame. And the temptation for critics to compare the two companies, almost invariably to the detriment of the one with the smaller budget, has not been resisted. That is hardly fair or sensible.
