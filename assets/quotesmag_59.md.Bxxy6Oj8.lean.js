During the heaviest struggle in Britain's history, Carol Reed and a band of first-rate players have found the mental tranquillity to make a gently satirical portrait of Victorian caste and snobbery. H. G. Wells's \\"Kipps,\\" now at the Little Carnegie, is hardly, one would say, a film for the present moment. It lacks highly colored drama. Its climaxes, if they can be called that, are politely spoken. The foibles it satirizes are no longer important targets. But within the narrow compass of the story Mr. Reed has revealed each detail with all the art of a miniaturist's hand and his actors have responded beautifully. It is more than a simple period piece. Although it has the innocent and old-fashioned charm of a bouquet of wax roses under a glass bell it conceals a few thorns.Mr. Reed has already shown himself as no ordinary director. In revealing character, his touch is sharp and swift. And to compensate for the weak dramatic pulse of Mr. Wells's story of a Victorian draper's apprentice who inherited sudden wealth and the duties of a \\"gentleman,\\" Mr. Reed has had the wisdom to accent, to caricature the stuffy society into which Kipps momentarily was thrust. Shalford, the draper, very pompous and precise","excerpt":"Chitterlow, the jolly theatrical enterpreneur of haphazard ethics; Coote, the mincing and glutinous director of a school for uplift and \\"self-improvement\\"—these and others, such as the roaring duet at a seaside band pavilion, Mr. Reed has shown with whimsical exaggeration.As Kipps, the nobody who suddenly found that he had to \\"live up to a position,\\" Michael Redgrave's portrait of fumbling simple-mindedness again shows him to be one of Britain's shrewdest actors. Diana Wynyard is all coolly poised loveliness as the school teacher with social ambitions, and Phyllis Calvert gives a tender performance as the little serving girl to whom Kipps finally returns. Other rôles are broadly and amusingly played—Arthur Riscoe as Chitterlow, Lloyd Pearson as Shalford and Max Adrian as Coote. But for all the talents that have gone into it, \\"Kipps\\" is perilously thin for its length. It is a five-finger exercise for a brilliant director and a talented cast, and not a great deal more.

Lasker Swimming Pool and Skating Rink   Central Park  Harlem Meer (south of 110th Street)  Manhattan  (212) 534-7639  Recommended for all ages    Spotting the Lasker pool from afar, one child thought the turquoise vision was a mirage. And it's true that from a distance on a humid morning, this 28-year-old pool, set amid the greenness of the park, seems unreal. Thankfully, it is very real, having recently reopened after a $2.8 million renovation.   The water sparkles and seems extra clean, probably because the pool has a new, more efficient filtration system","excerpt":"chlorination, formerly done manually, is now performed automatically, Vijay Gupta, the renovation project's chief mechanical engineer, explained. Unsightly concrete walls and gutters have been replaced with sleek stainless steel, and access ramps, showers and water fountains for the disabled have been added. The tulip and cascade fountains, which hadn't worked in about five years, now gush like geysers, making splashy kiddie pools.   But what most children care about is feeling carefree. Travis Lee, a 9-year-old who lives nearby, said it's a great pool because it's not too deep and he feels safe. (And the lifeguards are easy to spot in their neon-orange outfits.)   There are lockers (take your own lock), a snack bar and stadiumlike seating. Hours: 11 A.M. to 7 P.M. daily through Sept. 5. Attendance at city pools drops in August, so the pool is likely to be uncrowded, especially before noon and after 5 P.M. Ferry Ride   NY Waterway  World Financial Center  West Street (between Vesey and Liberty Streets)  Lower Manhattan  (800) 53-FERRY  Monday through Friday    A lot of ferries zip across the Hudson River from Manhattan and New Jersey docks, but only one takes you from the World Financial Center to the Colgate clock at Exchange Place in Jersey City. Indeed, the ride from Manhattan, where you can see the oversize clock across the water, drops you off almost under the timepiece. It's a brief (five minutes) but glorious voyage from state to state, brisk enough to leave your hair looking like meringue if you sit on the ferry's open deck.   The clock sits on a large structure that looks like scaffolding, next to a sign that reads \\"Colgate\\" in red letters. Up close, looking at the large minute and hour hands, which are black with red in the middle, you understand what it must have felt like to be a Lilliputian.   When we arrived on a recent visit, the clock read 3:27 P.M.; we watched the minute hand move, ever so slowly, to 3:28 P.M. There are rungs around the clock face so that the repairman can make his way around (a tiny shed, way up high in back of the clock, might be, we figured, where that person lives.) We then walked through the adjacent parking lot to Exchange Place and a pier called the J. Owen Grundy Park. One man was fishing and had caught one, which he said he would feed to his cat. By the time we were back at the clock, it read 4:09 and a young visitor said, \\"We've been through a lot of minutes.\\"   The Colgate-World Financial Center ferry runs only on weekdays and leaves about every 15 minutes from Manhattan, starting at 6:52 A.M. and continuing until 9:45 P.M. Children 6 and under ride free; the round-trip fare for adults is $4. On Saturdays and Sundays, ferries depart from the World Financial Center for Hoboken or Liberty State Park in New Jersey. 'Brooklyn Dodgers'   Brooklyn Historical Society  128 Pierrepont Street (at Clinton Street)  Brooklyn Heights  (718) 624-0890  Recommended ages: 5 and up    At least one 6-year-old boy in the baseball universe continues to look at the newspaper every day as if the major league games were still churning along. He also talks about how Paul O'Neill (a Yankee) and Rico Brogna (of the Mets) are faring, as if they were still playing. So in the continuing effort to stave off reality, we visited this show devoted to the long-ago Brooklyn Dodgers, who left in 1957 for Los Angeles.   Here's what the young fan considered important: a 10-cent comic-book cover depicting Jackie Robinson, as well as a picture of him as he signed on as a Dodger in 1947; a Pee Wee Reese baseball card; a base from Ebbets Field; the mitt Mickey Owen used in the fourth game of the 1941 World Series; a newspaper photograph of Ebbets Field being demolished by a wrecker's ball and assorted Dodger uniforms, bats and gloves.   This is but a small part of a permanent exhibition on Brooklyn neighborhoods and history, yet it could be significant for someone suffering the baseball-strike blues. (For a few guffaws, you should also seek out the funny mirror, circa 1920, in the Coney Island section.) The society is open Tuesday through Saturday, noon to 5 P.M. Admission is $2.50 for adults and $1 for children; free for all on Wednesdays. Summergarden   The Museum of Modern Art  The Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Sculpture Garden  14 West 54th Street  Manhattan  (212) 708-9491  Recommended for all ages  Through Aug. 27    Not even the warning of thunderstorms could keep one family from venturing out last Saturday night in the city, and it wasn't to see \\"The Lion King.\\" (That had been done the night before.) The parents were desperate for high culture -- the Summergarden classical-music concerts at the Museum of Modern Art, in this case -- and were even optimistic that the children might appreciate it (or, at worst, be lulled to sleep).   But the thunderstorm got in the way and the concert was canceled. The family returned home in the rain, uninspired and unhappy. Maybe another family will have better luck this weekend or next. The concerts, performed by musicians from the Juilliard School, are in their eighth year; the theme this summer is early 20th-century music.   \\"It's not fairy-tale music,\\" said Sheila Porter, the concert's publicity agent, \\"but some kids really dig the music.\\" The informality of Summergarden has, in fact, been attracting families (including infants, Ms. Porter said), even though it makes for a late evening. (The free concerts begin at 8:30 and end by 10 P.M.) There are no formal intermissions, but brief gaps between pieces allow families to make swift, discreet exits, if necessary. Just don't knock over the Lachaise with your stroller.   The garden opens at 6 P.M. for the 8:30 P.M. concerts, on Friday and Saturday nights. Ms. Porter suggests arriving by 7 P.M. to get one of the 400 garden chairs (some people take their own seating). Sandwiches, juice, wine and beer are sold in the garden, and dinner is served in the museum's restaurant from 5 to 11:30 P.M. (The museum is also open on Fridays until 8:30 P.M. and Saturdays until 6 P.M.) This weekend, the program is music for piano; next weekend, the Mosaic String Quartet is to play. Keep in Mind    \\"REVEALING ROOTS: UNCOVERING INFLUENCES ON CONTEMPORARY AMERICAN PUPPET THEATER,\\" an exhibition of various styles of puppets, divided by culture and heritage, including African, Mexican, Japanese, Indonesian, American Northwest and European traditions. Through Sept. 30. Hours: Monday and Thursday, noon to 8 P.M. and Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday, noon to 6 P.M.

Making drinks with pure cocoa powder allows you to sweeten it as you please. Cocoa powder does not contain the laundry list of preservatives contained in the mixes. Cocoa powder has a bit of caffeine: A six-ounce cup of cocoa has 10 milligrams. By contrast, six ounces of brewed coffee contain 83 milligrams.

Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the military-backed Government nominated Marc L. Bazin as Haiti's new Prime Minister last week. The action was widely seen as a bid by the Haitian Army to find a formula short of restoring Mr. Aristide that will persuade the international community to lift a crushing economic embargo.   For years, Haitian intellectuals and political activists, particularly those on the left, have referred to United States policy as the \\"American Plan,\\" which they said was intended to prevent Haiti's development so as to preserve it as a cheap labor pool. To many of these Haitians, nobody was more associated with this supposed policy than the 60-year-old Mr. Bazin, a former World Bank official who is as fluent in conservative development theories as he is in accent-less English. If his long cozy relations with Washington were expected to obtain the United States' acquiescence in attempts to finally dispose of Father Aristide, however, initial signs suggest they have failed badly.

Mr. Davies, an English composer born in 1934; came to Princeton University in 1962 to continue his studies. Two years before this, he wrote &#8220;O Magnum Mysterium&#8221; for a December performance by youngsters with not too much time to rehearse. Thus the elements of the vocalinstrumental section of the score are simple, although they are assembled in a contemporary way that will startle many people. Two &#8220;sonatas&#8221; serve as interludes between pairs of carols, some of them variations of the opening &#8220;O Magnum Mysterium&#8221; for solo soprano. A little improvisation is permitted the players (largely percussion) in the second sonata. This carolsonata sequence occupies one side of the disk; on the other is an organ fantasia on &#8220;O Magnum Mysterium,&#8221; which the composer thinks of as a final complex meditation on the theme, just as the first part is an innocent, extrovert version. The organ fantasia is highly dissonant but carried out in slow motion, &#224; la Mcssiaen, and strikingly beautiful. The whole work is unusual and fascinating, thoroughly English in idea but contemporary in application. The performance sounds as one might expect definitive, since it is under the composer's direction. Certainly the opening solo by a boy soprano is wonderfully ethereal&#8212;R.E.

Neither choreographer settled for the kind of reaches and swoons that are characteristic of the ballet genre, delivering their messages of passion and regret with blessed crispness and invention. Both chose classical music of a sort Graham never worked with. Mr. Foreman's \\" . . . ing,\\" danced by the choreographer and Terese Capucilli, was set to a Brahms sonata. Mr. Rioult's \\"Narayama,\\" which he performed with Joyce Herring, was set to the adagio from a Mendelssohn concerto.

Every one of the seven dances presented on this program of choreography by young black women was built on an idea with a ring of passionate truth. The ideas were fully realized in well-crafted, smoothly staged dances of impressive variety. And the performers were uniformly vibrant.    The evening opened with \\"Jumpers in Command,\\" in which Stephon Webb introduced acrobatics to high-speed rope jumping by himself and by Onika Garcia, Latoya Harris and Tanya Miller. The dance proper began with Edisa Weeks's haunting \\"Koros,\\" a trio in which bare-breasted women wearing white tube gowns joined at the bottom, their skin powdered white and their hair covered, oozed and clung and pulled away from one another and out of their dresses to quietly percussive body sounds that built to an orgasmic pitch. \\"Koros\\" was performed by Wendy S.
