Once that bandit chief has been put out of harm's way, the question remains of what to do to stabilize the region.   Presumably, there will be a transition military government, similar to that in Germany and Japan after World War II, under the control of occupying powers. But this time the occupying will probably be in the name and under the control of the United Nations. Questions will arise from the beginning of how to compensate Iraq's victims and how to assure that its assets will not be diverted again to military adventures. Those purposes would be served by creation of an international authority under United Nations control to administer Iraq's oil assets.   The authority would operate the oil fields and associated refineries and other facilities in Iraq, the conditions and proceeds to be decided according to United Nations resolutions. First claim on the proceeds should be for the victims of the Iraqis in Kuwait, including its natives, foreign displaced persons and its government. Second priority should be to defray the costs sustained in the measures necessary to restore legality in the area. Third priority should be the needs of critically needy humanitarian relief, for children in third world countries, for example, to strengthen such activities supported by United Nations and Unesco funds.

Last week, the Justice Department sent out a 38-page legal opinion to Federal agencies with guidelines to see if their programs can pass the new test.

The policies have one main drawback -- high expenses.\\n\\nThe combination of sales commissions, insurance charges, administrative costs and money management fees can cut sharply into returns. Typically, \\"a projected return of 12 percent over a period of 20 years turns into 8 percent once the expenses are paid,\\" said James H. Hunt, an actuary and a director of the National Insurance Consumer Organization in Alexandria, Va.\\n\\n\\nLast month, the Security Benefit Life Insurance Company of Topeka, Kan., introduced a low-load, or low commission, version of variable life insurance. American Life Insurance of New York, has quietly begun offering a similar product. And Ameritas Life, of Lincoln, Neb., plans to bring out its own version early next year.\\n\\n\\"Anybody who is shopping for life insurance ought to consider one of these low-load variable life policies,\\" said Glenn Daily, author of \\"The Individual Investor's Guide to Low-Load Insurance Products.\\"\\n\\nThe low-load products, which are sold by phone instead of by insurance sales agents, have one distinct advantage. The sales commission on a traditional load product generally eats up most, if not all, of the first year's premium, leaving a cash balance near zero at the end of one year. But the cash value of a low-load product is about the same as the premium paid after one year.\\n\\nSecurity Benefit's product comes with eight investment fund choices, all managed by the company. American Life has 14 investment options, including funds managed by Scudder, Twentieth Century and Calvert. Its variable policy is available now in New York but will be sold in several states by the end of the month.\\n\\nAmeritas, also licensed in New York, plans to offer 11 mutual fund choices from two no-load fund groups, said Gay Yellen, vice president of Veritas, a Houston-based unit of the insurer. The performance of all the policies' underlying investments is very important, of course, since saving money on commission is futile if the policyholder fails to make money on the investment.\\n\\nSecurity Benefit, which is seeking New York approval for its product, sells its policy through fee-only planners, some of whom are represented by the Wholesale Insurance Network of Tampa, Fla. Consumers who call the network are referred to a financial consultant, who might charge $100 an hour for advice, said Keith Maurer, president of the network. Buying a variable policy \\"should cost $250, at most,\\" he said.\\n\\nMr. Maurer and his staff will also sell no-load policies for no fee to people who do not need advice on coverage or investments. The network receives a monthly fee from the 30 insurance companies it represents.\\n\\nJust because an insurance policy does not carry a sales commission, however, does not mean it is a good deal. Other charges include mortality expenses, or the cost to pay death benefits","excerpt":"administrative charges, and in the case of variable life, investment management fees.\\n\\nFor Security Benefit's product, these other expenses are quite high. The charge for mortality and expense risk is nine-tenths of one percent. \\"That is the maximum that companies can charge,\\" Mr. Daily said.\\n\\nStill, a full analysis of the Security Benefit product shows it is quite competitive with policies sold on commission, said Mr. Hunt, whose organization will analyze policies for consumers for a fee.\\n\\nHe examined a Security Benefit policy with a death benefit of $100,000 and an annual premium of $1,200, and another policy that had a $500,000 benefit and a premium of $12,000. Security Benefit applied all charges as a percentage of assets, no matter the policy size, Mr. Hunt said. Noting that most companies charge higher expenses for small policies, he said that Security Benefit offers the most attractive variable policy for $100,000 that he has seen.\\n\\nFor comparison, he pointed to a $100,000 variable life policy from Prudential that his 35-year-old daughter had considered. The policy was illustrated to show 12 percent annual returns. His analysis showed the annual return after expenses to be about 8 percent over 20 years.\\n\\nFor the Security Benefit policy, which was illustrated by the company to show a 9 percent return, the return after expenses was 6.6 percent over 20 years, he said. The difference, known as the spread, was just 2.4 percentage points on the Security Benefit policy, compared with 4 points on the Prudential policy. \\"I have not seen a policy with such a narrow spread,\\" Mr. Hunt said. \\"Clearly, the low load affords substantial savings for that policy.\\"\\n\\nSecurity Benefit's low-load policy is simply the first, and it is too soon to tell how it will stack up against products from American Life, Ameritas and other companies. Investors who buy a low-load policy, however, can rest assured that they can change course without paying a big penalty. \\"Since there is no front-end charge and no surrender charge, you can just buy it and drop it later if you decide it didn't perform well,\\" Mr. Daily said.\\nTaking Agents Out of the Game \\n\\n HAVING started with universal and whole life, several low-load insurance companies are branching out.\\n\\nTheir latest foray, into variable life insurance, is welcomed by many planners and insurance advisers. The reason: low-load policies have a low sales charge.\\n\\n\\"We've all been so anxious to have some low-load options in variable life because it's so expensive,\\" said James H. Hunt, a director of the National Insurance Consumer Organization in Alexandria, Va.\\n\\nThe remaining gaps in the low-load market will probably be filled in a couple of years, said Glenn Daily, a fee-only insurance adviser.\\n\\n\\"We need a low-load disability policy offered by one of the big players like Paul Revere or Unum and we need a few more variable life products,\\" Mr. Daily said. \\"But we're almost to the point that you don't ever need to deal with an agent again.\\" Your Own Account;\\nLife Insurance With Fewer Frills"},{"year":"1986","title":"Even though it has the reputation of being a well-managed company, Ted Bates Worldwide, on the verge of becoming part of publicly held Saatchi & Saatchi of London, has appointed its first chief administrative officer, John Hoyne.
