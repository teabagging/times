The Connecticut Storytelling Center, based at Connecticut College in New London and directed by Barbara Reed, has coordinated the state's participation in \\"Tellebration! A Night of Storytelling.\\" All programs will begin at 8 P.M. and feature multiple storytellers, some accompanied by live music.    The event marks the third year that the National Association for the Preservation and Perpetuation of Storytelling, headquartered in Jonesborough, Tenn., has sponsored these benefit performances to help pay for an archive of stories on tape, video and the printed page.    \\"Storytelling lost its appeal with the invention of printing,\\" said Peg O'Sullivan, one of the storytellers. \\"But people in recent years have indicated a wish to re-establish a connection with the past through this particular medium. Storytelling is not just for children.\\"    Admission is $5 at all the following locations: East Windsor, Wesley United Methodist Church","excerpt":"to obtain tickets, call 749-4223.

Willimantic, Eastern Connecticut State University, 455-0203. NOV. 23, 1963     Like many Americans, Harold Pantely, director of the Clockwork Repertory Theater in Oakville, says he has felt that the assassination of President John F. Kennedy was a watershed event in his life. \\"I think most of us can recall exactly where we were and what we were doing when it happened,\\" he said.   His preoccupation with the subject culminated in a decision to write a trilogy of plays that began with \\"Four Tragic Days in November,\\" which he produced in 1988, dealing with the assassination and the events immediately surrounding it.   A new play, called \\"A Lapse of Reason,\\" focuses on the trial of Jack Ruby, the man who killed Lee Harvey Oswald, Kennedy's assassin. It is being performed at 8 P.M. on Friday and Saturday and Nov. 23 and 24 at the theater, 133 Main Street in Oakville.   \\"In doing the research,\\" said Mr. Pantely, \\"I was struck by the relative unimportance of Ruby himself during the trial, compared with the prominence of the lawyers' theatrics and maneuverings, particularly Melvin Belli, the defense attorney. As a result, Ruby became more and more incoherent, talking at random to anyone who would listen.\\" Ruby's conviction and death sentence were overturned on a technicality by an appeals court in 1966, and he died of cancer in 1967.    A third play based on the Warren Commission report on the assassination and the theories that it generated in subsequent years is on the agenda for 1992.    Tickets are $8. Call 274-7247 for reservations. EAST INDIAN CINEMA     The Common Wealth of Letters at Yale, where the English-language literature, films, poetry and drama of the former British Commonwealth countries is studied and catalogued, will present a series of East Indian films directed by India's foremost women directors, all of whom achieved prominence in the 1980's.    \\"Memory Episodes\\" by Vijaya Mehta will be shown at 4:30 P.M. on Thursday in Room 102 of Linsley-Chittendon Hall, 63 High Street, New Haven. It concerns the changing relationship of a husband and wife when the man is converted to Christianity. Another of her films, \\"The Barrister,\\" deals with Brahmin discrimination and cruelty to widows in the 1920's. It is scheduled for 7 P.M. on Friday in the Yale Art Gallery lecture hall, 65 High Street.    \\"It Rested\\" by Soudhamini is a documentary about the tribal community of Tamil Nadu in the northern mountains, shown at 1:30 P.M. on Friday at the art gallery, followed at 2:30 P.M. by Aparna Sen's \\"Parama,\\" in which the life of a well-to-do Bengali housewife is disrupted by a love affair. Another of Ms. Sen's films, \\"Sati\\" will be shown at 7:10 P.M. on Thursday at the gallery. Admission is free. LEAVING THE TRAIL    Orienteering differs from merely taking a hike in the woods, and those who would like to try it may attend a session at 11 A.M. next Sunday at Brooksvale Park in Hamden.    Hikers tend to stick to the trails, but orienteers eschew paths and follow detailed topographical maps to reach their destinations. The Western Connecticut Orienteering Club, a member of the United States Orienteering Federation based in Atlanta, offers the outings, monitored by certified leaders.   In a beginners' briefing at 10:30 A.M., newcomers will learn how to read the symbols for swamps, rocks, walls, paths and lakes on the map. Compasses are not necessary, but participants are welcome to bring their own or rent one for 50 cents.   Each person will receive a numbered card to punch at several checkpoints along the way, finally turning in the card at the end of the trail. \\"If you don't come in within three hours and turn in your card, we look for your car,\\" said Karen Olah, leader of the Western Connecticut Orienteering Club. \\"And if it's still there, we go out after you.\\" Only one member was lost in the four years that the club has been in existence, and he simply roamed onto the road, found his car and drove off without letting anyone know.    Experienced orienteers may try one or more of five courses in the park. Families may strike out together, individuals may go alone, or groups may form spontaneously. The charge is $4, which includes one map. Additional maps cost $2.    The terrain is hilly, sometimes wet, and rainy weather is no deterrent. \\"We just get fewer people in the rain,\\" said Ms. Olah. Running or hiking shoes and jeans are worn by most people, and it is not necessary to reserve a place. The sessions last about two and a half hours, she said, and the number of people varies from 50 to 100.   To reach the Hamden site, take Route 25, Exit 61-62 north on Route 10 for four miles, turn left onto Brooksvale Avenue and proceed a half mile to the park. Watch for the orienteering signs and Ms. Olah. For more information call 367-9791.

By constructing 27 terminals, Israel hopes to ease the burden on Palestinians and soften international criticism. But some Palestinians say the changes are just another example of Israel's imposing solutions that suit itself, and that the barrier still fences them in.   A1    Israel said that if the militant faction Hamas took part in next month's elections for the Palestinian Parliament, Palestinians in East Jerusalem would not be allowed to cast ballots there. Jerusalem is one of the most explosive issues in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and status of the city has great symbolic importance. The Palestinian leadership said that it might postpone the voting.   A3    Hussein Cries Foul  After another day of testimony about torture, beatings and executions under his rule, Saddam Hussein sought to turn the tables on his prosecutors with an outburst in which he accused American military guards of beating and torturing him and his co-defendants. Mr. Hussein did not say why he waited through six days in court without mentioning such mistreatment before.   A14    Seventy percent of registered Iraqi voters participated in last week's election, the highest turnout in a vote since the fall of Saddam Hussein, according to the Iraqi electoral commission. Commission officials warned that figures could still change; they are looking into more than 1,200 complaints of possible fraud or irregularities.   A19    Afghan House Takes Shape  President Hamid Karzai's chief political rival, Yunus Qanooni, was elected chairman of the lower house of Afghanistan's new Parliament. Mr. Qanooni, who is a Tajik, a member of the country's second largest ethnic group, defeated Abdul Rasul Sayyaf, who is a Pashtun, a member of the largest ethnic group. The race split the lower house down the middle and revealed an ethnic divide that may plague future debates.   A19    Iran Talks for the New Year  Representatives of three European countries and Iran met in Vienna for the first time since negotiations over Iran's nuclear development program were suspended. The purpose of the meeting was to see if enough common ground existed for the stalled negotiations to resume next year. An agreement was reached to hold further talks in January.   A5    Russian Limits on Charities  Russia's lower house of Parliament amended legislation intended to increase government control over charities and other private organizations, but left provisions that critics said could pressure groups politically, even forcing them to close. The legislation advanced despite international pressure, including a resolution of the United States Congress and appeals from leading Bush administration officials.    A3    NATIONAL   A20-31    Senate Stops Drilling Plan;Patriot Act Extended  In a chaotic conclusion to the Congressional year, the Senate blocked an effort on Wednesday to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling and struck a last-minute accord to extend the law known as the USA Patriot Act for six months. With Vice President Dick Cheney casting the decisive vote, the Senate also approved a $40 billion budget-cutting plan. And the Senate sent to President Bush a second Pentagon policy measure with a ban on torturing detainees linked to terrorism.   A1    Court Halts Detainee Transfer  A panel of a federal appeals court refused to allow the transfer of Jose Padilla from military custody to civilian law enforcement authorities to face terrorism charges, saying the Justice Department's effort gave the appearance that the government was trying to prevent the Supreme Court from reviewing the case.

A judge raised the possibility of sending union leaders to jail and commuters grappled with life without buses or trains. Late last night, members of the union's executive board were told there would be an emergency meeting at 1 a.m., though later it was postponed indefinitely.  A1      The economic burden was felt citywide -- hundreds of thousands of children skipping school, commuters spending extra hours shuttling to work and back.

By following policies of lower taxes, and free and fair trade, America has led the world with 33 straight months of growth, and more than 8 million new jobs. Inflation has been held under 4 percent. And meanwhile, nations clinging to high taxes and protectionist policies have not only failed to match our performance, they've lost jobs and seen their investment flow to the United States.   Opportunity is our engine of progress.

In Patrice Leconte's RIDICULE (1996), it is the good fortune of Ponceludon (Charles Berling), a poor country lord on a mission, to be very good at battles of wits. His plan is to make himself a court favorite, so he can gain access to Louis XVI and persuade him to finance a drainage project back home (Ponceludon is a very unselfish lord. This is not for him, but for the health of the local peasants.) Life being what it is, Ponceludon also finds love (with a virginal young thing who goes diving in her spare time) and sex (with an outspoken, slightly older countess.

Two attractive, well-dressed young men strangle a friend at their lovely Manhattan apartment just for the thrill of it, hide his body in an unlocked antique chest in their living room and then invite the rest of their friends over for champagne and cake. Alfred Hitchcock's ROPE (1948) is best known for its camera-work gimmick: the illusion of one long, continuous shot. But it's pure heaven for those of us who like our films icy, arch and talky. Farley Granger and John Dall play the murderers. James Stewart is the much too smart friend who knows something is up - Friday at 8 p.m. and Saturday at 6 p.m. on Oxygen.     It's easy to see who the bad guy is in HUD (1963). The title character (Paul Newman) is handsome, arrogant, drives his Cadillac convertible too fast and brazenly sleeps with married women.

Everyone but Magali (Beatrice Romand), and widowed fortyish winemaker whose children have grown up. In AUTUMN TALE (1998), from the French New Wave master Eric Rohmer, action is taken. Magali's son's girlfriend tries to fix her up with an ex-professor (and ex-boyfriend) of hers. Magali's best friend takes out a personals ad on her behalf and checks out one candidate very closely, It all comes together, in typical Rohmer style, at someone else's wedding - Sunday at 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. on IFC.     The moral of THE TENDER TRAP (1955), directed by Charles Walters, is that the single life is empty and the only true happiness comes with marriage and children. Frank Sinatra is Charlie, a happy (he thinks) New York bachelor. Debbie Reynolds is the 22-year-old aspiring actress-singer-dancer who's far more ambitious about her future career as wife, mother of three and Scarsdale homeowner, and Charlie fits into her plans perfectly. Celeste Holm is one of Charlie's multiple girlfriends, who figures she can't be picky; after all, she's 33 and single in New York. But all hope is not lost.

The film, which has its television premiere Wednesday at 9 p.m. on USA, builds gently to its pivotal event, a televised fight in March 1962 at Madison Square Garden in which Mr. Griffith administered a beating to Benny (Kid) Paret that turned out to be fatal. But it is just as restrained in following the threads that extended from that grisly event, one that stunned the country and, more than a year before Lee Harvey Oswald was shot on camera, showed the frightening powers of live television. Perhaps that pacing reflects the film's long gestation period. ''I was always interested in this, way before I even knew how to make a film,'' said Mr. Klores (near right, with Mr. Berger), who remembers watching the fight on television as a 12-year-old. ''What stayed with me was more than what happened,'' he said. ''What effects did this have on Emile and the Paret family?'' His exploration of that led in surprising directions -- to a subtheme of homophobia","excerpt":"to people who had not been interviewed about the fight in four decades; to vignettes of regret and reconciliation.

A.In the Northern Hemisphere, the sun appears lower in the sky as it heads toward its winter solstice - the time when the sun is farthest south of the Equator, according to Sherwood Harrington, an astronomer with the Astronomical Society of the Pacific. Because the earth's axis is tilted about 21 degrees, the Northern Hemisphere is tilted away from the sun in winter. As a result, the sun appears lower in the sky, Mr. Harrington said. At the same time, the Southern Hemisphere is tilted toward the sun","excerpt":"to people who live there, the sun appears higher in the sky. Q.What is mitral valve prolapse, and what dangers does it pose? A.Mitral valve prolapse is a common heart condition in which the mitral valve, between the left atrium and the left ventricle, is deformed. Normally, the mitral valve prevents blood from flowing back from the ventricle to the atrium instead of on to the rest of the body. A deformed mitral valve has excessive motion and moves past the normal ''closed'' position, thus allowing backflow of blood. The condition affects about 15 percent of the population but is most common in women. For the most part, the condition is innocuous, according to Dr. Richard H. Kay of New York Medical College. But he said mitral valve prolapse had been associated with heart murmurs, palpitations, infections and other conditions.

Awareness of these legal obligations might make young males think twice before fathering illegitimate children. When accompanied by counseling that also stresses the positive aspects of marriage (much lower incidence of child poverty, image of stability, strength of the intact family unit), we would help young men form intact families, rather than poor mother-and-child units.   If we really want to act in the best interests of children, we need to focus on programs to restore the father as family breadwinner -- in the long run, the only solution to the problem of child poverty.

It's the fictional story of the real-life Carrie McGavock, who turned her Tennessee plantation house into a makeshift hospital for Confederate soldiers after the bloody Battle of Franklin in 1864, which left nearly 2,000 dead. McGavock had almost 1,500 of the bodies buried in her own private cemetery on the Carnton plantation, hence her nickname. In spite of some negative reviews, the book has been selling briskly, and Warner Books set its print run at 250,000. The novel is featured by the Military Book Club and the American Compass Book Club, a conservative mail-order outfit, and it has also received a lot of attention in the Southern press. The Tennessean speculated it might do for the Carnton plantation what ''Gone With the Wind'' did for Atlanta: increase tourism. ''The house itself was used as a makeshift hospital, and bloodstains are clearly visible on the floors upstairs,'' The Tennessean advised would-be visitors. ''There are those who think this residence is home to spirits, some more civil than others. The grounds are lovely and well worth a leisurely stroll.'' If you don't mind the ghosts.    FIRE AND HONEY: ''Wild Ducks Flying Backward,'' a collection of very short writings and a few previously unpublished poems by the ever-zany Tom Robbins, lands at No. 15 on the nonfiction list this week. Robbins, whose novels include ''Even Cowgirls Get the Blues'' and ''Half Asleep in Frog Pajamas,'' muses here on everything from the actress Debra Winger (''She's walked a tightrope between fire and honey, between sulfur and roses, between sarcasm and succor, between monolith and disco ball'') to the letter ''Z'': ''In contrast to that prim, trim, self-absorbed supermodel, 'I,' or to 'O,' the voluptuous, orgasmic, bighearted slut, were 'Z' a woman, she would be a femme fatale, the consonant we love to fear and fear to love.'' The book also includes a hilarious essay about the Czech translation of his 1984 novel, ''Jitterbug Perfume,'' which he had parts of translated back into English. (''The red beet is a melancholy vegetable, always prepared to suffer. And from such turnip you cannot get any blood.'') And while he's at it, Robbins also explains the meaning of life: ''Our purpose is to consciously, deliberately evolve toward a wiser, more liberated and luminous state of being","excerpt":"to return to Eden, make friends with the snake and set up our computers among the wild apple trees. . . . Or, barring that, to turn out a good thin-crust pizza and a strong glass of beer.''

Beloved father of Helaine Lerner and Joan Rechnitz. Adored grandfather of Emily and her husband John Paladino, Adam and Joshua Rechnitz. Great-grandfather of Max Paladino. Father-in-law of Sidney Lerner and Robert Rechnitz. Funeral service at Frank E. Campbell, 1076 Madison Ave at 81 St, Tuesday November 20th 11:30AM. Interment to follow at Mt. Carmel Cemetery.    HEILBRUNN-Robert H. The American Jewish Committee is devastated by the loss of our precious friend, trusted leader and extraordinarily generous benefactor, Robert H. Heilbrunn. Despite a boundless commitment to philanthropy in a lifetime that spanned more than nine decades, Bob left this world with a will to do even more to touch people's lives in meaningful ways. His integrity, intelligence, vision, compassion, humanity and humility made him a remarkable and wonderfully rare individual. Along with his beloved wife of 67 years, Harriet, both members of our Board of Governors, Bob spearheaded AJC's humanitarian assistance program in 1998 to support the agency's major relief efforts around the world and here at home. The Heilbrunns later endowed AJC's Robert and Harriet Heilbrunn Humanitarian Relief Fund to allow the organization to respond quickly and effectively to domestic and international emergencies. His love affair with the Jewish people and, indeed, with all people, inspired him to try and help us all live together in mutual respect and dignity. In 1997, AJC's Harriet and Robert Heilbrunn Institute for International Interreligious Understanding was established. Bob was gratified by the most recent project of that Institute, AJC's publication of ''The Children of Abraham,'' two historic volumes designed to help Jews and Muslims better understand each other's faiths. Bob was determined to make a difference in his life, and, along with his adored partner Harriet, he did. He was an inspiration to anyone who believes that one man can help shape the world and make it a more decent place for us all. His legacy of human kindness is his everlasting tribute. With Bob's passing, we have lost an irreplaceable member of AJC's family and we mourn along with our dear Harriet, who, through her own indomitable spirit, will surely carry on his devotion to tikkun olam-the repair of the world. To his children Helaine and Sidney Lerner and Joan and Robert Rechnitz, his grandchildren, great-grandson and the rest of the grieving family, we send our most heartfelt prayers and condolences during this difficult time. Harold Tanner, President David A. Harris, Exec. Director Jaime Kelstein, Asst. Exec. Dir.    HEILBRUNN-Robert.

Particularly so are the oysters of Belon.

It is also the home of salt-marsh sheep, and pigs raised and slaughtered on farms; the fresh pork-based rough pates rillettes are famous throughout France.
