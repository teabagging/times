Today Mr. Rubin found a way. He reached deep into two Government trust funds  -- far deeper and probably for far longer than any of his predecessors ever did  -- to create room under the nation's $4.9 billion debt ceiling for more borrowing. To do so, he drew on a law written by the Reagan Administration, which in 1986 was trying to make sure that Democrats then in control of Congress did not do to the White House what Republicans have been trying to do to Mr. Clinton. Mr. Rubin chose that route to avoid a political land mine: the 1986 law guarantees that Congress will restore any interest lost in the financial manipulations.

The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed at 584.41, down 1.46 points, and the Nasdaq composite index closed at 1,043.54, down 3.51 points. For the week, the Dow rose 24.93.   The blue-chip indicator gained 0.52 percent for the week and 5.2 percent for the third quarter, compared with gains of 9.4 percent in the year's second quarter and 8.5 percent in the first quarter.  [ Page 37. ] Yields of Treasury securities hit a two-week low, with the 30-year bond falling to 6.50 percent, on weak economic data, raising expectations that the Fed may still reduce interest rates this year.  [ 36. ] The dollar was higher against most leading currencies as traders sold the German mark and Swiss franc to book profits after a Swiss official called the franc overvalued. In late New York trading, the dollar was at 1.4270 German marks, up from 1.4200; at 1.1560 Swiss francs, up from 1.1465, and at 99.70 Japanese yen, up from 99.22.  [ 32. ] G.D.P. Up a Revised 1.3%  Gross domestic product grew at a revised 1.3 percent in the second quarter, up from the previous estimate of 1.1 percent, bolstering the picture of a safe and steady expansion. Although the quarter was the weakest in more than two years, it kept alive an expansion that is four and a half years old.  [ 34. ] Kerkorian Adds to His Team  Kirk Kerkorian has hired Ralph Whitworth, a Washington-based shareholder activist, to the team he is assembling to take on Chrysler. The hiring is further evidence that Mr. Kerkorian is planning a drawn-out campaign to change the way Chrysler is run.  [ 35. ] Fed Rate Decision Was Unanimous  The Federal Open Market Committee voted 11-0 to hold the Federal funds rate for overnight bank loans at 5.75 percent at its Aug. 22 meeting, minutes showed. The committee last lowered rates at its July 6 session.  [ 34. ] Change at Perot Systems  Industry sources said that James A. Cannavino, who was I.B.M.'s chief strategist, would become president and chief operating officer of Perot Systems on Monday.  [ 35. ] Financier Accused of Stock Fraud  A New Jersey appeals court has unsealed stock-fraud charges against the censured financier Robert E. Brennan, accusing him and others of manipulating penny stocks from 1991 through December 1994.  [ 35. ] Magazine Closer to Running Article  Business Week magazine appeared a step closer to publishing an article based on sealed court documents in a lawsuit between Procter & Gamble and Banker's Trust when a Federal judge indicated that he would allow Procter & Gamble to amend its suit in a way that would in effect open the documents.  [ 6. ] Report Lifts Wheat Prices  December wheat jumped 8 cents, to $4.9225 a bushel, fueled by the quickening pace of wheat exports and low supplies. A report showed that leftover wheat supplies were below traders' expectations and that exports were nearly 9 percent ahead of last year's pace.  [ 32. ] Near-record wheat prices and a sharp increase for lettuce raised the index of prices farmers received for their raw products by 2.9 percent from August to September.  [ 34. ] For-Sale Signs Over Britain  Britain seems caught up in a free-market frenzy, with everything from banks, to public buildings, to a slice of British Rail all up for sale. The rush to the auction block began in the 1980's, when state-owned enterprises like airlines and telephone systems were for sale. Now, services once performed by the Government are being farmed out to private entrepreneurs.  [ 2. ] Wall Street Raises Funds for Casino  The Mohegans, a Connecticut Indian tribe, announced that Bear, Stearns and Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette had helped them raise funds to open a casino 10 miles from the successful Foxwoods Resort Casino in eastern Connecticut. The tribe expects to open a 150,000-square-foot casino with 3,000 slot machines and 180 table games.

Five years later, the company moved to San Francisco, where it established a theater and is an important dance producer. O.D.C. has also put together an impressive roster of artists, writers and composers with whom its three resident choreographers collaborate in dances for the troupe itself and for other major dance companies. Given all this, one might expect a certain stodginess or disdain for risk. But on the evidence of the opening night program, O.D.C. is more alive and is kicking harder than in its early Oberlin days.    The company's 10 dancers have a bracing way of moving, as if the terrain before them were to be shot through in brisk turns and soft looping tabs and high, stretched jumps. Dynamos, they stop and start on a dime but do so with considerable eloquence. \\"Force of Circumstance,\\" a dance by the company's founder, Brenda Way, that is set to a vigorous modular score by Paul Dresher, is a pure-movement dance in which lines and wedges of dancers plow the stage space in carefully constructed choreography. But the overall effect is of tremendous life struggle. Careful scrutiny of any single dancer's role reveals small, quick gestures and odd lifts and falls that are freighted with unspecified emotions. \\"Force of Circumstance\\" was performed by Shannon Mitchell, Mae Chesney, Lizanne McAdams, Ney Fonseca, Robert Moses and Richard Chen See. David K. H. Elliott created the strong lighting here and throughout the program.    Ms. Way is a choreographer of almost willful nerve, intelligence and curiosity. For \\"Loose the Thread,\\" set to an evocative score by Mr. Dresher, she has chosen the life of Virginia Woolf and the Bloomsbury group as her subject. George Herriman's comic strip, \\"Krazy Kat,\\" is the subtext for \\"Still Krazy/Kat,\\" danced to music by Jelly Roll Morton, Charles L. Roberts and William Bolcom, with taped cartoon voices by Geoff Hoyle.    It is a measure of Ms. Way's success that one is left wanting more in each case, but the hunger is principally for a sharper focus. The choreographer creates an intensity of atmosphere and a feeling of layered imagery in the first piece that are reminiscent of Woolf's writing. Ms. Way suggests the fastidiousness of Bloomsbury passions, and the condescension. Her final image strikingly captures Woolf's struggle to maintain her psychic equilibrium. But surely the group must have been preoccupied by more than the constant changing of sexual partners, real and fantasized?    \\"Loose the Thread\\" was danced by Ms. Mitchell as Woolf, Patricia Jiron as Vita Sackville-West, Ms. Mc Adams as Woolf's sister, Vanessa, and Mr. See, Brian Fisher, Ms. Chesney, Mr. Fonseca, K. T. Nelson, Mr. Moses and Kevin Ware. The handsome costumes were by John and Sandra Woodall, with scenic design by Mr. Woodall. Leslie Scalapino served as literary collaborator.    A full appreciation of the ambitious, sprawling \\"Still Krazy/Kat\\" probably depends on knowing the Herriman characters well (or not at all). The piece is otherwise fun but somewhat confusing, for all the splendor of the sets by Wayne Thiebaud, the costumes by Eleanor Coppola and the cartoonlike, nervy angularity and tumbling pace of the choreography. Ms. Nelson, Mr. See and Mr. Moses led the cast as the wide-eyed and lovable Krazy, the belligerent Ignatz Mouse and the scheming Offissa Pup, respectively. Ms. Nelson, a boldly compelling actress, is the creator of \\"The Velveteen Rabbit,\\" which will be performed next week at the Joyce, 175 Eighth Avenue at 19th Street.

Wendell Belew Jr. was chief counsel for the House Budget Committee from 1977 until Congress adjourned in late December, and as such was a key behind-the-scenes staff member in the establishment of the Congressional budget process in the 1970's and the writing late last year of a budget-balancing law sponsored in the Senate by Phil Gramm of Texas and Warren B. Rudman of New Hampshire.   Mr. Belew is opening a consulting concern here and will begin writing a newsletter on the budget. He took time out the other day to reflect on his years with the House Budget Committee and to discuss the budget process as it has evolved. Q. Has the budget process failed?  A. All the institutions that have had to deal with the budget and economic policy have failed to a certain extent, and I wouldn't exempt the Congressional budget process from that description. There have been a lot of successes in the budget process. The average member of Congress is much more sophisticated in understanding economic policy and understanding the structure of the Federal budget. But one cannot escape the fact that budget deficits are in the $200-to-$300-billion range and are not likely to be reduced from that level. Q. Why has there been this failure?  A. One problem with the budget process is that it is very, very difficult to predict with any certainty what the outcomes of policy are going to be and what the outcomes of matters beyond the control of policy, such as the economy, interest rates and unemployment, are going to be.
