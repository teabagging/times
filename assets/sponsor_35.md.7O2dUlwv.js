Such is the crush in an active pit, that floor traders cannot see or hear each other within the small trading arena, and often must deal with those who are closest to them physically.    This factor, combined with the proliferation of new futures and options, has contributed to the shrinkage of brokerage profits, the sharp rise in costly order execution errors and, in an alarming number of cases, the inability to execute orders at specified prices during periods of price volatility, the very time when traders are most eager to do business.

But modernism has another, quieter tradition, a shadow theme that in recent years has risen to the fore. It is the seduction of the compact and the compressed, of imagist poetry and Surrealist art, of small incendiary objects like Meret Oppenheim's fur-lined teacup, with its power to send shivers down the museumgoer's spine.\\n\\nFor the first half of the 20th century, art sought to match the grand scale of 19th-century technology. Only when engineering lowered the ante to the size of the electron did design follow. Small became modern when it became powerful. Today the words \\"micro\\" and \\"mini\\" send the same signal that \\"sleek\\" and \\"streamlined\\" did in the 1930's: They extol the power of the most exciting technologies of the era. The 30's Buck Rogers vision of spaceships and ray guns was later echoed in the 60's James Bond world of gizmos in your pockets -- gizmos that technology has now transported from the movies to the mall. Pocket power is the macho of miniaturization: Is that a cellular phone in your pocket, Mae West might ask today, or are you just happy to see me? \\n\\nIncreasingly, industrial designers concentrate on objects small enough to hold in the hand: the computer mouse and remote controls that give us power over technologies that are essentially shapeless and abstract, locked invisibly into chips and boxes. Sony's television remote control is about the size of a credit card; Go Video's remote is a kind of electronic pebble. The new mini-disk players from Sony, RCA, Aiwa and other manufacturers are a third the size of the CD players they supplant. \\n\\nMaking things smaller changes their esthetics. In dreaming up the Dynabook, the 60's forerunner of laptops, the computer visionary Alan Kay was inspired by the 16th-century Venetian printer Aldus Manutius, who revolutionized book publishing with a small but readable italic type that made it possible to print pocket editions of the classics. Being able to put a book in your saddlebag, instead of chaining it to a library table, transformed book design as well as reading habits. \\n\\nModern miniaturization taps other esthetic traditions as well. The Dutch history of close observation -- Vermeer's interiors and van Leeuwenhoek's microscope -- is reflected in the Netherlands-based Philips Company's invention of the audio cassette and the compact disk. The Japanese reverence for the small -- especially the Buddhist notion of shibui, a spirituality of minimalism -- prepared the culture for the electronics age. \\"Anything small is beautiful,\\" proclaims a Japanese proverb.\\n\\nThe Olympus XA 1 camera of the early 80's, designed by Yoshihisa Maitani, took inspiration from the traditional Japanese package, an egg wrapped in straw: fragile contents in a durable exterior. The XA 1 became the prototype for electronic point-and-shoot cameras. Its successor, the Olympus Stylus, shimmering in black chrome, is shaped to fit the hand. Its minimalist companion is the Olympus L400 microcassette recorder, about the size of a vintage Zippo lighter. These are precious objects, as charged visually as electrically.\\n\\nIt was Sony's Walkman that showed that small electronics had become accessories, like jewelry. Sony called the Walkman \\"a life style product\\" and proceeded to develop hundreds of variants, in a plenitude of styles not seen since the American automobile industry at its height, in the 50's, set out to provide a model for everyone. \\n\\nThe American tradition of the miniature was also tied to another spiritual force: mobility. In a big country with people constantly on the move, the portable gadget became a valuable commodity. The smaller things were, the more of them you could carry with you. By the late 40's, manufacturers were producing small tube radios, but consumers perceived them as tinny and cheap. Only when the transistor arrived in the mid-50's, combining better sound with the mystique of \\"space-age innovation,\\" did little radios begin to appear in American pockets.\\n\\n\\"Fits in a pocket\\" has been the ringing claim made for all sorts of powerful devices. When Edwin Land began planning the Polaroid SX-70, he handed his engineers a piece of wood representing the ideal size of the device. It should fit into a coat pocket, he said. \\n\\nBut \\"pocket-sized\\" is often more promise than reality. In 1957, Sony established its beachhead in the American market by touting its transistor radio as the first \\"shirt-pocket\\" model. When its efforts to miniaturize the radio fell just a bit short -- or a bit large -- Sony's co-founder, Akio Morita, made his first concession to American-style marketing: He ordered shirts for his salesmen with pockets slightly larger than standard.\\n\\nOn April 14, 1971, the first pocket calculator, the Texas Instruments Pocketronic, came on the market. Despite the name, few pockets were strong enough to hold the two-and-a-half-pound, $250 device, and fewer still were deep enough to afford it. But the Pocketronic quickly became a status symbol, and within a year five million had been sold.\\n\\nApple boasts that its Newton Messagepad hand-held computer fits a jacket pocket. But once there, it bulges like a .38-caliber snubnose. And while Apple's ads show the Newton stuck in the seat pocket of a pair of jeans, the manual warns of the dangers of sitting on the device.\\n\\nThe telephone is the latest electronic gizmo to shrink. Makers of portable phones try to claim the smallest, as automakers once claimed the most powerful engine. To fit in a pocket, these phones fold clamshell-like. Closing them has become a power gesture. Decisively telescoping down the antenna, the user recalls the U-boat captain who has sighted on his target: \\"Down periscope. Prepare to fire torpedoes!\\" Snapping shut the phone says firmly: Deal done, case closed.\\n\\nThe designers of the first laptop computer, the Grid Compass, aimed for a similarly aggressive image. As Stephen Hobson, one of the designers, explained: \\"When you close the machine, you want it to have the same precise, sensual quality to the fit that you get when you slam home the chamber of a gun.\\"\\n\\nIn the computer culture, size and power are inversely related. The businessman with his Powerbook laptop is one-upped by his airline seatmate with a notebook, in turn disdained by the passenger across the aisle with a subnotebook. Compaq boasts that its Contura Aero Subnotebook \\"weighs less than a two-liter bottle of Coke and takes up less surface than a sheet of notebook paper.\\"\\n\\nThe champions of the tiny sometimes outwit themselves, however. Carried too far, small becomes silly. The smallest computers have keyboards that appear to be scaled for an infant's digits.\\n\\nBut just when it seems that miniaturization has reduced things to absurdity, engineers are dreaming of even tinier technology. \\"Mini\\" and \\"micro\\" are being succeeded by \\"nano,\\" to indicate a billionth of a meter. Prophets of nanotechnology envision a world of devices that make electronic chips seem gigantic. The virtuoso achievements of nanotech are today's equivalent of laying a railroad across Siberia or damming the Colorado. Nano-engineers have created gears the size of an aphid, tweezers that can grasp a paramecium and electric motors the size of a hair. I.B.M. scientists a few years ago succeeded in reproducing their company logo in individual molecules. And in Japan, engineers created a moving model car no bigger than a grain of rice.\\n\\nLe Corbusier's dream of rebuilding Paris and Joyce's of reconstituting language are exceeded by the ambitions of nanotechnology: to create vehicles to travel the blood stream and molecule-sized factories to practice modern-day alchemy. The nano-dreamers aim at nothing less than rebuilding a world within the world -- modernist ambition at its most hubristic.\\nA Few of the Latest Micro-Gizmos\\n(Prices given are list, but most are discounted.)\\nMini-disk player\\n* Aiwa AMD-50, $600\\n* RCA RP-6001, $499\\nMicrocassette recorder\\n* Sony M-909 Pressman, $319.95\\n* Olympus L400, $309\\nMini-camera\\n* Olympus Stylus Limited Edition, $399.95\\n* Kodak Cameo Zoom Plus, $199.95\\nCellular phone\\n* Motorola Microtac Ultra Lite, $700\\n* Fujitsu PCX, $895\\nPocket television\\n* Sharp 4M-T30U Liquid Crystal Display\\ncolor TV, $599\\n* Sony FD-285 2.7-inch Watchman black-\\nand-white TV with AM/FM radio, $179.99\\nRemote control\\n* GO Video Palm-mate Universal remote (for TV's, VCR's and cable boxes), $49.95\\n* Sony STR-G1ES audio-video receiver with\\nwireless mouse, $1,700\\nSub-notebook computer\\n* Compaq Contura Aero, $1,399\\n* Hewlett-Packard Omnibook 430\\nSuper portable PC, $1,399\\nComputer mouse\\n* Logitech Mouseman Cordless, $109\\n* Logitech Trackman stationary mouse, $139\\nHand-held computer\\n* Apple Newton Messagepad 110 computer , $599\\nP.P.

But the price to be paid could be much higher than the cost of some cold-rolled steel. The whole idea has infuriated the United Steelworkers union, which recently agreed to wage cuts that management said were necessary to save jobs -jobs that union officials feared they would lose to cheaper imports. Now the workers have lost both money and faith in management.\\n\\nBritish Steel's boss is losing his job, but he has another lined up. Ian MacGregor, the former head of AMAX -who is known in Parliament as the Butcher of Britain - is moving on to the country's National Coal Board with instructions to return the Government-owned company to profitability. The Scots-born American citizen tried to do just that at British Steel by slashing employment and output. But the recession-wracked steelmaker is losing as much money now as it was when he took over three years ago.

Instead of being held in August, the sale will now take place July 29-30 at the New York Sheraton Hotel.\\n\\nThese moves were approved in a recent unanimous vote by the four participating firms - Stack's of New York, Paramount International of Miami, Rarcoa of Chicago and Superior of Beverly Hills, Calif. They were prompted by several considerations, according to Edward D.  Milas, president of Rarcoa, who coordinates logistics for the partners' yearly sales.

Cuomo is making it increasingly clear that he really is considering the 1992 Presidential race and that his primary obstacle is the political burden of serving as Governor while running for President.   In the 10 days since Mr. Cuomo rejuvenated the dormant speculation about his future by saying he was thinking about the race, he has held a running dialogue with reporters and supporters about the three options he faces: not to run, to run while Governor, or to resign and run.   \\"The fundamental problem is what do you do about being governor,\\" said one longtime adviser to Mr. Cuomo. \\"His mind tells him he can't do both, but his heart is saying there must be a way.\\"   Many of Mr. Cuomo's closest advisers consider the resign-and-run option a long shot. If Mr. Cuomo stepped down and left his office to Lieut. Gov. Stan Lundine, he would likely face harsh criticism for abandoning his obligation to the state. He also would give up a job he relishes and his only residence, the Executive Mansion.   But after watching the incremental progress of Mr. Cuomo's musings over the last week, many of the Governor's aides and advisers, as well as Democratic leaders from around the country, say they believe he is now engaged in a serious examination of the other two options.   Mr. Cuomo's supporters in New York and elsewhere said today it has long seemed clear that he would relish a race against President Bush. The clearest sign yet that he was actively considering the race came Sunday night in Chicago, where Mr. Cuomo told reporters that he believed that he had \\"until sometime in November\\" to make a decision. A Question of Priorities    Throughout the seven years that Mr. Cuomo has flirted with the Presidency, he has described his decision-making process in linear terms. First, he has said, he would have to decide that he was more capable than other contenders. Then, he would have to decide that he could do the job. And finally, he would have to figure out what to do about his responsibilities as Governor.   Many of the Democratic Governor's closest advisers, most of whom admit that they want Mr. Cuomo to run, say they believe that he has vaulted the first two hurdles and is now measuring the final barrier.   \\"The bottom-line problem is I'm the Governor of the state of New York,\\" he said in Chicago. \\"How do you manage that and do a Presidential campaign?\\"   Why is the Governor holding this public dialogue? The possibility cannot be dismissed, gubernatorial aides say, that part of the Governor's motive may be to let supporters down softly if he chooses not to run. But most believe something more serious is going on, even if he ultimately decides not to run. It is also difficult to know whether a Cuomo candidacy would be significantly damaged if Mr. Cuomo, after suggesting that the state would suffer under an absentee governor, became one anyway.   Also weighing on Mr. Cuomo is the experience of the last Democratic nominee, Michael S. Dukakis, who mixed Presidential and gubernatorial politics into a lethal combination. Having run on the platform of the Massachusetts Miracle, Mr. Dukakis was held directly accountable as a sitting governor when the miracle unraveled in mid-campaign.   By the time he returned to the Statehouse in Boston, Mr. Dukakis was the object of such scorn -- in part because he had not tended to problems at home and in part because he had lost -- that his final two years in office became an endurance test in humiliation.   Mr. Dukakis's experience may have left an indelible impression on the electorate. A New York Times/CBS News poll conducted Oct. 10-15 shows that 53 percent of the 991 registered voters questioned said a sitting governor could not fulfill his responsibilities at home while running for President. Problems at Home    Clearly, there are differences between Mr. Dukakis's situation and that of Mr. Cuomo. Because the political timetable for 1992 has been contracted, Mr. Cuomo would be running for President for a maximum of only one year. The Dukakis campaign lasted almost twice that long.   But Mr. Cuomo also faces obstacles at home that Mr. Dukakis did not face, at least at the beginning of his campaign. Unlike Massachusetts, where both houses of the Legislature were Democratic and could protect Mr. Dukakis from state problems, New York has a divided Legislature with a Republican State Senate. New York also has a looming budget problem that the Republicans could make embarrassing for Mr. Cuomo throughout the primary season.   \\"Let's say I wanted to run, that I passed all the other impediments,\\" he said at a news conference Friday. \\"What would you do about being Governor? Quit? Say, 'Oops, sorry, there's a more important task,' or try to do it with one hand? That's the problem that is very, very difficult to get past.\\"   Mr. Cuomo has been so effective in making the case against running that many of his advisers believe he will not do so. That, of course, raises the question of why Mr. Cuomo has made his thought process so public.   If, as in 1987, the Governor declines to run after a long and public flirtation, he inevitably will be criticized for both a lack of backbone and for suspending the Democratic contest with his hand-wringing.   The most generous interpretation of why Mr. Cuomo has chosen this course of public discussion comes from John A. Marino, the state Democratic chairman and a close Cuomo adviser. \\"There is something here that people fail to see, which is that he is intensely honest and shares his thoughts,\\" Mr. Marino said.   But others in Albany think it was not coincidental that Mr. Cuomo began his public ruminations shortly after expressing frustration that the media was paying less attention to his comments on national affairs.   \\"It's the Jesse syndrome,\\" said one state official, referring to the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson. \\"The minute you say you're not running, people start ignoring you.\\"   Political Memo","excerpt":"Biggest Hurdle for Cuomo As He Ponders '92: His Job"},{"year":"2001","title":"Travel article on go-slow approach that AMR Corp is taking in merging Trans World Airlines with American Airlines in effort to avoid disruption and delays","excerpt":"biggest hurdle may be in early December, when American plans to move TWA to Sabre computer reservation system and combine schedules; photo (M) T.W.A.
