The bill also empowers the commission to require bus companies and street railroads to make an agreement as to the division of the fares.The Governor said that he was glad to approve both measures because they carried out recommendations in his message. He signed thirty-one other bills during the day and vetoed five.Four bills amending the liquor law were approved. One by Assemblyman Hollowell, Yates Republican, extends the prohibitions relating to the hours of sale of liquors and wines on premises licensed to sell at retail for on-premises consumption to include beer.New Liquor Bottling PermitThe three other measures were sponsored by Senator Ryan, Dutchess Republican. One authorizes the State Liquor Authority to issue a bottling permit to a wholesale wine or liquor licensee to recask or clarify wine or liquor imported in bulk from a foreign country at a fee of $250.Another authorizes the Liquor Authority to issue a wine reconditioning permit to a wholesale wine licensee for reconditioning wines manufactured outside the State and purchased in sealed containers not exceeding fifteen gallons in content.The third Ryan bill provides that persons authorized to sell wine at retail for off-premises consumption may sell on credit to any church, synagogue or religious organization for sacramental purposes only.The Governor signed the Desmond bill doubling the license fees for private trade schools, and empowers the State Education Commissioner, instead of the Board of Regents, to suspend or revoke licenses. The bill also authorizes the Education Commissioner to require such schools to post a bond for the performance of contracts with students, and provides that no school shall be conducted in a factory or commercial establishment. The measure carries an appropriation of $5,000 for enforcement of the new law.Period Set for Hangar UseOther bills approved included:Fixing at twenty years the period of probable usefulness of the construction of airport hangars if the cost is in excess of $1,000,000.Providing that the requirements for an operator's license or a learner's permit shall not apply to the operation of a motor vehicle by a person 18 years of age under the supervision of an instructor in a high school or junior high school having a course in driving approved by the State Motor Vehicle Commissioner.Extending to Jan. 1, 1942, the time within which a member of the State Retirement System who is a member of an organized police force may elect to become a member of a city retirement system and contribute on the basis of retirement after twenty-five years' service.Providing that applicants for medical licenses who meet requirements as to preliminary and professional education, and who have evidence satisfactory to the Education Commissioner that they have been licensed in another State or territory of the United States, may receive a license to practice in this State without further examination.Providing for the creation of a credit union insurance fund by fifty or more credit unions.Requiring that a person making an income tax return shall take an oath specifically to his name and residence address.The Governor vetoed the Williamson bill which would have permitted the Masonic Guild of Portchester to contribute funds for maintaining the Masonic Home at Utica.He approved four bills to speed the construction of a new bridge at Niagara Falls to replace the famous \\"Honeymoon\\" bridge wrecked by an ice jam in the Niagara River several years ago.

In this World War I Army story that takes the reader into the trenches, the author lined up Company K's 113 officers and men and gave to each, round-robin fashion, a bit of his novel to tell. When ''Company K'' came out 51 years ago, Harold Strauss said in The Book Review that March had gone ''far beyond the confines of a novel","excerpt":"at a single stroke he invented and perfected a new form. No man could write the gigantic story that lies behind 'Company K,' but William March, by a brilliant refinement of form, has given us its essence and its broad sweep, flashes of its intensity and rich variety.''

The third of Mr. Roth's novels starring the novelist Nathan Zuckerman - following ''The Ghost Writer'' and ''Zuckerman Unbound'' - was published in hard covers last year. Zuckerman by now is middle-aged, devoid of ideas, emotionally exhausted and in constant pain. Robert Kiely, our reviewer, said: ''Roth has written, not a contemporary defense of fiction or poetry, but of the writer as bankrupt.

While most of New York's film revival houses have gone out of business, killed off by home video, real estate prices and competition from the multiplexes, Silent Movie does a brisk trade by wrapping early Hollywood in camp glamour and offering it to a city where the horizon of memory normally extends only as far as last month's box-office hit.\\n\\nThree nights a week, behind a humble facade on North Fairfax Avenue, not too far from Hollywood, a sort of rhinestone ritual unfolds.

Diamonds and arthritis and youth and inexperience conjoin, and a razor clam is brought to the surface, wiggling and defeated.\\n\\nWe dig until the bucket is filled and the sky has changed from black to purple to amethyst, set aglow by the first faceting rays of the sun. Then we retrace our path. The hard sand softens, turns to asphalt, grass, wood and finally linoleum: we are back in the kitchen, where a johnnycake, whipped up before we left, is cooled and waiting, one of a half-dozen dishes evolving on counter tops and in mixing bowls and baking pans. As soon as she sheds her Windbreaker, my early morning companion tumbles the clams into the sink, cleans and batters and breads them, then lays them into a pair of buttered frying pans. The commotion -- she is no reticent chef -- rouses a houseful of guests, who soon gather around a table widened with so many leaves that it drops off at each end like a giant toadstool. Coffee perfumes the room, clarifies sleep-fogged eyes, readies palates for this queer repast: corn bread and fried razor clams and tomato juice at 7 o'clock on a Sunday morning.

But the Jackson campaign never was conventional, not in style or purpose or measures of success. And the differences are traceable ultimately to the peculiar character of the candidate. The strength of this book is that Mr. Faw and Ms. Skelton appreciated this central fact.

Furthermore, he was challenging tradition and the pitfalls of uncertain artistry when he chose to do it with animated puppets of a sort never used before‚Äîlittle plastic-skinned, trimly costumed figures, operated by electricity. He calls these little figures \\"kinemins,\\" and they constitute his \\"cast.\\"But his daring has admirably paid off in the film, which opened yesterday afternoon at the Broadway Theatre for what should deservedly be an extended run. For the work is a charming entertainment in both the musical and the novelty line.As a novelty, first, the puppet method of telling the famous fairy tale of the two little children of the poor broommaker who get lost on a trip into the woods and run afoul of an old witch is both deft and appropriate. Mr. Myerberg's little figures, designed by James Summers and worked by a retinue of technicians, are amusing and flexible dolls which have surprisingly vivid and real personalities.It would be utterly wrong to term them \\"lifelike.\\" That is precisely what they are not. They are \\"doll-like,\\" and their charm and seduction are in the shaping through them of a doll-world. With very good color photography and against cunning cut-out sets, this picture has the quality of a truly visualized fairy tale. The very aspect of delicate fabrication complements the creation of make-believe.In the simplicity of the performance and the presentation of the music, too, Mr. Myerberg's ambitious production merits appreciative praise. While there may be an unpleasant twanginess in Hansel's synchronized voice, which is done by Constance Brigham, who does Gretel's pleasing voice, too, there is general attractiveness and richness in the speaking and singing voices. And the music, under Franz Allers' direction, has real operatic class.Anna Russell's synchronization of the cackling contralto of the witch is both humorous and melodious, tricked-up but adequately restrained. And Frank Rogier makes the voice of the father a full and affecting baritone. Delbert Anderson's singing for the sandman, who is a darling little night-shirted doll, is most agreeably soothing, and the Apollo Boys Choir sings the famous lullaby \\"Angels overhead will keep watch around you while you sleep\\"‚Äîfor a lovely climax to the nighttime scene.We would also like to mention that the witch's candy-house, which lives in the mind of this reviewer as one of his most dazzling childhood images, is represented in this picture in all of its recollected lusciousness.\\"Hansel and Gretel\\" is a fine film for children, but it should delight fanciful grown-ups, too.

Whatever this may say about the tastes of art lovers basking too long in the Mediterranean sunshine, it's a clear indication of Hollywood's overpowering influence on the international film world.

Big-name studio films and frenzied behind-the-scenes deal making, usually major aspects of the Cannes experience, have been low-key. Instead, something different has happened: Cannes looks more and more valuable as a launching pad for hand-picked specialty items, particularly when those films have international appeal. Interesting, offbeat film makers are the great beneficiaries when Hollywood stays home.   This year's perfect example is Nanni Moretti, a film maker whose popularity in Italy and France has suddenly exploded into worldwide attention. Mr. Moretti's work has had exposure on the film festival circuit (including a recent retrospective in Toronto). But there are many countries, including the United States, in which he is largely unknown.

Sure enough, there  she was looking famous on television several days later, as a few dozen people eagerly watched her on one monitor at the Palais des Festivals, action central for the Cannes International Film Festival. The crowd was hypnotized, but nobody had the faintest idea who this woman was. The answer, supplied succinctly by a newspaper the next day: \\"Czech model.\\"         This is business as usual on the glittery side of Cannes, the aspect of the event that has become second only to the Olympics in press coverage and desperate hype. Put enough star-crazy onlookers in one small place and you will  have mass hysteria if, say, Hugh Grant and Elizabeth Hurley arrive to screen a short trailer for their new film (a thriller that is not in the film festival and will not open until fall). At the cocktail party thrown for this preview, a  man introduced himself and suggested that Mr. Grant visit Turkey. Several others eavesdropped. Mr. Grant made a nice, noncommittal reply.

Mr. Robbins would stand out here even if he were nothing more than a strong contender for the best-actor award, which he is for his performance as the smooth-talking Hollywood executive Griffin Mill in \\"The Player.\\" But today he emerged as a directorial talent as well. \\"Bob Roberts,\\" the political satire that he wrote, directed and stars in, is the first new title here to touch off that current of surprise, chatter and excitement known on film-festival circuits as the buzz.   Mr. Robbins's fiendishly funny film, which is included in the Directors' Fortnight section of the festival, is obviously an idea whose time has come. Constructed as a mock documentary, it is a \\"This Is Spinal Tap\\" for the political arena, with flashes of Robert Altman's television series \\"Tanner '88\\" thrown in for good measure. Not for nothing has Mr. Altman been touting Mr. Robbins as a new director to be reckoned with, a recommendation that counts for a lot more than the standard hyperbole that is heard in this hype-crazy setting. It became clear at this morning's screening that Mr. Robbins, in simultaneously embodying the slick soullessness of both Hollywood and electoral politics, is truly the man of the hour.

Jones insists that 6-mo cutoff will not be automatically applied, but some judges and parole officers see provision as another weakening of comm's control over its charges and are reluctant to send addicts to comm instead of to prison because of what they consider to be its 'sieve-like' retention ability Critics Find State's Program For Addict Care Is in Disarray"},{"year":"2004","title":"Federal appeals panel dismisses case that challenged redrawing of state legislative district lines after 2000 census on grounds of racial discrimination","excerpt":"at core of suit is oddly shaped Bronx Senate District 34, represented by Guy Velella, and whether district was drawn to dilute minority voting strength (M) Judges Dismiss Case Alleging Unfair Redrawing of Districts"},{"year":"1964","title":"s, Cornell U centennial convocation STEVENSON LAUDS","excerpt":"At Cornell, He Asserts They Are Foil to Emotionalism"},{"year":"2001","title":"Interest in studying nuclear engineering has fallen in recent years at college campuses around country, prompting concern that there could be shortages of trained people to run nuclear power plants","excerpt":"at Cornell, trustees voted unanimously to close university's research reactor, only one in New York State;

Nevertheless, even with passenger traffic back to pre-9/11 levels, the domestic airline industry ''is still in financial peril,'' Gary Chase, a Lehman Brothers airline analyst, told Congress in June. While most major network carriers struggle, low-cost carriers like America West, AirTran, Alaska, JetBlue and Southwest are prospering and showing ''rapid growth in market share'' as well as ''ambitious'' expansion plans, he said.    OVERSEAS SQUEEZE -- Space is tighter than ever on trans-Atlantic flights. On the top nine carriers flying between the United States and Europe, load factors, the percentage of seats filled with paying passengers, averaged 87.6 percent in July, according to Donald N.

Just as armies march on their stomachs, food oils government wheels. So, put down that croissant and read this. \\nBRITAIN\\n\\n IN THE TOQUE 10 Downing Street, the Prime Minister's official residence, has no official chef, so Prime Ministers have been known to whip up their own bacon and eggs in the morning. Outside caterers come in for entertaining. The Prime Minister's press office says that \\"for security reasons\\" the caterers are not usually big names. In one case, the arrangement left Prime Minister John Major open to innuendo. Last year, he successfully sued two magazines for libel after they published rumors that he was having an affair with Clare Latimer, whose company, Clare's Kitchen, is one of his favorites.\\n\\nON THE MENU The caterers cook on the premises and are under instructions to use British produce when possible. Lunches are kept to three courses","excerpt":"at dinner, a cheese board is added. The menu for a recent dinner honoring the departing American Ambassador, Raymond G. H. Seitz, included a terrine of leeks and langoustine with a leek-and-grape salad; boned chicken stuffed with forest mushrooms served with roast potatoes and vegetables; a roulade of apricot and almond; a cheese board with Scottish oatcakes, and petit fours.\\n\\nIN THE GOBLET A state secret. \\"We never go into detail about wines because so many people can take umbrage about them,\\" a spokeswoman said.\\nRUSSIA\\n\\n IN THE TOQUE The Kremlin maintains its own staff of chefs, but in April, Michel Roux, the London-based French chef, became the first foreign chef to be invited to cook for the Kremlin since the days of the czars. The occasion was a party given by President Boris N. Yeltsin in the 15th-century Hall of Facets to introduce his book, \\"The Struggle for Russia,\\" to international publishers.\\n\\nON THE MENU Entertaining lavishly is an important sign of status (as it was even in Communist times), and official government banquets run to seven courses. After aperitifs of vintage Dom Perignon, the guests at the book dinner were treated to blini and caviar (with many vodka toasts); cold foie gras on a bed of salad with baby leeks, vinaigrette and truffles; daube de boeuf a la Beaujolais; French cheeses and apple tart with Calvados.\\n\\nPRANDIAL POKE \\"And the Russian chefs, who didn't think my five courses were enough, sneaked in some consomme with dumplings and a plate of cold cured meats and fishes from another kitchen,\\" Mr. Roux ruefully recalled. \\"And at the end of the meal they put big bowls of Jell-O on the table. But I think they trusted me, because my food was not ever checked or tested, although all the preparations were filmed and kept on record.\\" \\nFRANCE\\n\\n IN THE TOQUE Joel Norman, President Francois Mitterrand's chef for 10 years, first worked at the Elysee Palace as a sous-chef in the latter days of President Charles de Gaulle. He cooks all the President's meals and is expected to travel with him.\\n\\nON THE MENU Most official dinners, in the Salle des Fetes, are no more than four courses and must be served in 55 minutes or less. At more leisurely, private dinners, Mr. Mitterrand prefers \\"simple, light\\" food like \\"oysters and grilled sole, or maybe roast chicken and pommes frites,\\" Mr. Norman said. A recent dinner for Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany had two fish courses -- a cold platter of fruits de mer and hot coquilles St.-Jacques -- because \\"the President, who makes all the final menu decisions, couldn't decide between them,\\" Mr. Norman said. \\n\\nPRANDIAL POKE Heads of government should serve \\"their own and French cuisine,\\" he said, \\"but the French President should only ever serve French food and wines.\\"\\nGERMANY\\n\\n IN THE TOQUE Heinrich Daniel, the chef from Steigenberger Petersberg, the big hotel in Bonn, has been Chancellor Kohl's official cook since 1990.\\n\\nON THE MENU \\"We serve mainly traditional German food, but cooked in a new, lighter, more health-conscious way,\\" Mr. Daniel said. The Chancellor, whose girth has been noted by none other than President Clinton, \\"likes everything roasted, and serves German stuffed beef rolls and saumagen -- stuffed pigs stomach -- at his private dinners,\\" Mr. Daniel disclosed. Some people have wondered whether Mr. Kohl really likes the dish or if he just likes to watch foreigners squirm at the thought of stuffed pigs stomach while he digs in lustily. Saumagen was on the menu when President George Bush visited a few years ago; his reaction was described as diplomatic, and it is not recorded how much he sent back to the kitchen.\\n\\nMr. Daniel, who is sent on cooking courses abroad, occasionally likes to cook the cuisine of a visiting leader, so he practiced Japanese dishes for the recent visit of Tsutomu Hata, the Prime Minister of Japan. \\n\\nIN THE GOBLET Wines are always German.\\nITALY\\n\\n IN THE TOQUE The Prime Minister, whose official residence in Rome is the Palazzo Chigi, relies on outside chefs. Special meals, like one for the Emperor of Japan, in 1990, are usually cooked by a chef from Le Coq d'Or, a chic Roman restaurant. \\n\\nON THE MENU Silvio Berlusconi, the new Prime Minister, may change things, but his recent predecessors have followed a simple, four-course formula, with Italian wines. The Japanese Emperor was served prosciutto and melon, farfalle with zucchini flowers, saddle of veal with vegetables, and a semifreddo with wild berries. \\nJAPAN\\n\\n IN THE TOQUE The Prime Minister has a cook in his official residence to prepare routine meals for him and other government officials. For official banquets, top chefs from Japan's greatest hotels and restaurants are called in. Favorites are the Imperial, New Otani and Okura hotels in Tokyo and the Kitcho restaurant in Kyoto.\\n\\nON THE MENU The Group of Seven summit leaders were entertained with a Japanese feast when they convened in Tokyo last July. But the food for state entertaining in Japan is usually French, with statesmen sitting on chairs rather than on cushions. \\"Only when the Prime Minister has a small party of maybe 10 persons, or a party for Japanese people, does he serve Japanese food,\\" a Government spokesman said.\\nCANADA\\n\\n IN THE TOQUE Prime Minister Jean Chretien, who took office seven months ago, has not yet had any state banquets at 24 Sussex Drive, his official residence, in Ottawa. But his resident chef, Jose Moniz, a native of Portugal, is eagerly awaiting the first one.\\n\\nON THE MENU \\"I would start with seafood from the Atlantic or the Pacific, lobster or salmon,\\" said the chef, who adapts traditional French cuisine to accommodate Canadian produce and who shops for the food himself. \\"For the main course, I would serve venison -- caribou or deer -- with seasonal vegetables: fiddleheads in spring, squashes in the fall. For dessert, I would do something with maple in it -- maybe a maple-sugar pie. Wines would be French, with a Canadian white for the first course.\\"\\n\\nIn private, the Prime Minister and his wife, Aline, favor Quebecois ragouts and ice cream with homemade butterscotch sauce made to an old family recipe.

Italicized words were underlined in the English handwritten version.     Charter of Honour      Out of revenge for prestige, patriotism and retarding tyranny and suppresion, I consider those mentioned below as bitter enemies and they must be annihilated & exterminated   1. The First Enemy: Americans -- Britons -- French (though the French now seem friendly after Chirak's visit to Palestine) and the Zionists. These 3 Big Powers are the first enemy to the Palestinians ever since their three-partite Declaration in the early fifties, and they are responsible for turning our people, the Palestians, homeless.  The Zionists are the paw that carried out their savage aggression.  My restless aspiration is to murder as many of them as possible, and I have decided to strike at their own den in New York, and at the very Empire State Building in particular. The Zionists have usurped my father's land at 'Abbassiya near Lydda Airport and which is now worth ten million US dollars at least.   2. The Second Enemy: a gang of rogues who attacked me on Saturday 26/6/1993 at my office in Gaza (Daraj), because I didn't agree to their command asking me to help them cheat in the final examination (Tawjihi). They were seven, and I have so far identified two of them, viz: Ammar Khaleel Darweesh and Mohammad 'Awadh (the latter has a shop for selling water-pipes in Gaza (Zeitoun). If I could identify the others, ready to pay a reward for knowing them, I will kill all of them in revenge for this brutal attack, if I had the chance after the first strike.   3. The Third One: A ranking officer in the Egyptian Police Force, who had insulted and beaten me savagely for some passport formalities when I was in Cairo in the early eighties and without any justification. I didn't know his name, but I located his residence on Sobki Street at Dokki in Cairo, near Egypt Farm Company, and he must be killed with his brother who helped him.   4. The Fourth Target: The three students in Cherkassy town in Ukraine: Mohammad Al-Hadeedy, Sami Abu 'Amra and Mahmould Al-Mohtasseb (the latters residence telephone in Gaza is 861168), all of Gaza, because they had beaten and blackmailed my son Al-Ameer. Sami Abu 'Amra usurped $250 from my son and brutally beat him when he was sick. The first two: Hadeedy and Abu 'Amra must be killed.    It is to be made clear that any act of provocation or offence against me, or any attempt to impede my course of action shall be vigourously combatted whatever the consequences may be.    It is to be placed on record that I must have carried out the first action a long time ago, but I was tied up all through this period with family obligations, observing certain commitments","excerpt":"at first towards my late parents, brothers and only sister, and later toward my children in an endeavour to help them lead a better life and with dignity.

Not only were husband and wife analyzed concurrently, within a few weeks Freud had also assigned them the task of translating a paper he had recently written. This marked the start of the work that was to last them the rest of their lives - it is for their translations, above all for the monumental Standard Edition of Freud's works that James undertook, that they are best remembered. But they had another life as well.

The bustle of passengers faded and some air terminals became uneasily still as travel overseas dropped off precipitately and domestic travel thinned. Uniformed guards multiplied. Close-in parking areas were blockaded to limit damage from any car bombs.   The Federal Aviation Administration for the first time shifted all 435 domestic United States airports from security Level Two to Level Four, the top point, with rules limiting access by nonpassengers and requiring tighter scrutiny for them and their luggage, as well as frequent checks of trash cans, bathrooms and other places where bombs might be hidden. By Jan. 28, when this was written, there was no sign that these precautions might be relaxed.   Overseas, airports that have been the scene of terrorism -- and others -- put into place stringent controls. Travelers were startled to see soldiers in camouflage uniforms and armored vehicles at Heathrow Airport in London. The Athens airport was closed to nonpassengers. Rules in Europe, similar to the F.A.A. regulations, were coordinated through an information network created earlier to combat terrorism. In Germany, passengers were warned they might not be able to take aboard laptop computers or even hair dryers","excerpt":"at Frankfurt, if cameras were large, unfamiliar or caused concern at security barriers, they had to be left behind. United States passengers were warned of this.    American passengers by and large did not complain, but said they welcomed added protection.

He liked that a lot.         I only wish I could have returned the protection.

During the Bach tercentenary year 1985 he performed all the organ works of Bach to great acclaim in thirteen recitals in New York, and was scheduled to repeat this series at the Lincoln Center Festival '98.

The evening began with a strong series of pieces played by Mr. Sharp's guitar quartet, which also included Roger Kleier, David Mecionis and John Myers.

An advertisement for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has a first in New York City politics: a mayor speaking Mandarin in a campaign commercial to make his case for re-election. It is one of several ads in which the mayor speaks a foreign language, including Urdu, Russian and Cantonese, to plead his case. This ad is running on Chinese-language cable-TV stations. A 30-second television ad for Fernando Ferrer, called ''Aramina,'' in which his wife addresses the audience, is among several Spanish-language ads currently being broadcast.    PRODUCER -- Mirram Global.    ON THE SCREEN -- Fernando Ferrer's wife, Aramina, speaks directly to the camera, wearing a buttery yellow jacket and black mock turtleneck. Old photos of Mr. Ferrer flash by: the candidate as a young man in cap and gown","excerpt":"at his wedding; at a swearing-in ceremony, and removing graffiti from the walls of Bronx Borough Hall when he was borough president. Next comes a series of moving images, with Mr. Ferrer speaking to neighborhood voters, interacting with students in a classroom, chatting with voters outside a grocery store and on a typical residential street. The ad returns to Mrs. Ferrer, then ends with Mr. Ferrer striding through a cheering crowd. The tag line ''Dignidad Contra Dinero,'' or Dignity Against Money, appears, along with ''Fernando Ferrer, Dem√≥crata para Alcalde,'' or Fernando Ferrer, Democrat for Mayor.    THE SCRIPT -- As a slow but lively salsa plays in the background, Mrs. Ferrer says in Spanish: ''No one knows Freddy better than I do. Ever since I met him at 17, I have seen the passion with which he has served his community. As a councilman and Bronx borough president, he worked to transform communities with new housing, schools and jobs. As mayor, he will do much more. On Nov. 8, let's elect Fernando Ferrer mayor of New York.''    ACCURACY -- Featuring few specific facts, the ad offers little to quibble with. And who could argue that anyone knows Mr. Ferrer better than his wife?    SCORECARD -- Mrs. Ferrer is a poised and appealing surrogate for her husband, who can come across as stiff and indirect. And although the text focuses on Mr. Ferrer's accomplishments, it also makes a direct appeal to ethnic pride with its tag line, a reference to the many millions Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg is spending on his campaign. But the phrase has at least one more connotation, as dignidad also suggests pride, according to the ad's producer, Luis Miranda. The slogan is inspired by the phrase ''verg√ºenza contra dinero,'' which was part of the campaign of the first governor elected in Puerto Rico, in the 1940's. ''Verg√ºenza'' can mean shame, Mr. Miranda said, but, like ''dignidad,'' it also carries a meaning of standing tall, which back then referred to standing up to the landowners by voting. Although Mr. Ferrer risks criticism that the ad is in some way divisive, it is similar to other Spanish-language ads that seek to stir ethnic pride with culturally resonant phrases, like those featuring Mr. Ferrer that end with him saying, ''Gracias, familia, gracias,'' or ''Thank you, family, thank you.''

With its tall, airy bamboo stalks set off by walls of charcoal granite, the atrium of the I.B.M. Building, at 590 Madison Avenue at 56th Street, resembles a cross between a public park and a corporate lobby. But a skirmish has broken out over the future of this serene midtown oasis. The I.B.M. atrium is one of those tense pieces of New York turf, the privately owned public space. Now the tension has erupted again into a conflict over where the line between public and private should be drawn.   Edward Minskoff, the owner of the I.B.M. Building, has applied to the City Planning Commission for permission to convert part of the atrium into an exhibition space for sculpture. The plan has been approved by Community Board 5 but opposed by the Municipal Art Society, a civic group. Two of the 13-member City Planning Commission, Brenda Levin and Amanda M. Burden, say they oppose the plan. Joseph Rose, the commission's chairman, said he and Mr. Minskoff were discussing ways to revise it.

Investors who scorned McKesson in the past as a boring drug wholesaler are palpitating over the growing importance of the company's PCS unit in the booming drug discount field.   McKesson shares have risen 15 percent since the announcement on July 28 that Merck & Company, the world's largest drug maker, was paying $6 billion for one of PCS's rivals, Medco Containment Services, a large drug discounter.

It did not end  because this was Mindy Sokalsky's last chance for glory, and she was not going to let it pass her by. And it did not end because Marsha Harris, the team's spiritual leader, managed to avoid getting a fifth foul down the stretch.         Sokalsky, a senior guard who seldom gets the attention her backcourt mates Harris and Jen Krolikowski do, hit all six of her free-throw attempts in the game's final 2 minutes 43 seconds and made two critical steals to thwart Rowan's hopes for a perfect season. And Harris's return with four fouls and her team trailing by 8 points with 7:45 remaining sparked the Violets to a dramatic 68-63 victory and their first Division III East Sectional championship.

Such a story had a happy ending in the Bronx last Tuesday when the Castle, a renovated 223-unit, seven-building complex of Tudor-style apartments at 1950 Andrews Avenue, opened for tenants after years of struggle over the management of the Federal housing rehabilitation grant that helped pay for the project.   The Castle was originally foreclosed by the city for nonpayment of taxes during the recession of the mid-70's. In the following years, a struggle dragged on between community groups and the Department of Housing Preservation and Development over ownership of the building. A group of housing activists claimed they held the mortgage on the property, while the city insisted that foreclosure was final, and picked Sydney Engel, of Lynbrook, L.I., for a gut rehabilitation.

On Monday, the minority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, offered to let four judicial nominations go through if the rule-change threat is dropped. On Thursday, the majority leader, Bill Frist of Tennessee, offered to limit the rule change to nominations for higher courts, not lower courts or legislative matters.    Behind the News -- Both parties want to be seen as reasonable, not arrogant or obstructionist, as they seek to win over the handful of Republicans who have not yet said where they stand on filibuster rules. One, Arlen Spector of Pennsylvania, is chairman of the Judiciary Committee.    SOCIAL SECURITY    Focus on Solvency -- The Senate Finance Committee held its first full-scale debate on proposals for revamping Social Security. The committee heard presentations on ways to shore up the system's future finances, and discussed the Bush administration's proposal to allow some payroll tax money to be diverted from the system into private investment accounts.    Behind the News -- The debate is moving away from the president's proposal for private accounts, whose chances for passage this year appear to be evaporating, and toward an issue the president raised in arguing for them, the long-term solvency of Social Security. For the first time, the president offered some specific ideas on that front at his news conference Thursday evening. But therein lies a political problem: Dealing with the solvency issue will probably require some combination of benefit cuts, tax increases and bigger budget deficits -- all unpalatable without the sweetener of private accounts.    BOLTON NOMINATION    Rescue Mode -- Heavyweight figures in the Bush administration, including Vice President Dick Cheney and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, weighed in with phone calls to senators and coordinated public remarks intended to salvage the faltering nomination of John R. Bolton to be ambassador to the United Nations. Karl Rove, the White House deputy chief of staff, spoke out forcefully in support of Mr. Bolton in an interview with USA Today.    Behind the News -- A single defection among the 10 Republicans on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee would doom the nomination and give the president a political black eye","excerpt":"at least 4 of the 10 have expressed doubts about Mr. Bolton.    IRAQ    New Government -- On Thursday, after months of negotiations, the Iraqi National Assembly approved a multi-ethnic cabinet led by Ibrahim al-Jaafari, a Shiite Arab, that will take office next week. It includes four deputy prime ministers one each for the Shiites, Sunni Arabs, Kurds and Turkmen and assigns slightly more than half the ministerial portfolios to Shiites.    Behind the News -- The deal marks the resurgence of Ahmad Chalabi, the former exile and Pentagon favorite who helped make the case for invading Iraq with information that has since been discredited, and who has been convicted of embezzlement in Jordan. He will be a deputy prime minister and the interim oil minister; a nephew of his will be finance minister; and the interior minister will be from a party that backs his drive to purge ex-Baathists from the government and army, a major source of friction with Sunni leaders.    FEDERAL SPENDING    Budget Resolution -- Congress adopted a $2.56 trillion federal budget for 2006 on Thursday evening, breaking a long impasse. The resolution passed the Senate by five votes and the House by just three. The resolution calls for a freeze on most federal spending, though not for domestic security or the military.    Behind the News -- On the last two major sticking points, opponents were able to force a deal on one but not the other. Senator Gordon H. Smith of Oregon, leader of a group of moderate Republicans who oppose cuts in Medicaid, forced the cuts to be scaled back by about four-fifths. And he got what he wanted in their place: a bipartisan commission to study Medicaid's future. In the House, a number of Republicans broke party ranks and voted against the resolution because of a provision that could allow Congress to open the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling without the threat of a Senate filibuster. But party leaders rounded up enough yes votes without them.

Paris rather shocks him and his art rather shocks Paris, or those with whom he comes into contact. There they paint the soul of things. Vergil Crock, one of the francless band, is proud of his portrait of a whistle, which pretends to be the \\"blow\\" and not the whistle. Mention of this encourages all the Americans and Russians of the Street of the Three Angels to sing of their special form of art.Love enters the doors of the ramshackle dwelling when our frightened friend, Duncan, who appears to have lost most of his Southern drawl on the way across the Atlantic, becomes enamored of Kay Loring. This is not surprising. There is a contretemps, as ever, and with a certain eclat, the friendly relations between Kay and Duncan are resumed eventually.The starving Russians, also a part of the students' quarter, and the starving artists, are ready to pounce upon any one's food. Crock has no compunction in stealing most of a breakfast set for Kay and Duncan. The sinister little blonde, called Nada, sets her cap at Duncan while he and Kay are doleful over a spat.If you are partial to comic duels, there is one here and Crock is called upon to be one of the pistoleers, much to his chagrin. His motto is fire, run and bury your face in the mud. At least he survives through these tactics. Arthur Copeland, a singer and pianist, contributes nicely to the melody jhases of this jolly pictorial party. Mr. Copeland is ably played by Walter Woolf.As for the hero, Duncan, one knows that sooner or later he will prove that he can paint the stuff other artists have succeeded in doing. He daubs a canvas and calls it \\"The Wheel of Life.\\" The utterly futuristic work wins a prize, but the artist is sorely disgruntled, for the powers that be decide that it is only worthy of distinction when it is upside down.Charles Farrell does fairly well as Duncan. Marguerite Churchill is capital as Kay. Charles Ruggles is extraordinarily funny as Crock. Gregory Ratoff handles the r√¥le of a Russian general who officiates as the janitor of the house in the Street of the Three Angels. Mr. Ratoff is excellent. Grace Bradley is satisfactory as Nada.

They were laboratories for composers, who knew the capabilities of their players and often stretched them, and who were guaranteed performances that were entirely under their control.

As the story of an idle American tramp steamer, taken out of New York harbor by ruse and commandeered on the high seas by the German Navy for use as a raider in American waters, the film is run-of-the-mill melodrama with indifferent performances and a little more action than most. There is a good deal of suspense in the shots of the torpedoes' wake as they speed toward an unarmed passenger ship, the attempted escape by an imprisoned American crew, the sinking of vessels in shallow waters to serve as fueling bases for submarines, the final sinking of the raider under the fire of a British cruiser.But in creating a fiction upon the gravest issues of the day, Paramount deserves a critical warning salvo across the bow in making capital of those issues for the sake of a pretentious, essentially cops-and-robbers melodrama. It is all right for Henry Wilcoxon, as the shanghied captain, to say that one Yankee can beat a crew of cutthroats, but when he says that he can lick the whole German Navy it is more than cheap bravado. It is like a youngster playing at cops and robbers with a loaded .45.

Let injustice fall upon some stranger and in no time at all Maisie has taken up the cudgels and fallen in love to boot. A honky-tonk Joan of Arc, Maisie has learned in heaven knows how many films that in life you pay your way as you go along and don't expect any favors. Probably she will be the least disappointed that her newest picture, with a background that seems to have been suggested by A. J.

Enter Red Skelton, as a stage-struck country boy with a headful of corny gags, and Miss Sothern as a down-and-out lady hoofer and you have the elements of another sentimental saga in Maisie's star-crossed career. But somehow, \\"Maisie Gets Her Man\\" just limps along without ever being very amusing or ruefully touching. The script lacks the flavor of Mr. Liebling's series of articles, the direction is ambling, and even Mr. Skelton labors heroically over some soggy material‚Äîand all to little avail.But Maisie, no doubt, will recover.

The story of a female gangster and her brood of plug-uglies who come to grief one by one, it is the latest and by all odds most morbid study of crime and retribution yet lifted from J. Edgar Hoover's printed reminiscences on the subject. As a morality fable it has more violence than point. As cops-and-robbers drama it's as exciting at times as a good dog fight, but a lot more depressing. Besides, Hollywood doth protest so much that crime doesn't pay that one suspects its pontificial moralizing is less than disinterested. Perhaps it does pay after all‚Äîat the box office, for instance?Blanche Yurka, of course, is in her element in the central role. Though she occasionally pauses to pull the emotional stops of maternal affection, she is usually the sort of mother that only her sons could love, declaiming her lines like a malevolent fury in Greek tragedy. In an assortment of homey disguises she leads her unnatural spawn on a series of bank robberies and kidnappings that net them $400,000 in hot money.The loot is \\"hot\\" and with Ralph Bellamy as an F.B.I. agent close on their trail the family sets put on a cross-country safari in which their doom closes in on them singly and inexorably.

Mr. Cronyn as the boy (a soldier this time) is so aware of his unhandsomeness that he sends the girl a picture of his best buddy, representing it as himself. Of course, the buddy is handsome, and a wolf to boot. This results in the usual entanglements before the happy ending. John Carroll makes a proper heel of the wolfish buddy, while Marsha Hunt is sufficiently sweet as the girl. But the chief attraction here is Hume Cronyn, if only for his hilarious drunken scene, feigned to keep the girl away from his buddy's advances. With some stringent cutting, and a good deal less sentimentalism, this could have been a uniformly sparkling comedy.

Sweeter Lemons  Meyer lemons, the sweeter-tasting, juicier lemons preferred by many pastry chefs on the West Coast, are now being grown for commercial production in California's Central Valley. Before last year they were mainly a home-gardener's crop. And now some are arriving in markets in the East.   The season will run for the next six weeks. The lemons, which are a darker-gold color than regular lemons and have shinier, thinner, less pebbly skins, are $4.95 a pound (about 6 to the pound) at Dean & DeLuca, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street; Balducci's, 424 Avenue of the Americas, at Ninth Street, $2.98 a pound, and $2.75 a pound at Agata & Valentina, 1505 First Avenue, at 79th Street. Fairway Market, 1214 Anderson Avenue, Fort Lee, N.J., has them for $2.89 a pound.   The lemons are named for Frank Meyer, who worked for the United States Department of Agriculture around the turn of the century. He found the lemons -- thought to be a cross between a lemon and an orange -- growing near Beijing, and introduced them to California in 1908.   Even though they are less sensitive to cold than other lemons, they were not grown commercially until a new hybrid was developed that was not prone to carry a virus harmful to other citrus. And they are highly perishable, making them less appealing to commercial growers and shippers than regular lemons.   If you call a store asking about them, the answer might well be, Meyer who? Ask for the produce manager, who may have a better answer. Kosher Cooking School  The Institute of Kosher Culinary Arts is a new cooking school featuring demonstrations, lectures and workshops in a range of subjects, including French bistro, Chinese, spa, pasta, pastry, Italian and vegetarian. It is sponsored by Jem-Prestige, a Kosher caterer.

The plastic unit is operated with a hand-crank that forces the block of frozen juice or fruit puree against the steel blade. The blade is adjustable for fine to coarse textures.    Ingredients for the slush can be frozen in the plastic mold that is part of the gadget. One mold makes about four servings. To make a granite, coarsely shaved slush must be refrozen. The Hawaiice shaver is $49.95 and is available from the Front Gate catalogue: (800) 626-6488.

This New Year's Eve is James Blood Ulmer's sixth at the Knitting Factory, which sounds a bit like a tradition. The guitarist has recorded with everyone from Ornette Coleman to Art Blakey and Joe Henderson. His current music, which makes uses of drones and odd tunings, is distinct. It's hard-rocking, slippery music charged with power, except when he sings. Defunct is a hard funk-and-noise band that remembers the early 1980's. The sets start at 10 P.M. The $20 cover includes a free drink and a Champagne toast. P. W. JAZZ John Hicks   John Hicks, Bradley's, 70 University Place, Greenwich Village, (212) 228-6440. John Hicks is an articulate, active pianist who always plays as if the present chorus is the last. He is to be backed by the bassist David Williams and the drummer Victor Lewis, which is an exceptional rhythm section. It is to be interactive, a three-way musical conversation at its best. The show is to start at 9 P.M., and $115 buys a five-course dinner and Champagne. The cover without a meal is $25, with a $20 minimum. From 1 A.M. to 4 A.M., the cover is $20, with a $15 minimum. P.

Michael White's New Year's shows are becoming a tradition, and they should be. This clarinetist leads what may be the best New Orleans-style band in jazz. It's raucous, with tight ensemble parts giving way to the polyphonic group improvisations that bray and holler. The band invites listeners into a time warp and makes them understand why the music so quickly became the popular dance music of its era. It traffics in joy. Sets are at 9:30, 11:30 and 1:30 P.M. There is a $40 cover and a $20 minimum. P. W. Dennis Jeter Big Band    Dennis Jeter Big Band, Iridium, 44 West 63d Street, Manhattan, (212) 582-2121. Mr. Jeter, a trumpeter, leads the Iridium jam session every Monday night, and he has put together a big band to help people dance in the New Year. The music will start at 10 P.M. and will not be stopping until after 2 A.M.; $150 a person includes a four-course dinner, a bottle of Champagne for each couple and a bagel buffet at 2 A.M. The $75 cover at the bar allows a listener to drink anything, all night long. P. W. Jimmy Witherspoon    Jimmy Witherspoon, Fat Tuesday's, 190 Third Avenue, at 17th Street, Manhattan, (212) 533-7900. One of the last of the great blues shouters is to treat an audience to classic stanzas of the blues. He can have a sweetness to his voice as well, and he's always ready to improvise on jazz standards, all of which come with a blues nastiness to them. Sets are at 8:30 and 11 P.M. and 1 A.M. There is a $25 cover charge and a $15 minimum, which will include party favors, at the appropriate moment. P. W.

Upstairs, for $110, patrons receive a four-course dinner with unlimited Champagne, starting around 8 to 10 P.M. and staying all night. Downstairs, for $60, one can dance, drink at an open bar and eat hors d'whatevers, starting at 9:30 P.M. P. W. Saxophones and More    Gerry Gibbs, Ravi Coltrane, Mark Turner and John Swana, Smalls, 183 West 10th Street, West Village, (212) 929-7565.

That is to start at 10 P.M.; at 4 A.M., Frank Hewitt on piano, Victor Gaskin on bass and Jimmy Lovelace on drums are to come on, and there's music, as usual, until 8 in the morning. P. W. Two Pianists    Hank Jones and Jacky Terrasson, Sweet Basil, 88 Seventh Avenue South, above Bleeker Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 242-1785.

LATIN Tito Puente   Tito Puente, S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940. The percussionist and band leader Tito Puente is to spin his sticks over his head, dance a bit, stick out his tongue and egg his orchestra on to bigger and better music. He's a titan who understands the nexus between music and entertainment, and when he convenes a salsa orchestra, it's hard to find tougher dance music. The $175 package includes a five-course dinner starting at 8 P.M.; Champagne and breakfast at dawn; $90 includes appetizers, starting at 10:30 P.M., Champagne and breakfast; for $50, one can enjoy the music from 12:30 on until breakfast.
