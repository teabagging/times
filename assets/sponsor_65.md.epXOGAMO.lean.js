Earlier he'd been deported from England, canceled in Australia (after he told a rude story about the Crucifixion), and busted on various charges (usually for obscenity, several times for narcotics) in Philadelphia, Miami and San Francisco, among other places. Following his death, however, life, as it has a way of doing when it's too late, suddenly looked up for the man who had died a pauper.A filmed record of one of his last appearances (\\"Lenny Bruce\\") was released in 1967. The next year, the New York Supreme Court reversed a criminal court's ruling and found his nightclub act to have had redeeming social value—which might have amused Lenny, who thought redeeming social value a rather silly criterion to be judged by.At least two legitimate plays on his life have been in the works","excerpt":"Albert Goldman is writing what a friend of mine is sure will be the definitive biography, and one feature film has actually been made. The movie is called \\"Dirtymouth\\" and it opened yesterday at the Penthouse and R. K. O. 59th Street Twin Cinemas.\\"Dirtymouth\\" is a very bad movie that can't quite make up its mind whether Bruce, played by Bernie Travis, who vaguely resembles the star, was a young Tom Edison, ahead of his time, or the sort of mad doctor who must be punished for tampering with the secrets of the universe. Quite early in the film, a worried nightclub patron, who has been listening to one of Bruce's milder monologues, says with the awe of someone who has just seen an atom smashed: \\"There's no telling where a thing like this could lead!\\" Later on, one of the star's admirers states flatly: \\"Lenny Bruce is the past, the present and the future!\\"The truth of the matter is that Bruce was a very good, if not great, comedian, who was sidetracked, and who was very much a product of his time, the uptight 1950's. One of the ironies \\"Dirtymouth\\" seems bent on not recognizing is the fact that, five years after his death, the words that Lenny was prosecuted for using are now to be heard in any number of neighborhood movie houses. The revolution that Lenny spearheaded has come and almost gone. Society hasn't collapsed into a gibbering mess, but then it hasn't been completely liberated either.\\"Dirtymouth,\\" which covers Bruce's career from the late 1950's until his death of an apparent overdose of narcotics, talks quite a lot about the comedian's brilliance while demonstrating—in its choice of material and in the performance—that he wouldn't have made a decent second banana to Pal Joey.

Altman, the writer-director-producer, has, in addition to hiring more bad actors than I can remember seeing in one film in 20 years, tried to make his simple little screenplay look a good deal more complex than it is.In what can only be called misguided attempts at pure cinema, Altman, several times, tries to find the movie equivalents to Bruce's narrative style. He dramatizes Bruce's story about how Jesus was arrested in Miami (because He carried no identification), and he presents us with montages showing us the judges and the district attorneys, who prosecuted Bruce on various occasions, in grotesque, musical comedy make-up. It doesn't really work. I suppose that legal reasons may be responsible for the brush-off the film gives to the star's drug problems, as well as to other areas of his private life.\\"Dirtymouth\\" has so little on its mind, so little to offer, that while I was watching it yesterday morning at the Penthouse, I wondered if, perhaps, it wasn't watching me.

This includes foiling a crook who sets out to mulct her father of $50,000, saving her sister's good name, saving her own, warning her modern mother against affairs with other men, warning her father against the same with other women and being a complete nuisance, a Pollyanna, a little Miss Fixit and a \\"sweet young thing,\\" all rolled into one annoying rôle.The others in the photoplay appear at odd moments.

But the drama, which began a stand at the Criterion on Saturday, is an indictment which loses a great deal of its effect by lapsing into run-of-the-mill plot lines. Its preachment is indeed honorable, but its execution lacks punch and conviction.This independent group has chosen to focus its attention on Ann Walton, a mid-Western office worker, who, blissfully happy on her engagement to the man of her choice, is brutally attacked. The shock of her harrowing experience, as well as her reactions to her family, friends and townspeople is, like the events leading up to the assault, given sharp and effective treatment.However, the depiction of subsequent events as she seeks sanctuary in escape from her surroundings is less than inspired. The kindly, young minister who bolsters her faith, as well as the people for whom she works, and the young blade she blindly attacks when he unwittingly waxes amorous, are, despite their serious characterizations, obvious and sometimes trite.As the dazed and frightened cause of it all, Mala Powers, seen here recently in \\"Edge of Doom,\\" is an attractive performer who gives the role depth and sincerity. Tod Andrews, as the clergyman, who, in proving to her that we \\"all go through dark times\\" convinces his terrified charge to return to her hearth, manages to make his portrayal intense, if not entirely stirring.And, among the comparative newcomers in the cast who turn in adequate supporting stints are Robert Clarke, as the fiancé","excerpt":"Albert Mellen, as the degenerate; Raymond Bond and Lillian Hamilton, as her, parents and Kenneth Patterson and Angela Clarke, as the fruit ranchers who give the shocked heroine employment and a home.Miss Lupino and company, in short, are pointing—in good taste—to a social blight.

The vehicle this time is ''Inside the Third Reich,'' a five-hour production to be shown on ABC-TV Sunday at 8 P.M. and Monday at 9 P.M. It is based on the memoirs of Albert Speer, the confessed war criminal who spent 20 years in a German prison for his slave-labor program to manufacture munitions in World War II.   In other words, viewed from any perspective, this is a review of Hitler's Germany as seen through the eyes of a powerful and influential Nazi and it primarily presents as reality his own view of things - a point much in dispute. The basic question is, How was the cultivated son of a proper German family seduced by Adolf Hitler? E.  Jack Neuman, the writer and producer of the film, has concluded: ''He knew exactly what he was doing, and he wasn't duped or anything else. He was a sinner by omission and commission, and he went wading right in. His problem wasn't blindness. It was blind ambition.''

The experience of Mr. Rushdie, and the numerous attempts to suppress free speech that Mr. Peters says he has seen in his travels around the world, which include stays in Argentina and China, prompted him and his wife to establish the million-dollar fellowship.    \\"It made me very aware of a right we so often take for granted, the right to speak and write freely, and that all the textbook reading doesn't bring home,\\" said Mr. Peters, who had previously donated 5 percent of the royalties from his most recent book, \\"Thriving on Chaos\\" (Alfred A. Knopf), to the A.C.L.U. for First Amendment projects. He is also co-author of \\"In Search of Excellence\\" (Harper & Row) and \\"Passion for Excellence\\" (Random House).   Tonight's reception is being jointly sponsored by Ira Glasser, executive director of the A.C.L.U.","excerpt":"Alberto Vitale, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Random House, and Sonny Mehta, president and editor in chief of Knopf.    Mr. Peters acknowledged that books like his, about business and organization, do not usually test people's tolerance. But he said he thought the fellowship was needed because \\"free speech is only innocent when we zealously protect not only stuff that is not controversial but stuff we may find offensive.\\" The Power of the Airwaves    It looked like the season was almost over for Brendan Boyd, whose first novel, \\"Blue Ruin,\\" was published in September by W. W. Norton. The book, a fictitious account of the motivations behind the actual fixing of the 1919 World Series between the Chicago White Sox and the Cincinnati Reds, had done modestly at the book stores.    It's your first time at bat, the publisher told the writer. It's a solid single. You'll do better next time.   Then Mr. Boyd did an interview on National Public Radio's \\"Morning Edition,\\" and suddenly the game wasn't quite over. Sales of the book started picking up across the country. Bookstore owners started calling wholesale distributors for refills and the book popped onto the best-seller lists of Ingram and of Baker & Taylor, two of the biggest wholesalers in the country.   NPR has apparently become a priceless promotional opportunity for authors. An interview or a review on any of the three main programs -- \\"Morning Edition,\\" \\"All Things Considered\\" and \\"Weekend Edition\\" -- practically assures a rise in sales.   Mr. Boyd was interviewed and given a rave review by Bill Littlefield, a sports commentator, on \\"Morning Edition\\" on Dec. 19, \\"and within two days, the book was zooming, after it had basically been doing modestly until then,\\" said Bill Rusin, director of sales and marketing for Norton. \\"That interview pretty much doubled the rate of sales.\\"   John Cunningham, Baker & Taylor's director of merchandising for juvenile and trade books, said \\"Blue Ruin\\" was registering quiet sales, many of them to libraries, when \\"suddenly it went berserk,\\" going from unranked to the No. 7 fiction best seller.   \\"No doubt about it, NPR has become a real force for selling books,\\" Mr. Cunningham said. \\"We see it all the time. They have the demographics in their audience and they have serious book buyers who listen to them.\\"   People who work for the three shows say that given the deluge of books they receive each day, the power of the shows is obviously no longer an inside secret shared by few. The decision to interview an author or review a book is made mostly by the various hosts and commentators, whose tastes are described by members of their staff as \\"wildly eclectic.\\"    \\"I can't say there are particular criteria for getting a book on,\\" said Brigid McCarthy, editorial assistant for \\"Morning Edition.\\" \\"It's whatever seems to give an added dimension to a news event, or something completely off the news, or a new writer, or an established writer. There's no way to know what will get chosen.\\"   An author who can't get on NPR, however, need not despair. Mr. Cunningham of Baker & Taylor said there was one other show that he had seen push sales of a book: the morning television program \\"Live With Regis and Kathie Lee.\\" Book Notes"},{"year":"1995","title":"The Alberto-Culver Company said yesterday that it had agreed to acquire St. Ives Laboratories Inc. for $15 a share, or about $120 million.

In order to be called a song, must a piece of music have a recognizable melody? Philip Glass's often hauntingly ethereal ''Songs From Liquid Days'' (CBS Masterworks 39564","excerpt":"album, cassette, compact disc) is a record that raises such questions. After many listenings, one can hear the textures of the music resonate in the mind and recall many of the lyrics by Mr. Glass's four collaborators but still not be able to call up more than a few snatches of melody. Yet Mr. Glass specifically designates as songs this sequence of vocalized poems performed mostly by ''pop'' singers.   ''Songs From Liquid Days'' is also an interesting example of how a composer's style can dictate lyrical tone and subject matter. In creating this cycle, Mr. Glass enlisted as lyricists four of New York's most respected pop songwriters with poetic leanings - Paul Simon, Suzanne Vega, David Byrne and Laurie Anderson. On their individual records, these four have highly distinctive literary personalities. Mr. Simon's lyrical style interweaves powerful surreal images with a vestigial rock and roll slanginess and whimsy. Miss Vega freezes hot emotions in miniature, precisely detailed still-lifes. Mr. Byrne's nervous, fragmentary observations are infused with a sense of crisis as they view the human predicament from multiple perspectives. Laurie Anderson likes to explore the ironic resonances beneath the surface of pop slogans.

The 1900's were the disc era, when both musicians and listeners took for granted that music could be captured and repeated. Not too long from now it may be seen as a brief historical interlude between sheet music and the Internet.    The phonograph was treated as a dictation machine for a decade after Thomas Edison invented it in 1877. Cylinders of recorded music were first sold in 1890. But in 1901 the cylinder gave way to the disc, and the rest is in the grooves. Recording preserved music that would have vanished into the air, and it changed practically everything else that was related, from the length of songs to the way they were performed, learned, sold and savored.

But actors have to be half-mad to star in Tennessee Williams's drama on Broadway, where the glare is unforgiving and the ghosts of Elia Kazan's original 1947 production, as magnified by the director's classic 1951 film version, are fierce. Stacked against Marlon Brando, the first Stanley Kowalski, and Jessica Tandy and Vivien Leigh, the stage and screen originators of Blanche DuBois, who can win?    The exciting news from the Ethel Barrymore Theater, where Gregory Mosher's new Broadway staging of \\"Streetcar\\" arrived last night, is that Alec Baldwin has won. His Stanley is the first I've seen that doesn't leave one longing for Mr. Brando, even as his performance inevitably overlaps his predecessor's. Mr. Baldwin is simply fresh, dynamic and true to his part as written and lets the echoes fall where they may. While his Stanley does not in the end ignite this play's explosive power, that limitation seems imposed not by his talent but by the production surrounding him and, especially, by his unequal partner in unhinged desire, Jessica Lange's Blanche DuBois.

It is also true that any actor must perform the role in Mr. Brando's wake. But Alec Baldwin is a sex object in his own right, and he has a sheaf of good reviews to prove that his is not just another pretty torso.\\n\\nNo, the first B-word in Mr. Baldwin's case is Kim Basinger, his live-in companion and fellow miscreant on the set of \\"The Marrying Man.\\" When the film flopped, he broke a powerful law of Hollywood -- never publicly bite the hand that feeds -- and faced the B-list (the other B-word), a purgatory where actors may go if they defy that law.

He frolicked and fenced with a mass murderer in \\"Kind Hearts and Coronets\\" and he gleefully joined in the depredations of robbers and smugglers in \\"The Lavender Hill Mob.\\" In \\"The Man in the White Suit,\\" he enacted a research chemist who pulled a fast one on his boss. And now, in his latest. \\"The Promoter,\\" he is playing an unabashed rogue.Well, that may be putting it harshly, for the fellow whom Mr. Guinness plays in this new British comedy at the Fine Arts is not exactly a bona fide crook. He is simply an enterprising young man who, in order to make his way in a hard world, invents and resorts to maneuvers a scrupulous person might call sharp. And the only real competition he meets as he pursues his blithe career is an equally crafty young lady, played by Glynis Johns. Neither of these young folk is roguish. They're just fast at embracing the main chance. And the whole amusement and delight in the picture is watching how neatly they perform.Mr. Guinness' character is a young man, son of a washerwoman in a British industrial town back in the Edwardian era, who, by cheating just a bit when very young, has got himself an education in a high-class public school. By forging his name on an invitation, he gets himself to the countess' ball, elevates his social position and marks himself as a fellow to watch. By outwitting his ponderous employer, he becomes a successful collector of rents, a slick operator of an installment-purchase combine and eventually Mayor of the town. Here and there he even picks up some loose change in a fast deal at salvaging a boat.And Miss Johns—well, she's a young lady whom our artful promoter meets when he's trying to collect some back rent she owes on her dancing school. A very deceptive miss, this one. Before our hero, with his confident air, has so much as threatened to call the bailiff, she has boffed him with her innocent round eyes. And before the picture is over, she has knotted him up a few times until he—well, his trick on this young lady is the one slim surprise of the film.And there lies the weakness of this picture. As a sketch of two characters, it is grand, even though the depths of the two characters are never revealed or even probed. Mr. Guinness' scamp is a cross-view of innocent-appearing treacheries—a seeming Milquetoast with monstrous cunning, on whom it is impossible to put your thumb. And Miss Johns' self-propelling young lady is a bundle of feminine guile, but she too is full of contradictions and apparent cross-purposes.As the countess, Valerie Hobson is lovely and spirited, Petula Clark is sweet as a lady-like thing and Edward Chapman, George Devine and several others are excellent in small provincial roles.But the script Eric Ambler has adapted from Arnold Bennett's old novel, \\"The Card,\\" is provokingly uninfested with dramatic compulsion or push. It just ambles along very gently from one situation to the next, permitting Mr. Guinness primarily to round out his faintly shocking sketch. The trick on Miss Johns is a contrivance with which to wrap up the film. \\"The Promoter,\\" while vastly amusing in spots, is not a first-rate Guinness show.

Only occasionally does the film take on that satiric sparkle that has become the hallmark of the better French works. Mainly, however, it is of a pattern that was old when the talkies were new.The yarn, a maze of misunderstandings, is nonetheless obvious and pedestrian. Because of an innocent involvement with a jealous, middle-aged music publisher and his brassy mistress, Panard, the young composer, loses jobs and the opportunity to get his operetta published. In desperation the impoverished musician becomes a regular tenant of the Salvation Army's hostel. It is only through his resolute sweetheart's efforts to persuade a marquis to do the right thing that Panard's opus finally is produced.Fernand Gravet, as the harried tunesmith","excerpt":"Alerme, as the choleric publisher; Jeanne Aubert, as the latter's girl friend, and Jacqueline Francell, as Gravet's sweetheart, are merely adequate in their respective roles.

Ms. Sanguinetti's color photographs were shot on farms in Argentina, and most depict domesticated animals and edible livestock -- sounds kind of snooze-inducing, right? But the artist has lowered her camera to ground level to capture moments of tender and poignant interaction between the animals (including two kids, right). Some of the animals appear in later frames slaughtered, skinned and dangling from poles or ropes, ready for the butcher's chopping block. Everything is depicted with a cold objectivity bordering on the clinical, while the heavy black wood box frames surrounding the prints look like miniature coffins. We even see the bloody instruments used for the carnage, all of which might be tolerable were it not captured in lush C prints that enhance the color and details. This contrast of the slick ravishment of the prints and the frequent gross-out of the subject matter is part of what makes the images so arresting and thought-provoking. You may not like what you see here, but the exhibition is completely unforgettable.

Jeanne LeVasseur, an instructor at Yale's School of Nursing and a family nurse in outpatient clinics, coordinated the session and is one of the poets.    The program is called \\"Healing Words: The Practice of Poetry in the Healing Arts.\\" But Ms. LeVasseur said:    \\"We don't use poetry as a therapeutic modality, although that is something that is being considered, just as music, art and dance are used therapeutically.    \\"Speaking for myself, writing poetry helps me interpret and understand what I do as a nurse. There is a link between paying a great deal of attention to what a patient is saying in order to understand him or her and paying that kind of attention to an environment that suggests an idea for a poem.\\"    Her colleagues in the reading will be Belle Waring, an intensive-care unit nurse from George Washington University Hospital in Washington, and Theodore Deppe, a psychiatric nurse from Natching Hospital in Mansfield. All three have been students in a master's degree program in poetry at Vermont College.    \\"We will be reading mostly from a selection of poems that come out of our work,\\" said Ms. LeVasseur. \\"They can be kind of troubling, and they are not the ones that we would choose to read elsewhere.\\"    The session will be held in the Beaumont Room of the School of Medicine, 333 Cedar Street, New Haven, and there is no charge for admission. For more information, call 785-5494. FOLK ROCK     Gruppa Yabloko is Russian for Apple Group, and while that may sound like a computer-based mutual fund, it is a folk-rock ensemble from Leningrad. Marina Kapura, the lead vocalist, has been described by Pete Seeger as \\"the Joan Baez of the Soviet Union.\\" Her husband, Yuri Berendyukov, is the guitarist","excerpt":"Alexander Brovko plays the harmonica and guitar, Victor Potolov is a vocalist, and Sergei Smolyaninov is a singer and keyboardist who also plays the harmonica and the goosly, a traditional Russian stringed instrument.    The group will give two performances in Connecticut this week. The first is on Monday at 7:30 P.M. in the Rogers Park Junior High School on Rogers Park Road in Danbury, where admission will be $5 at the door. The second show is scheduled at 7:30 P.M. on Wednesday at Roaring Brook Nature Center on Gracey Road in Canton. Admission will be $12, and reservations may be made by calling 693-0263. TEXTBOOK OF CRAFTS     For more than two decades, the Creative Arts Workshop in New Haven has held an annual craft show that is a textbook of the best in American crafts. Always scheduled before Christmas, it can provide one-stop shopping for those who are inclined to give gifts of art. The 22d edition will run through Dec. 23 at the workshop's headquarters, 80 Audubon Street.    Whimsy and humor as well as beauty and fine worksmanship are be found in the one-of-a-kind items that attract buyers from several states each year. The range of items is wide: Sally Rooney's tables are adorned with cartoon paintings that cover the surfaces. E. Wynne Noble's functional earthenware bowls, platters and vases are executed in bold orange, black and white spots and striations. And there is a large assortment of tree ornaments that includes some made of hand-blown glass.    Unusual jewelry priced from $4 to $400 is on dislpay, as well as jewelry boxes that are shaped like pyramids, palaces, or simple wooden rectangles embellished with lacquer. And there are painted-canvas floor coverings that are gaining acceptance as an alternative to rugs, plus a broad selection of knitted sweaters and jackets, woven silk scarves and men's ties in a blend of silk, cotton and wool.    In addition, there are sturdy wooden toys, soft-sculptured dolls, fireplace tools and all manner of paper products and ceramics. The workshop is open Monday to Saturday from 11 A.M. to 5 P.M. and Sunday from 2 to 5 P.M. The phone number is 562-4927. RUSSIAN PLAYWRIGHTS     Contemporary theater in the Soviet Union is the subject of a festival and symposium at Trinity College in Hartford on Friday from 2 to 11 P.M., Saturday from 9 A.M. to 11 P.M., and next Sunday from 10:30 A.M. to 1 P.M.    Of special interest are two plays to be performed with the participation of their Russian playwrights. They are \\"Stars in the Morning Sky\\" by Alexander Galin, to be seen at 7 P.M. on Friday, and \\"Kafka: Father and Son\\" by Mark Roskovsky, scheduled at 9:30 P.M. on Friday and 8 P.M. on Saturday. All performances are in the Goodwin Theater on campus.    Panelists will discuss \\"Contemporary Theater in the Soviet Union\\" at 1:15 P.M. on Saturday, followed at 3:15 by \\"Soviet-American Theater Exchange.\\" Participants will include Mr. Galin and Mr. Roskovsky; George White, director of the O'Neill Theater in Watertown, where he initiated an exchange program with Russian theaters; Ron Jenkins, organizer of exchanges between Emerson College and theaters in Moscow; Leonard Shapiro, who directed \\"Kafka: Father and Son\\" in Moscow last year; Michael Yurieff, a member of the Russian studies faculty at Norwich University, and Catharine Lahti, a member of the modern languages faculty at Trinity and a specialist in Russian theater.    Registration for all events, including readings scheduled throughout the three days and receptions for the playwrights and performers, costs $15. Admission to the panels and readings is free, and tickets for individual performances of the plays are avialable at $6, or $4 for students and the elderly. For more information and a complete schedule, call 297-2209. FESTIVAL OF TREES     The Oliver Wolcott Library in Litchfield celebrates a festival of trees today from 11 A.M. to 4 P.M. but with an extra added attraction -- a tree decorated with 500 bookmarks autographed by 250 celebrities, for sale at $10 to $100. There are two of each bookmark, and a list of them will be available near the roped-off tree, where visitors may make their purchases. The two $100 bookmarks were signed by Leonard Bernstein.    As for the rest, the list is a bit overwhelming. It includes Woody Allen, Isaac Azimov, Melvin Belli, Candice Bergen, Erma Bombeck, Ray Bradbury, Jimmy Doolittle, Gerald Ford, John Kenneth Galbraith, Alexander Haig, James Herriott, Katharine Hepburn, Jim (Catfish) Hunter, Lee Iacocca, P.

It merits inclusion among the screen's most successful invasions of the musical comedy field.Leo Carrillo and Mary Brian head the cast and perform satisfactorily, but the honors belong to Lillian Miles, a comparative newcomer to the screen, and to Roger Pryor, who is making his picture début, although well-known to Broadway playgoers. Both have good singing voices and lend to their rôles a degree of naturalness that is found too seldom in pictures of this type.Its story deals with one George Dwight, a song plugger, who is stranded in a small town, is rescued by a local beauty, Sally, and eventually wins his way to success in New York. Then, after a clash with his producers, he decides to stage his own show. His chief handicap is lack of money, and to complicate things Sally comes to town. The money is contributed by Nick, a gambler (Mr. Carrillo), but he loses control of the show and, for a time, it looks as if the young producer never will be able to ring up the eurtain. But all ends well.The complications are not permitted, however, to impede the action and there are frequent excuses for songs and colorful dance numbers. One of the most effective is \\"I've Gotta Get Up and Go to Work,\\" written by Herman Hupfield, who wrote \\"Let's Turn Out the Lights and Go to Sleep\\" not so long ago. Another good number, sung by Miss Miles, is \\"Are You Makin' Any Money?\\" and Mr. Pryor sings several ballads. All told there are eight songs, written by E. Y. Harburg, Jay Gorney, AI Siegel, Sammy Fain and Mr. Hupfeld.Mr. Carrillo has another of his heavily accented rôles with frequent opportunity for mispronunciations.Other than the billed players, the cast includes Jack Denny and his orchestra","excerpt":"Alexander Gray, Bernice Claire, Mary Lang, Richard Keene and several others known to Broadway.

In fact, Mr. Korda, the Kipling of the kinema, has retaken the already twice-filmed \\"Four Feathers\\" of novelist A. E. W. Mason,—and a fine, stirring, gorgeously Technicolored, explosively cinematic job he has made of it, too. In a week rich in action epics. African locales, and good re-makes, Mr. Korda has managed to plant the British flag higher than all the rest. To \\"Four Feathers,\\" therefore, we herewith tender in grateful acknowledgment a fifth feather—for Mr. Korda's cap.Mad and romantic and bombastically British as the story of \\"Four Feathers\\" undeniably is (it's about a neurotic scion who becomes a sort of Egyptian Lawrence to prove that he isn't a coward) it is also the most splendid spectacle that has happened on the screen this year. Even its plot machinery, usually so painfully creaky in circuses, works well—affording more admissible pretexts for color and action than we ever suspected could exist, even during Kitchener's campaign for the recapture of Khartum. Its strange and lovely backgrounds, inspiredly photographed in the Blue Nile country (including an Egyptian dawn and a flock of sacred ibises) are among those intangible assets of illusion which it is hardly possible to overvalue in a film. And the authenticity of the home backgrounds, Mr. Korda being the adoring Gothophil he is, may be taken for granted.Both when he is functioning on the grand scale, with all of Egypt at his feet, and when his cameras close in for after-dinner port at a country house back home, or for a scene in an officers' mess, Zoltan Korda, the producer's exotically named brother, directs in a way that makes nepotism seem outright attractive.Mr. Sherriff's play likewise is a tight and workmanlike piece of joinery, particularly in its handling of those gently satirical passages involving the priceless C. Aubrey Smith as a repetitious general, with his eternal story of how he, alone, won the Crimean War. And the entire cast, notably including Mr. Smith, has that air of well-bred just-rightness which only a carefully selected native English cast can have in pictures dealing with that curiously foreign race.But \\"Four Feathers,\\" being essentially an eye-filling spectacle, after all, arranges itself finally not into incidents and characters so much as into pleasantly memorable scenes. Most memorable of all, by sheer weight of size and width of camera field, is the beautiful and terrifying charge of the dervishes and \\"Fuzzy-Wuzzies\\" into the muzzles of the immovable British rifles: the wild-haired, spear-waving \\"Fuzzy-Wuzzies\\" especially, Kipling's \\"fust class fightin' men.\\" The strangely tortured British ruling-class ethics which motivate the plot are decently buried (thank goodness) in the picturesque confusion incident to the storming of Omdurman, or scenes like the mad Mahdi's savage extermination of Captain Ralph Richardson's reconnoitering force in the desert.Meanwhile, the continual marching, flag-waving, trumpeting, and regimental parading in the relatively quiet intervals are not aimless exercises merely, but significant and crackling dramatic counterpoint for an imperialist symphony. In spite of all the competition, there's no getting around it: the Capitol has the biggest and best show in town.

(482-0355).    WEDNESDAY When Richard E. Leakey talks about ''Where We Are: Our Past and the Future,'' he knows of what he speaks. After all, he is that Dr. Leakey, a member of the esteemed family of paleoanthropologists, who has added conservationist (he directed Kenya's Wildlife Service) and advocate (he has led the fight to ban the international ivory trade) to his resume, Dr. Leakey appears at 5:30 P.M. at the Staller Center on the Stony Brook campus of the State University, which awarded him an honorary doctorate in May  (632-2787).    At the Libraries    Playing classics from Bach to Bernstein, operatic arias and overtures, Scott Joplin rags and ethnic medleys, the woodwind quintet Four Winds and a Horn appears at 2 P.M. today at the Sachem Library on Holbrook Road in Holbrook (588-5024). Meanwhile, in Hicksville, the Manhattan Opera Association performs excerpts from operettas and songs from the American musical theater today at 2 P.M. at the library on Jerusalem Avenue (931-1417).    On Wednesday, Jerome S. Medowar, a judge of the Nassau County Family Court begins a series of eight lectures honoring the memory of the late State Senator Norman J. Levy. The series, titled ''Convivencia,'' will explore Sephardic history: ''the time in Spain when Jews, Christians and Muslims peacefully worked together to create a golden age in medicine, science, literature and art.'' Judge Medawar said. ''This is a theme that reflects Senator Levy's own beliefs that he followed throughout his career.'' The first lecture, ''The Conquest of Visigothic Spain by the Moors and Arabs in 711,'' is at 8 P.M. at the Merrick Library on Merrick Avenue (379-3476).    On Friday, Marilyn Stasio, who reviews crime and mystery novels for The New York Times Book Review, discusses ''Senior Sleuths,'' like Agatha Christie's Jane Marple and M. C. Beaton's Agatha Raisin, at 1 P.M. at the Rockville Centre Library on North Village Avenue (766-6257), and Dottie Burman, a cabaret performer, will present her musical revue, ''I'm in Love With My Computer: The Songs of Dottie Burman, Romantic and Otherwise!'' at 8 P.M. at the East Meadow Library on Front Street (794-2570).    Saluting Youth    Laura Puttlitz, a senior at Great Neck South High School, has played before the President and Hillary Rodham Clinton, Pope John Paul II, Gov. George E. Pataki and New York City Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani in a 30-member violin ensemble that tours the world, and practice has taken her to Carnegie Hall. But today, when she appears at the United States Merchant Marine Academy's Ackerman Auditorium in Kings Point, it will be ''a dream come true,'' she said. She will make her solo debut with the Great Neck Philharmonic, and that, she said, is ''what I've been waiting for.''    A veteran of the Tarumi Violinists, a metropolitan New York-based group of musicians from preschool through pre-college age who all study with Yukado Tarumi, Ms. Puttlitz, 17, began her lessons when she was 2. While she has matured into the group's first violinist, this is the first time she has soloed with an orchestra. She is to perform ''Autumn'' from Vivaldi's ''Four Seasons'' during the philharmonic's ''Salute to Youth'' concert, featuring the Tarumi Violinists in a program of music by Bach, Brahms, Jenkins, Mozart and Vivaldi. The program will also be the first time Jeremy Cushman, 7, of Queens has shared the stage with his mother, Elissa, a double bassist with the orchestra (482-4225).    'Partners at 50'    The New York City Ballet is 50 years old, and because the State University is also celebrating its golden anniversary, the two join forces this fall for the ''Partners at 50 Tour'' of four campuses. On Saturday, a company of 45 dancers will appear at the Staller Center on the Stony Brook campus in the first performance by a full City Ballet company in Suffolk. Accompanied by a musical ensemble, the troupe will offer Jerome Robbins's ''Two- and Three-Part Inventions,'' to music by Bach; Ulysses Dove's ''Red Angels,'' with a score by Richard Einhorn; Peter Martins's ''Zakouski'' danced to Prokofiev, Rachmaninoff and Tchaikovsky, and Mr. Martins's ''Jazz,'' with music by Wynton Marsalis (taped, since Mr. Marsalis could not appear in the tour). The performance at 7 P.M. is to be followed by an optional benefit reception with the company  (632-2787).    Theater on Campus    With a month of rehearsals under their belts, thespians at four Long Island campuses take to the stage this week, and who knows? The student actor you see on the Island today may be the star of tomorrow. The lineup at the schools includes a familiar drama, an import from Canada, a little-known comedy and a brand-new children's musical.    The State University at Stony Brook has the tried-and-true in ''Crimes of the Heart,'' Beth Henley's 1981 Pulitzer Prize-winning play exploring the reactions of three sisters in a small Mississippi town to a family crisis. The drama opens on Thursday and will be performed through Oct. 18 in the Staller Center's Theater II (632-7230).    In Brookville, the Post Theater Company opens its 42d season with ''Sled,'' a drama by Judith Thompson, a Canadian playwright. Set in the Canadian North, ''a world of unforgiving isolation and mystical change,'' it looks at male violence and its impact on a community. ''Sled'' opens Friday and runs through Oct. 18 at the Little Theater on the C. W. Post campus in Brookville (299-2356).    Things are decidedly less tense in Garden City, where students at Nassau Community College perform the world premiere of ''Rhinoceros Tap,'' a musical based on the 1996 children's book and compact disk of the same name. Miriam Hertzson, a visiting professor at the college, has written the book for the original songs by Sandra Boynton and Michael Ford. The work opens Friday at the Little Theater and runs through Oct. 18.    At Hofstra University in Hempstead, the new season starts with ''Only You,'' a romantic comedy by Timothy Mason developed in the late 1980's at Circle Rep in Manhattan. It opens at the West End Theater and will be preceded by a free symposium at 11:30 A.M. Wednesday at the Spiegel Theater (463-6644).    Long Island Fair    If it's Columbus Day Weekend, it must be time for the Long Island Fair. The 156th year of the fair, one of the oldest agricultural festivals in the United States, gets under way on Friday and runs through Oct. 18 at the Old Bethpage Village Restoration on Round Swamp Road. Besides the customary elephant and horse-drawn wagon rides; magic and puppet shows; performances of 18th-century music by the Hutchinson Family Singers and the Old Bethpage Brass Band; plowing and cross-cut contests, and competitions in vegetables, flowers, domestic arts and hobbies and livestock and poultry, this year's fair will feature ''The Indian River Olde Time Lumberjack Show,'' starring lumberjacks who have won national and state championships in chopping, ax-throwing and log-rolling; an operating duplicate of the historic Maryland Carousel, and a new Livestock Building. The fair runs from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. each day (572-8401).

(Random House, $25.95.) A completely absorbing portrait of Paul Farmer (MacArthur ''genius'' grant, 1993), a driven, dedicated, rigidly idealistic doctor who commutes between Harvard and Haiti, where he works like mad to relieve the suffering of some of the poorest people on earth.    THE BOUNTY: The True Story of the Mutiny on the Bounty, by Caroline Alexander. (Viking, $27.95.) A vigorous retelling of the Bounty epic that asks why William Bligh was the villain of the story and Fletcher Christian the hero","excerpt":"Alexander's answer is as solid as we are likely to get, since Christian's witness is lost.    STONE GARDEN, by Molly Moynahan. (Morrow, $23.95.) Moynahan's second novel is about grief, but no ordinary grief. Its narrator, Alice McGuire, can be exasperated by commonplace frustrations, but as events turn darker she recoils from conventional sentiment; when her boyfriend is killed in Mexico, she dismisses the irrevocable and takes up arguing about forgiveness and helping prisoners write poetry.    LUCKY GIRLS: Stories, by Nell Freudenberger. (Ecco/HarperCollins, $22.95.) A poised but sharp-toothed first collection of stories about Americans abroad, mostly privileged young women; though they have, or used to have, parents and lovers, their primary loyalties are to their own memories.    SAUL AND PATSY, by Charles Baxter. (Pantheon, $24.) Circumstances, alternately aggravating and ameliorating, seem to be in control of a young married-with-baby couple's life in this quite irreverent novel, which shows throughout a healthy contempt for youth and its sometimes forthright admiration of self.    SPEAKING OF BEAUTY, by Denis Donoghue. (Yale University, $24.95.) A book of practical criticism that is also an enactment of cultural studies, allowing 20th-century literary theorists on board without giving them the wheel; Donoghue, as his title shows, has not abandoned the idea that some things of human making are superior to some other such things.    TIGER IN A TRANCE, by Max Ludington. (Doubleday, $21.95.) This entertaining first novel hits the road with Jason, Ludington's 18-year-old narrator, who joins a troupe of nomads following the Grateful Dead in the fall of 1985, relishing casual hygiene and bootleg tapes, worshiping Jerry Garcia.    MONSTER OF GOD: The Man-Eating Predator in the Jungles of History and the Mind, by David Quammen. (Norton, $26.95.) A fine science writer's account of efforts to preserve large top-of-the-food-chain carnivores like tigers and crocodiles, and a meditation on what life would be like without them.    THE FURIES, by Fernanda Eberstadt. (Knopf, $26.) A formulaic situation -- rich girl loves proletarian, promoter of capitalism falls for a balding, beardy guy in Novosibirsk -- is rescued by Eberstadt's prose, which is fresh and vividly descriptive, and by her observation platform, whence she disapproves from above the takeout-menu lifestyle of 90's Manhattan.

Read a compilation of the critics’ thoughts below. And while you’re at it, get the professional take on many more designers in previous scorecards from this season.  Alexis Mabille | designer: Alexis Mabille | slide show  “The show was more about a feeling than a silhouette or a style — but high fashion is just that evanescent vapor of glamour and romance. You either get it or you don’t — and Mabille catches the elusive perfume of haute couture” (The International Herald Tribune) “Alexis Mabille is a newcomer to the couture scene, at least with his own label. The clothes seesawed from awkward . . . to sophisticated. . . . But Mr. Mabille has the couture juice” (The New York Times) “Now that Michelle Obama has come out so solidly in support of young American designers, it’s only natural to wonder whether Paris has an on-the-rise talent of its own who could be taken up by France’s first lady. One such contender might be Alexis Mabille” (style.com) “Alexis Mabille is one of fashion’s brightest young lights” (WWD)  Anne Valérie Hash | designer: Anne Valérie Hash | slide show  “Anne Valérie Hash isn’t about to let the recession deflect her from pursuing made-to-measure clothes, but she’s being pragmatic about it: ‘I didn’t do a show this season; instead I decided to really focus on what people really ask us for — and that’s wedding dresses and smokings.’ Smart move” (style.com) “calm and collected” (WWD)  Armani Privé | designer: Giorgio Armani | slide show  “The elegant silence of well-judged tailoring and of running water colors was replaced by some wild forays into Chinese emperor drapes and lacquer-hard colors like purple, yellow and red. . . . . Couture needs creative madness — but also clothes as solace in hard times” (The International Herald Tribune) “Armani has always loved Asian aesthetics and he’s been a frequent flier to the East since he extended his empire there half a decade ago, so in many ways he’s just going back over territory he’s explored often before'” (style.com) “the biggest problem was neither the politics of the message nor the absence of the kind of brooding romance that might have hooked us in. Nope. It was those shoulders” (WWD)  Chanel | designer: Karl Lagerfeld | slide show  “orchestrated entirely in white and black, giving a graphic edge to light summer clothes, topped by whimsical paper hats. . . . . It is hard to imagine a more beautifully realized or perfectly judged couture collection” (The International Herald Tribune) “What made the show a rare pleasure was Mr. Lagerfeld’s supreme ability to concentrate on a single idea and find endless ways to express it. He was like a fly that landed on a leaf and surveyed all. But the leaf told him everything” (The New York Times) “An all-white collection sounds like an exercise in clinical minimalism, but it wasn’t.

The couture shows opened in Paris on Monday with ‘Let them eat cake’ delirium in the face of global gloom. Yet the cakes were so delicious, so light, sweet and delicately made, that you could do nothing but smile benignly” (The International Herald Tribune) “Mr. Galliano’s beguiling range of romantic shapes do essentially one thing: they flatter the face and waist” (The New York Times) “Oddly, though, the clothes became lovelier when the collection didn’t stick so literally to the Old Masters — either painterly ones or the founder of the house. . . .  It all seemed simpler, fresher, less stilted. And more like the kind of thing that will actually keep Dior clients dreaming, and, hopefully, spending” (style.com) “Going Dutch. A phrase laced with frugality. . . .

Rather, he is a master deconstructionist who can impose his way on a concept as remarkably as on a piece of cloth” (WWD)  Christian Lacroix | designer: Christian Lacroix | slide show  “Christian Lacroix, in his full-on, fanciful way, also reached a high point” (The International Herald Tribune) “Mr. Lacroix opened with some smart-looking jackets piped and brass-buttoned in military fashion, and there were some luscious colors in his evening chiffons, but the familiar Lacroix spirit wasn’t there” (The New York Times) “Little drummer boys, chichi soubrettes, Belle Époque madames, southern Mediterranean exotics: all these stock Christian Lacroix characters lined up and wound their way around his carpeted runway for spring. In that sense, the collection was much as it always is, though that’s also to say just as laden with layered delights and surprises” (style.com) “lovely though it was, his lineup was just dresses, lacking the sense of passion and otherworldliness that makes his best work transcend fashion and approach art” (WWD)  Elie Saab | designer: Elie Saab | slide show  “It was, of course, evening wear as usual (the world hasn’t changed that much)” (style.com) “the Japonaise numbers showed Saab is broadening his horizons beyond his habitual comfort zone — and succeeding” (WWD)  Givenchy | designer: Riccardo Tisci | slide show  “The Givenchy show was more about a mood than a wardrobe and missed out on the house’s heritage of tailoring. But couture should be about conveying emotion, and Tisci’s clothes trembled with the passion of secret dreams” (The International Herald Tribune) “while some of the looks were appealingly soft, the hand was heavy” (The New York Times) “Tisci’s increasing maturity is edging him in the right direction” (style.com) “The collection Tisci presented Tuesday showed progress and featured some very strong clothes. But it’s a different kind of couture than that which sets the standard” (WWD)  Jean Paul Gaultier | designer: Jean Paul Gaultier | slide show  “ ’V’ for victory. . . . Never has the designer taken his playful Parisian ‘ooh! la la!’ to such a sophisticated level, bringing a sobriety and serenity to his signature tailoring” (The International Herald Tribune) “Haute couture is hardly a license to print money, but that didn’t stop Jean Paul Gaultier from issuing his own currency for spring.” (style.com) “a collection that was often beautiful, even though multiple subplots weakened the core message” (WWD)  Martin Margiela Artisanal | designer: Martin Margiela  “The ultimate economy drive comes from the Maison Martin Margiela, where the Artisanal collection is all about fashionable recycling.
