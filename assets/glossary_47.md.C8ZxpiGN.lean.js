Both articles discuss what has come to be called the pre-embryo, the stage of human development that lasts for approximately two weeks after the union of sperm and ovum.  During this period, argues the Rev. Richard A. McCormick, a leading Catholic moral theologian, the new life does not exhibit the stable and determinate character necessary for considering it a distinct individual, or a person with human rights.

Businesses  are moving to more promising locales, and residents stand firm against tax increases. So the schools crumble, the textbooks fade and the chance for improvement shrinks with each budget cycle.         Louis Panigrosso, the schools superintendent since 1964, thought he had an answer. Based on the 1990 United States Census, Carteret was poor enough to qualify as a special-needs district -- a term invented by the State Supreme Court in 1990 to define school districts with large disadvantaged populations. There are 30 such districts, all of which receive extra money from the state to  help close the gap between their spending levels and those of the 120 wealthiest districts. Mr. Panigrosso was hoping Carteret, a flagging industrial town just off the New Jersey Turnpike, could become the 31st.
