The picture is studded with bright lines, and the fullest advantage is taken of Lady Beulah's ignorance of a bootlegger's argot.Roland Young appears as the harebrained Lord Reginald and Alison Skipworth impersonates the aloof, aristocratic Lady Beulah. The banter between these two, as well as that of other characters, was funny enough to make the ushers chuckle yesterday, even after the picture had been screened four times.Lady Beulah, who boasts that her family has a whole page in Debrett's and that they started, according to her, the custom of having tea in 1601, welcomes the idea of leaving her Sussex home for \\"remote America,\\" where, she contends, they have never even heard of the depression. Needless to say, she and her brother are in reduced circumstances. Sir Reginald precedes his sister to New York, and when she arrives she endeavors to ascertain his whereabouts from a telephone central, without knowing his telephone number or his address.How Lady Beulah eventually discovers him is decidedly humorous. She is indignant on learning that he is virtually running a \\"pub,\\" and when he volunteers that it is a speakeasy, she, thinking that he is adjuring her to talk with less vehemence, declares that she is speaking as easily as her emotions will permit.Lady Beulah decides to run the place without breaking the law. Lord Reginald had named it \\"Twicket on Topping,\\" as his English house was called, but later, after it sells as its strongest drink ginger ale, it becomes known as \\"Boots and Saddles.\\" The bootleggers and their chief, who is referred to as The Colonel, are disgruntled with the speakeasy (so called), because the proprietors are not selling its quota of liquor. Lord Reginald and Lady Beulah are informed that if they do not bow to the wishes of The Colonel they may expect to get \\"the works,\\" an expression which is emphatically mystifying to the English woman. Hearing that only soft drinks are being served in the \\"Boots and Saddles,\\" the head bootlegger gives orders to have ginger ale bottles filled with whisky and charged water and delivered to the place. This, of course, gives the director of the film an opportunity to reveal Lord Reginald and James Garfield, a wealthy American whose son. Dick, is in love with the Englishman's daughter, Cecily, enjoying the unexpected stimulating beverage. In fact they get very tight.Then there is the episode in which Lady Beulah anticipates with pleasure the idea of a raid on the \\"Boots and Saddles,\\" which she says will result in much welcome publicity.The story was written by Nina Wilcox Putnam, and Walter DeLeon and Malcolm Stuart Boylan are responsible for the adaptation. The picture was directed by Norman McLeod, who has done his task splendidly.It is a joy to see Miss Skipworth and Mr. Young in parts so well suited to their talented acting. Sari Maritza is both attractive and able as Cecily, and Kent Taylor is ingratiating as Dick. George Barbier is splendid as James Garfield. Others who contribute good work to this amusing chronicle are Dewey Robinson as The Colonel, Edgar Norton, this time not in his usual rôle of a butler but as a titled Britisher","excerpt":"Warren Hymer as a bootlegger and Roscoe Karns as the knowledgeful manager of the speakeasy.
