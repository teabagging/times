J. Johnson, two early be-bop stars, have both taken their improvisational styles far from where they started in the late 1940's. But it is surprising where they've arrived. Mr. Moody and Mr. Johnson, who are performing at the Blue Note through tomorrow, have taken radically different paths to radically different destinations.   Mr. Moody opened his first set on Tuesday night with a blues, and everything he knew seemed to pour out. As with other be-bop saxophonists who have continued to progress -- Sonny Rollins, Johnny Griffin and Benny Golson are the obvious examples -- the language he employs allows for kaleidoscopic improvisations, where quotes, tonal manipulations, practice patterns and old lines converge with everything else he has spent a career learning. Mr. Moody's solo on the blues was dreamlike, brimming with overheard conversations, whispers, declarations and a modern esthetic, as much an exercise in memory as it was in emotion.

Written and directed by Mr. Brattin, its title lifted from a ghost story by Edith Wharton, it delivers a Hollywood-ready Victorian plot in an ingeniously homespun package. In the story, the naïve young Grace Fogg, hired companion to the wife of the mysterious Silas Greyfield, arrives at the Greyfield estate on a stormy autumn night. She meets, in succession, a ghost","excerpt":"two weird servants; the strung-out, pill-popping Lady Greyfield; and the seductively predatory Greyfield himself (played by the excellent James Fletcher, above). There follow apparitions of butchered children, hints of unspeakable obsessions and warnings that Grace must never, ever open the doors of certain rooms. And she never does, because the film ends before we get that far, which is fine. What's remarkable here is not the story but the exercise in atmospherics it has inspired and the ingeniously sophisticated way Mr. Brattin has produced it. The film, about 30 minutes, was shot entirely in Participant Inc's small Lower East Side space, with funky sculptural props and painterly sets, all still in place. The script is artful, too: patched-together dialogue from ''The Turn of the Screw,'' ''The Wizard of Oz'' and ''Bambi.'' The result is a drama of cues and clues, not conclusions, the kind of self-spooking vision an imaginative, bookish kid might cook up in the cellar of his parents' house. It's a vision laced with budding adult passions and fears. Like life, ''The Triumph of Night'' is an innocence-and-experience tale, destined to be forever continued.

And in her starkly delineated drama \\"Keely and Du,\\" at the Hartford Stage Company, the pseudonymous playwright Jane Martin dramatizes the debate in a way that fixes her characters irretrievably on opposite sides of an ideological chasm.   Accordingly, the play, which has garnered considerable attention since its premiere at the Actors Theater of Louisville, Ky., in March, unfolds as a point-counterpoint presentation of irreconcilable points of view. There are lightning flashes of eloquence but, in spite of a truly shocking denouement, surprisingly few moments of dramatic urgency in this story of a young pregnant woman who is kidnapped from a clinic by members of a militant anti-abortion organization. Unlike David Mamet's similarly structured and comparably politically weighted \\"Oleanna,\\" which deals with sexual harassment, \\"Keely and Du\\" never finds a fierce, propulsive dynamic in its dialogue.

As a film it is much the same type of thriller it was on the stage and while some of its links are rusty and worn they still hold well enough together to sustain the interest of this tussle between innocence and wickedness. It is true that the characters often behave as if they were under the spell of the director or the author, and therefore, apparently, they do not find it necessary to bother their brains about thinking, except so far as carrying out the action of the plot.Frank Devereaux, played by Rod La Roque, is the symbol of evil, and Ann Carter, impersonated by Barbara Stanwyck, is the chief exponent of good. Like most rogues in melodramas, Devereaux is a connoisseur of feminine beauty and wine. He has an apartment with a faithful servant who is ready, no matter what the hour, to furnish a supper for his master and his fair victim. In short, Devereaux is not an individual whose death is apt to cause much grief. At a late stage of the story he is mortally wounded by a bullet in a struggle over a revolver, and just before he leaves this old world he does his one good deed.In the opening chapters Mr. Fitzmaurice has the happy idea of showing a floating cabaret \\"twelve miles out.\\" These scenes are depicted with imagination, for there are well-drilled police in speed boats and also police spies on the crowded floating cabaret. There is a waiter who conducts himself like a numbskull, but toward the end of this adventure one learns that this white-aproned menial has his own reasons for behaving stupidly.It is aboard this craft that Devereaux escorts Ann Carter, who is his father's secretary. She resents his attentions in a private dining cabin, and then comes the raid, during which a photographer takes a picture of Ann, Devereaux and a policeman. Deveraux buys the negaive from the photographer, and a year or so later he endeavors to use it to his advantage when Ann, as Mrs. Lawrence Reagan, insists that he cease his attentions to her young sister-in-law.Devereaux is a busy rogue, for he is also accused of flirting with the wife of a friend of Regan's, and it is this little esapade that results in his being mortally shot and in Ann being locked in the room with Devereaux, who at the time is supposed to be dead. And on the door is the sign, \\"Do Not Disturb.\\"In one or two episodes the photography is not all one could wish for, but it does not halt the action. There is the scene where the heroine destroys a photograph while the villain laughs, for he not only has another print but also the negative.William Boyd, the stage actor who did such excellent work as Sergeant Quirt in the original version of \\"What Price Glory,\\" gives a sound performance as Reagan. His characterization is, in fact, more interesting than any of the other players. Miss Stanwyck acquits herself favably as Ann. Betty Bronson lends charm to the rôle of Reagan's sister. Zasu Pitts is capital as a nervous telephone girl. Harry Stubbs makes a dumb waiter interesting. Mr. La Rocque gives an intelligent portrayal of Devereaux so far as the part permits.C. Gardner Sullivan transcribed the play to the screen, and George Scarborough, a playwright, supplied the dialogue.

Ms. Persons has written a logically shaped libretto in which the first act is devoted to the attraction between the comparatively well-off Patience White, who lives with her brother and his wife, and Sarah Dowling, the tomboyish daughter of a nearby farmer. Patience's plan to go west with Sarah crumbles in the face of her family's objections, and in the second act Sarah travels on her own, disguised as a boy. She is hired as an assistant by Parson Daniel Peel, a kindly itinerant bookseller who, believing that Sarah is a boy, confesses to an attraction to her.

(Hoboken Ale is made at the Gold Coast Brewery in Connecticut.) \\n\\nAll the local brands have seen growing sales, a fact that their owners attribute to their products' local appeal, their individuality and a growing public demand for more taste.\\nA Question of Flavor\\n\\n \\"The American beers tend to be very thin and watery, with little flavor,\\" said Michael Miller of Mount Laurel, who started Goldfinch Amber Beer in June. \\"There has been a movement here in the United States to try to get a European taste.\\"\\n\\nGoldfinch, named after the state bird, is the newest of the local brews. Since its introduction, Mr. Miller said, it has stabilized its sales at about 800 cases a month. By comparison, Anheuser-Busch in Newark sold an estimated 11 million cases a month in the greater New York-New Jersey area last year, said Frank McGuire, an Anheuser-Busch spokesman.\\n\\n\\"With the first batch I brewed, I was pleased with the taste,\\" said Mr. Miller, a former financial analyst who now works in the beer business full time.\\n\\nBut he said it took him a little more than a year before he had the final recipe. He said he had made many trips to the brewery in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., to develop the production.\\n\\nBottle caps are being popped all over the state: Jersey Lager hit the market in July 1987","excerpt":"two years ago the New Jersey owners sold the brand to Lion Inc. in Wilkes-Barre, said Lion's chief executive, Bill Smulowitz. Diving Horse Lager Beer, introduced by Michael Gallo of Northfield in May 1990, is also brewed by Lion.\\n\\nSaratoga Lager Beer, partly owned by Chuck Schroeder of Englewood, started distributing its product in New York in October 1991 and came to New Jersey four months later. Though named after the city in northeastern York, the beer is brewed at the Catamount Brewing Company in Vermont.\\nHope to Build Breweries\\n\\n The local beers' owners said they hoped to build breweries in New Jersey. But that would cost $2 million to $6 million, depending on the size, said Mr. Miller, adding that he first wanted to make sure his brand had a big enough market.\\n\\nThe only beer brewery in New Jersey is the Anheuser-Busch plant in Newark, said Nando Avila, assistant to the director of the State Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control. Mr. McGuire said the brewery, which produces the company's national brands, is running at capacity.\\n\\nThe owners of the local beers said they hoped to see brew pubs, where their brews could be both made and sold at retail prices, established in New Jersey.\\n\\n\\"A brew pub is a good way of promoting a product,\\" Mr. Gallo said. \\"People like to see things being made, and they can try it fresh. Then when they try it, they go to the store and buy it if they like it.\\"\\n\\nSuch operations are illegal in New Jersey. But State Senator John Ewing, Republican of Bedminster,introduced a bill in March authorizing the operation of brew pubs in the state. The measure is still in a Senate committee. \\n\\n\\"Tax proceeds generated from that legislation would go to the Alliance to Prevent Alcoholism and Drug Abuse, part of the Governor's Council on Alcoholism,\\" Mr. Avila said.\\nLegal in 40 States\\n\\n Brew pubs are legal in 40 states, including New York and Connecticut, said David Edgar, assistant director of the Institute for Brewing Studies, a division of the Association of Brewers in Colorado. Besides New Jersey, he said, legislation is also being considered in Texas, Hawaii and Michigan.\\n\\n\\"If the brew pub law changes, I would consider opening a brewery here,\\" Mr. Gallo said. \\"It's more profitable, and it attracts tourists.\\"\\n\\nIn 1980 the nation had only 40 breweries, Mr. Edgar said; now there are 340. Of the 1,700 new labels introduced since 1980, he said, about 80 percent of them are local. \\n\\nThe two major selling points of local beers, Mr. Edgar said, are that they are grass-roots operations and that their flavors are fuller than those of the mass-produced brands.\\n\\nOn a recent weekend night in Hoboken, home to more than 100 bars and restaurants, a couple stared into the window of Helmers', a German and American restaurant on Washington Street. About 70 beer bottles lined three shelves behind the glass, among them Hoboken Ale and Saratoga Lager. \\n\\nThe bartender, Richard Lueders, wiped the counter and said Saratoga wasn't a big seller. It needs more promotion, he said. But he added that Hoboken Ale \\"holds its own\\" with the 95 varieties of beer that Helmers' carries.\\n\\n\\"It sells with women or men,\\" Mr. Lueders said. \\"Women, for the most part, don't like heavy beers, while men generally like more full-flavored beers. Hoboken Ale has a perfect balance.\\"\\nGrandmother's Recipe\\n\\n Though Mr. Lueders admitted that some customers were disappointed when they found out that Hoboken Ale is not brewed in New Jersey, he said he sold about half a case a week and did get repeat business for the brand.\\n\\nFive years ago, Mr. Malone said, he found his grandmother's 142-year-old recipe for beer in the attic of his Chatham home. After several years of testing, searching for the right brewer and investing $150,000, he introduced Hoboken Ale.\\n\\nInitially the brand sold 300 cases a month. Now it sells at least 900, Mr. Costine said. \\"We hope to break even by the middle of next year,\\" he said. \\n\\nTheir bottle is transparent brown with a cream-colored label drawn by Mr. Costine, a graphic designer. A red clipper ship called the Hurricane, built in Hoboken in 1851, splashes the top of the label. \\n\\n\\"The crews that rode those type of ships were tough,\\" Mr. Costine said. \\"These guys would go to the bars in Hoboken and recount their stories. This is the same type of ale they drank in those days.\\"\\n\\nThe five local brews differ in taste and appearance. Goldfinch has a purple label and is denser in flavor than Jersey Lager, which is wrapped in a neon-bright label. The Saratoga Lager bottle depicts a horse running across an open field. Diving Horse is trimmed in gold. \\n'Almost Like a Fraternity'\\n\\n The owners say that if one local beer is successful, a customer is more likely to sample other handmade brews. \\n\\n\\"We don't consider ourselves competitive with the others because we each make a different beer,\\" Mr. Schroeder, the Saratoga Lager Beer part owner, said. \\n\\nHis wife, Lyn, added, \\"It's almost like a fraternity.\\" \\n\\nIn his Englewood kitchen, Mr. Schroeder said he was attracted to the beer business after visiting a Detroit brewery in the late 1960's. He said the smell was fresh, like that of cooking.\\n\\n\\"It was a yeast smell,\\" he said. \\"It's difficult to put into words, but I'll never forget it.\\"\\n\\nMr. Schroeder moved to Englewood from New York in 1965. He said he needed more space to house his three motorcycles. While he first considered his New Jersey residence \\"a place to sleep,\\" he said, the state has become his home.\\n\\n\\nSaratoga Lager is the only local brew in New Jersey that is also sold outside the state. Mr. Schroeder said it took four months to move the beer into New Jersey, because \\"we don't have the marketing money.\\" His initial $100,000 investment would have been more, he said, if he didn't own his own advertising company.\\n\\nThe bulk of Mr. Schroeder's product is sold in central New York, including Saratoga County and Albany, he said. Sales have risen to 1,200 cases a month from 800 a month at the start. \\n\\n\\"A lot of men love the idea of being in the beer business,\\" Mr. Schroeder said. \\"They love beer, and they say it looks like it's going to be fun.\\"\\nStories of Diving Horses\\n\\n For Mr. Gallo, an executive of a credit card processing company, getting involved in the beer business seemed natural. He was a bartender when he was in college, he said, and in the late 1980's, when he was manager of transportation for the Trump casinos in Atlantic City, he often heard the stories of the horses and riders who would dive into a 12-foot-deep pool of water on the Steel Pier.\\n\\n\\"The first thing I thought was that it would take me a lot of beer to do that,\\" he said. \\n\\nInspired by the legend, the Diving Horse label features a blond woman in a red bathing suit on horseback over a pool of water. Diving Horse is sold in bottles, as are the other four local beers, but it is the only one also sold on draft.\\n\\nFor now, Mr. Gallo said, he is satisfied with his profits. He invested $100,000 with help from his three brothers to get Diving Horse started, and any money made is put back into the business, he said. Since the beer first hit the market, sales have stabilized at 500 cases per month. \\n\\n\\"When the economy picks up, people will have a little more money to spend on good beer, so we're definitely going to hang in there,\\" Mr. Gallo said. \\"Right now, we're having fun.\\"\\nBeer: Reading All About It\\n\\n IN December 1991, a month after home brewing was legalized in New Jersey, Jack and Laurie Babin were driving home to Bergenfield from an office Christmas party when the couple came up with the idea for a beer lovers' newspaper.\\n\\n\\"I was kind of fed up working for a lot of people,\\" said Mr. Babin, who was employed by a computer company. \\"The home brewing law woke people up. The next thing was that if someone needed information, where could they get it?\\"\\n\\nOn a recent Saturday, Mr. Babin looked at the top half of his newspaper's cover, which featured a drawing of an old-fashioned street filled with saloons. A silhouetted view of the Manhattan skyline shared space on the page.\\n\\nIn the basement his home, several desks were covered with articles pasted to layout sheets, as Mr. Babin and his brother-in-law, Tony Forder, were putting together the third issue of Ale Street News. The newspaper, begun in July, comes out every other month. It focuses on beer and everything a reader might want to know about the beverage, from home brewing tips to reviews.\\n\\n\\n\\"The timing has been perfect,\\" Mr. Babin said. \\"We found the level of interest of hand-crafted beers and home brewing was beginning to come into the New York area, but there was no single source of information.\\"\\n\\nThe paper, which Mr. Babin said was the largest of its kind on the East Coast, is distributed free at pubs, breweries, liquor stores, delis and home brew suppliers.  Ale Street News, Mr. Babib said, has doubled its distribution to 40,000 copies an issue.\\n\\n\\"It has been a definite benefit for the beer connoisseur and the home brewer in finding out new information on beer and the beer industry,\\" said Tom Clark, owner of Red Bank Brewing Supply in Red Bank.\\n\\nUnderneath the newspaper's title, the phrase \\"Your open tap on beer 'hoppenings' in the New York metro area\\" runs across the page.\\n\\nThe December cover featured an article about the founder of the American Home Brewers Association in Colorado. Inside, reviews of beers filled several of the 24 pages. Some of the articles were written by Mr. Forder, who also works for a weekly newspaper in Essex County. \\n\\n\\"We knew there was an interest out there,\\" he said. 5 Local Brews Make Their Debut"},{"year":"1983","title":"A scant two years ago, there was plain popcorn and buttered popcorn and caramel popcorn, and a few slightly more exotic flavors such as cinnamon for those who would dare.

Lane High School in Queens seemed to mind. In this castle of a school building that stands at the edge of a cemetery, there is a bubbling anticipation about what the room down the hall from the principal's office will become next month.   \\"It's going to be a student health center,\\" Miriam Lassalle, a 17-year-old senior, said proudly. \\"It's going to be something positive, something needed around here.\\"   For years, many of the students who attend Lane have suffered an alarming number of illnesses. At times, asthma and diabetes appear almost as common as a winter cough. Violent homes and neighborhoods dispatch scores of students to school with cuts, bruises and an occasional gunshot wound. And some Lane students wrestle with depression, substance abuse and sexual abuse.   On any given day, about 700 of the school's 4,000 students are absent and in need of medical care for \\"acute or chronic illnesses,\\" school officials say.  'Something That Has to Be'     \\"I don't think you can go into a classroom and not find at least one kid who has asthma or sickle cell anemia,\\" said Morton Damesek, the school's principal. \\"And I can't tell you how many kids don't go to doctors. This health center is something that has to be.\\"   As joblessness and despair ripple through America, the ability of many families to pay for adequate health care diminishes, said David Kaplan, chief of adolescent medicine at the University of Colorado School of Medicine in Denver, where there are three school-based health clinics. And the medical needs of teen-agers are often overlooked, he said, because at their age they are expected to be healthy.    In addition to services like free breakfast and lunch programs, schools like Lane are increasingly being called on by educators and medical professionals to provide free treatment for adolescents with physical and emotional problems. Health care has now become part of the trend of schools performing many functions that were once provided by the family.    And health centers placed in public schools and coordinated with health curriculums can teach students the importance of preventive care.    \\"If you are going to reach kids at a time when intervention and prevention may have some impact, then you have to get to them early, and where they are,\\" Dr. Kaplan said. \\"A school-based health center is just an easy way to reach kids and address some of their issues.\\"  Filling a Need     Holly K. Shaw, a registered nurse at Schneider Children's Hospital, a division of Long Island Jewish Medical Center in New Hyde Park, is associate director of the Lane health center project. Ms. Shaw, who specializes in adolescent medicine, said the center was needed because many clinics and doctors' offices are either not in neighborhoods where poor teen-agers live or their office hours do not extend very long after school is out. And adolescents are often reluctant to discuss potentially embarrassing health or emotional problems with parents, she said.    The majority of school-based health centers provide services including physical examinations, weight and drug counseling, treatment of illness and minor injuries and testing for pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases. The Lane school clinic, which will provide all of these services, is scheduled to open Friday.   The first full-service health clinic in an American school was established in Dallas in 1970. By 1984 there were 31","excerpt":"two years later the number had doubled. In early 1990, there were 162 such health centers in 33 states, according to the Center for Population Options, a Washington research and advocacy group that directs much of its work at preventing pregnancy and the spread of sexually transmitted diseases among adolescents.  An Idea That Spread Quickly     School health care dates from the 1890's when health programs were placed in schools to combat the outbreak of infectious diseases often carried by immigrant children living in unsanitary tenements. But not until the 1960's -- long after traveling doctors had been replaced by nurses stationed in schools -- did it become clear that many students were inadequately served. Among other cities to install school-based health clinics, in the 1970's, were Galveston, Tex., and Cambridge, Mass.   The first full-service clinic to also provide family planning counseling services, and the model for most modern school clinics, was established in 1973 in a high school in St. Paul, Minn. The idea spread quickly.    Nationally, about half of the students who use school clinics have no other primary source for health care, said Population Options officials, referring to a study the group concluded in 1988.   In many clinics, the proportion of adolescents without any other health care is almost 100 percent, they said. Adolescents' Problems     Among the reasons are the menace of drug and alcohol abuse and the increasing incidents of violence in America's schools, health care and school administrators said.   \\"There has been a tremendous surge in the last 20 years of the number of these clinics because the need is so great,\\" said John Santelli, Baltimore's director of school health.    Among adolescents, Dr. Santelli said, \\"incidents of homicides are up in the cities, suicides are up in the suburbs and fatal accidents are up across the board.\\"   The job of the lone school nurse, whose post has already been ravaged by a decade of budget cuts in public education, is now challenged by a student body less healthy than it once was.   \\"The problem is so big that no one agency can really meet the need,\\" said Ronald Shenker, chief of adolescent medicine at Schneider Children's Hospital. Dr. Shenker, who is project director of the Lane health center, said school-based clinics were sure to become more common.    Most school health centers are staffed by registered and practical nurses assisted by visiting doctors and dentists. The services are usually paid for by municipal governments and, when possible, by Medicaid and health insurance reimbursements. Local medical centers and hospitals also often provide services.   For instance, the Lane clinic, one of eight being built by the New York City Board of Education, will have an annual operating budget of $250,000 financed by the New York City Department of Health. Medical staff at the clinic will be provided by Schneider Children's Hospital, said a hospital spokesman, and the hospital itself will be available if necessary. A 'Personal Contract'     The movement for school-based health care has not been without detractors. Some parents said they were skeptical of trusting the care of their children to institutions that often have difficulty teaching students to read. Others have been outright suspicious.   For example, dozens of parents in the poor and working-class neighborhoods where Lane High School students live feared the health center would become a source for contraceptives and abortions. They have been assured by school administrators that neither will be the case.    Adele De Maro, who lives in Woodhaven, the neighborhood in which Lane High School is situated, said that at first she was very critical of having a clinic in the school. \\"You couldn't believe how against it I was in the beginning,\\" she said. \\"But now I see it's a great idea.\\"   A crucial part of assuaging parental misgivings about the clinic was done through something that Ms. Shaw calls a \\"personal contract.\\" That, she explained, was a promise that no student would receive non-emergency care at the health center without parental consent. And, she added, \\"there will be no abortions conducted at the health center.\\"   Abortion counseling will be available at the clinic, Ms. Shaw said. At the same time, she said, students will be encouraged to involve their parents in exploring \\"any and all options and alternatives\\" to pregnancy.   \\"You have to establish trust right at the beginning by being absolutely trustworthy,\\" Ms. Shaw said. \\"You have to be beyond reproach.\\"   Maria Thomson, a member of the student health center's community advisory board, said she believed the clinic would be \\"fantastic.\\"   \\"There are young people at Lane, who don't go to doctors, who've never been to a dentist in their lives,\\" she said. \\"My God, the bottom line has to be giving them better health care.\\" Students Come to Class Less Healthy So School Clinics Try to Offer More"},{"year":"1983","title":"In a year-end ''office pool'' published in this space, I offered as a choice for neatest political trick of the coming year ''John Glenn's attempt to keep Democratic power brokers awake as he explains why he is not anti-Israel.''   William Bundy, editor of Foreign Affairs magazine, took umbrage at ''an indirect smear of Senator Glenn'' and demanded to know what positions were taken to rate such obloquy.   It should come as no surprise to Senator Glenn, as he prepares his announcement of candidacy for President, that many American supporters of a strong Israel do not consider him to be among their ranks. Here's why:   On the sale of our most sophisticated fighter-bombers to Saudi Arabia, Senator Glenn has come down squarely on both sides. In 1978, he voted for the Carter Administration's sale of F-15's that caused the Israelis to doubt America's commitment to its safety","excerpt":"two years later, he voted against the Reagan Administration's enhancement of those F-15's and the sale of Awacs.

In the late 1950's, when the young Louis Malle was beginning his filmmaking career, his restless, searching temperament served him well at first: at 23 he was a co-director (with Jacques-Yves Cousteau) of an undersea documentary, ''Silent World'' (1956), which won an Oscar and the Palme d'Or at Cannes","excerpt":"two years later, his first dramatic features -- a tricky thriller called ''Elevator to the Gallows'' and an unabashedly romantic tale of provincial adultery called ''The Lovers'' -- were among the earliest and biggest commercial successes of his generation of French filmmakers, soon to be known as the New Wave. But his curiosity quickly got the better of him: after that promising start, he promptly set about his true life's work, which was to look at the world around him as hard as he could, and to keep his creative identity from becoming too solid, too well defined. ''You see the world much better through the camera,'' he once said, and he wouldn't let anything, even his own personality, block the view.     The Film Society of Lincoln Center's virtually complete retrospective, ''Risks and Reinvention: The Cinema of Louis Malle,'' begins on Friday with a screening of a brand-new, resubtitled print of ''Elevator to the Gallows''; by the time the series is finished, on July 19, not many viewers, I'd guess, will agree with François Truffaut's judgment that ''all of Louis Malle, all his good qualities and faults'' are in that first film.

A child as young as 5 or 6 years old should be able to fly a simple kite, but keep in mind that kites -- especially stunt kites -- can be dangerous if misused. Read directions and safety instructions carefully. Kites made of nylon are the most durable and can last for years, while plastic kites may tear or fall apart after a few flights. The kites below are listed in order of their ease of flying.  Delta wing: A triangular, single-line kite with a keel is the easiest to fly. The keel gives the kite stability, and generally a tail is not needed.  Parafoil: A single-line parachute-style kite is the most portable kite; it has no sticks and can be folded up easily. The wind fills the kite, and it flies.  Diamond: This single-line kite usually requires a tail for balance. Many diamond kites are decoratedwith appliques for children. The kite can be used as a decoration on a child's wall.  Dragon: A single-line kite with a semicircular head and a tail that can range in length from 6 to 50 feet. This kite is fun to fly because of the long tail.  Stunt: The minimum age for flying a stunt kite is 8 to 9 years. This is a two-line kite; it takes 1 to 2 hours to learn how to make it do acrobatics. It can fly at high speeds.  Box/Multicellular: These kites need a lot of wind and close attention to fly. They are not very efficient aerodynamically, and would be difficult for a young child to maneuver.

Photographed in color and sepia by marine combat photographers who accompanied the Second Marine Division when it stormed the island, on Nov. 20, the film recounts in vivid detail and with full measure of the ugly, brutal facts the blistering and bloody two-day battle to wrest the tiny sand strip from the Japs.It opens with scenes of the sea soldiers in their camouflaged suits and fighting gear boarding the transports, then follows with brilliant glimpses of the invasion fleet en route. The terrific four-hour shelling of the island before the attack is suggested in a few shivering \\"pan\\" shots, and then the barges are shown going ashore. The most impressive and gripping scenes in the film, however, are those showing the fighting along the beach and the slow, stubborn, deadly destruction by the marines of the enemy's sand forts.In this phase the film has all the immediacy of personal participation in the fight and its sense of actual combat in close quarters is overpoweringly real. The cameras have caught the tense faces of marines closing in on the foe, the quick action of American snipers, the grim ordeal of dragging the wounded out of the fight. There are also some mute and harrowing sequences showing the devastation, the human wreckage and the dead. When the conquerors file by for the film's finish, the testimony of their appearance is eloquent.Some of the footage in this picture has already been shown in newsreels but the cutting and scoring of it has given it sharper impact here. The film was shot by fifteen marine photographers, two of whom were killed, under the command of Capt. Louis Hayward, former screen actor. It was edited at the Warner Brothers studio, where a simple narration and music track was affixed, and is being released by Universal under the auspices of the War Activities Committee of the motion picture industry.

So far ahead of his time was he that none of his plays were performed for decades after his death. With the possible exception of \\"Danton's Death,\\" Buchner's first play, his work is too rarely seen.

Robert M. Solow, Nobel laureate, Massachusetts Institute of Technology:   The short-run impact of this package is almost certainly contractionary. It almost certainly adds to the 1989 impulse toward recession in the economy. It is very unlikely that the Fed will act fully and quickly enough to offset the contraction. I would not be able in five years to point to anything good from the agreement, the one exception being unless the package should induce the Fed and the world to allow substantially lower real interest rates. The longer-run impact over five to 10 years is probably favorable because then we could get more long-run growth, more investment in social infrastructure, more plant and equipment spending, more spending on research and development and a more skilled labor force.   Isabel V. Sawhill, senior fellow at the Urban Institute:    It will be good for the economy because it will untie Alan Greenspan's hands at the Fed to lower interest rates, and will have positive effects on the financial markets, and long-term rates hopefully will come down. The package buries \\"voodoo economics.\\" Instead of assuming that we have to have low tax rates as a sure-fire tonic for the economy, it recognizes that big deficits are a greater threat than higher taxes. But it doesn't do much to control the growth in spending on the elderly, one of largest and fastest growting components of the budget. Social Security benefits weren't touched. Medicare benefits were only nicked. Medicare and Social Security represent 46 percent of domestic spending and slated to grow to 54 percent by the year 2000. There's also no effort to address the social deficit.   Sar Levitan, director of the Center for Social Policy at George Washington University:    For the short run, I don't think it will have much of an impact, particularly if the Fed follows it up with a mild reduction in interest rates. For the five-year period, it is more fiction than reality, because we can't project for five years from now, particularly since a recession may be looming on the horizon. To a large extent it is just a hope that we will reduce the budget deficit by $490 billion. Also, the projected deficits for the next five years will far exceed the $500 billion reduction that Congress has just voted. In case of recession or economic downturn, every 1 percent increase in unemployment will raise the deficit by another $40 billion. The average increase in each postwar recession was a 2 1/2 percent rise in unemployment. That would mean that if we have an average recession, the Fed budget deficit might actually increase by $100 billion. We don't know yet what will happen to the financial system in a recession.   John H. Makin, director of fiscal policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute:    The economy is weak and getting weaker. It is a modest package of deficit reduction. Everybody is celebrating because we're taking what we can get in these things. The previous largest was $25 billion after the 1987 stock market crash. This is of comparable scale. We are already so close to a recession that it's not worth arguing about. This is a very gentle tap further into a recession.   Alice M. Rivlin, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution:    The good things are: one, that it happened","excerpt":"two, that it's a five-year agreement, and three, that it is real. It is not smoke and mirrors. I also think it's about the right size for now. It's as big as they should have done, given the state of economy, though not enough for the long run. I don't think there will be any impetus for doing more next year, in what looks to be a fairly weak economy. Maybe in two or three years we will have courage to come back and say we have to do more.

Twyla Tharp is inconsistent. She has to be judged piece by piece. As her Winter Garden season currently proves, she is still working things out. In ''The Catherine Wheel,'' she fails grandly with an 80-minute production that is two-thirds bad and one-third terrific. Yet she works to total perfection in an intricate little plotless dance she calls, for no discernible reason, ''Uncle Edgar Dyed His Hair Red.'' In ''Short Stories,'' another premiere, she does more powerfully what she attempts on an elaborate theatrical scale in''The Catherine Wheel.'' And for dessert, she has come up with a bland new version of ''Deuce Coupe'' that is bound to leave unhappy those who remember the 1973 original, but which takes on a strange life of its own.   These contradictions are not new to Miss Tharp, they are merely brought into relief this season. Her talent for putting movement together - as a choreographer - has never been in doubt. What is questionable is the attitude, she imposes on the movement.  Originally, in true 1960's avant-garde style, her public was made to feel ignored just as now it is being overtly wooed. Along the way, she has hectored her audience - as in the current revival of the 1971 ''The Bix Pieces,'' where she restates verbally if childishly her own discovery of other people's ideas.

The idea of a villain banging the hero on the head with a monkey-wrench and then these two being on the same locomotive a few minutes later is stretching things a little too much. There is a sort of poetic rivalry between Jimmy Bradley and a playful cowboy. Mr. Bradley, being in love, writes this ode to the dainty creature:The rose is red, The violet blue, All flowers know That I love you.This rhyme amuses the cowboys (after one of their number has extricated a book with these inspired words from Mr. Bradley's pocket). Mr. Bradley is, incidentally, making a little too free with John Barleycorn and therefore he does not know that the cowboy has slipped back the book into his (Bradley's) pocket with a new verse in place of the one Mr. Bradley had penned to Kate Murphy. These lines from the cowboy read:The rose is red, Your hair is the same, You snubbed nose, Little, Irish dame.It is perhaps natural that Miss Murphy is a little disgruntled, but as she looks intelligent one hopes that she will understand that it was written by some other fool, and not Mr. Bradley.Mr. Bradley does stunts with a freight train that would in everyday life bring about disaster. After being wrecked in one train Mr. Bradley knocks a few men down and then plunges off at mad pace with a freight train. But the President of the road is so pleased with him that when Mr. Bradley asks to have his $4 refunded the high and mighty official hands Mr. Bradley a roll of bills that would handicap a hippopotamus's swallowing capacity.Mr. Bradley is impersonated by William Boyd. The young lady who is in love, then peeved, then in love again with Mr. Bradley is played by Jobyna Ralston. Philo McCullough, who is apparently never surprised at what he is asked to do as the heavy, does rather well as the man with the monkey-wrench.
