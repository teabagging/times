A memoir that examines the author's competing desires to cast off and to embrace his family's refugee legacy","excerpt":"Berger, an editor at The Times, arrived in this country at the age of 5 with his parents, who had spent World War II one step ahead of the Nazis.    THE SHAPE OF THINGS TO COME, by Maud Casey. (Morrow, $24.) All washed up in the big city, the heroine of this comic debut novel retreats to her jerkwater hometown, where, by virtue of landing an extremely odd job, she is privileged to witness at close hand our culture's myriad tacky antidotes to despair.    HONEYMOON: AND other Stories, by Kevin Canty. (Nan A. Talese/Doubleday, $21.) Elliptical, impressionistic short stories, in a style at once tender and telegraphic, featuring characters who do the wrong things for the wrong reasons; for starters, in the first story Godzilla declares his love for Tokyo.    DAZZLER: The Life and Times of Moss Hart, by Steven Bach. (Knopf, $29.95.) A careful, cleareyed account of the life of the playwright, director and actor (1904-61) who collaborated with Broadway's best and pleased many people many times without making large claims for his own significance.    GOATS, by Mark Jude Poirier. (Talk Miramax/Hyperion, $22.) When the hero of this first novel, a 14-year-old straight-A stoner from Tucson, goes east to a fancy prep school, he leaves behind not only his infantile New Age mother but also his surrogate father, a handyman who tends the flatulent bovid ruminants of the title.    CARRY ME ACROSS THE WATER, by Ethan Canin. (Random House, $23.95.) The water is almost certainly the Styx, as contemplated from some small remove by this novel's protagonist, a Pittsburgh beer baron whose protective arrogance is compromised by the eruption, unbidden, of 78 years' worth of memory.    THE ADVERSARY: A True Story of Monstrous Deception, by Emmanuel Carr&#232;re. (Metropolitan/Holt, $22.) Jean-Claude Romand was a pathological impostor, a liar about facts large and small. It was only a matter of time before his family smelled a rat. But he found a way to deal with that problem too.

In the director's interpretation and in Pernilla Ostergren's masterly portrayal, she is not a frivolous child-wife, but a willful woman with a mine of emotional resources. This seemingly revisionist approach to Ibsen's classic does not negate any of Nora's acknowledged traits, but it probes deeply into her psyche.   In every sense, Mr. Bergman's version, which concludes its three-performance run tonight at the Brooklyn Academy of Music's Majestic Theater, makes the play even more relevant to contemporary society. Traditional revivals emphasize Nora's ingenuousness and her husband Torvald's small-minded vindictiveness. In this production, both characters are more complex and unpredictable. The Torvald of Per Mattsson is certainly an egotist, but he is also very much a banker on the rise and someone who is fiercely protective of his image.

The war left the city in ruins, with 80 percent of its housing and public buildings damaged or destroyed. &#8220;Life post&#8208;war East&#8208;West conflict wrenched Berlin in two, the strife culminating in the erection of the Wall, that modern anachronism of barbed wire and concrete, as the dividing line between West Berlin, showcase and Western outpost, and East Berlin, capital of the Communist German Democratic Republic.

From a plot so hackneyed as to be most discouraging, there has been constructed a play which is quite interesting.Presumably resting in the category of melodrama, the picture deals with the two daughters of a strict family. The scene is Heidelberg. As the younger daughter follows the desires of her parents and becomes a dutiful, if unhappy, drudge, the elder runs around at night and eventually lands in trouble. She tries to tell her mother about it, but the latter is \\"too busy\\" to listen, so she steals away. The father, with a change of heart, acknowledges the error of his ways, goes after her and presently all is forgiven.On the face of the bare plot there is nothing at all, but when the little sidelights and touches have been added there can be no lapse of interest. And the last few hundred feet, where the girl stands on a wet pavement in Hamburg and considers her situation, nearly approach genius. She sees the silhouettes of men, the helmets of police officers, then a great, red hand seems to reach down from the tallest building, clenching her. Finally the waters of the river toss before her eyes, seemingly beckoning her in.The attention which has been placed on detail may be seen from the few glimpses there are of a Heidelberg crew. In most moving pictures the oarsmen can't row, and when they approach a wharf the shell looks much like the Mauretania coming to rest. In this picture, however, the men know what they are doing, and when they land they get out and make an end of it.There are, of course, several silly moments in the play where even the camera and the acting cannot do quite enough rescue work to smooth things over.

Like so many other French pictures in which children are involved, it has an innocence and naturalness about it that balance some minor script faults.The idea is that Papa, played winningly by Yves Montand, has arranged to entertain Junior (Yves Noel) on the momentous day—get him out from under the feet of the midwife—by taking him to a soccer game. They are working-class people and the baby is to be delivered at home.But, en route to the game, Papa falls in with a suspiciously sporty old pal who lures him to a gambling casino, near the Etoile in Paris, and gets him to riding the roulette wheel while Junior is made to wait outside. Naturally, the joint is raided and Papa is hauled off to jail, with Junior tagging along after so he can be sent home to fetch Papa's papers.Meanwhile, Mama has had a hard time, and as soon as Junior gets home, brought thither by a cheerful flower-truck driver, played by Aldo Fabrizi, he is sent racing out to call a physician and then an ambulance. The doctor and the hand-wringing midwife have decided that Mama must be got to a hospital. And all the while, Papa is at the police station, going mad amid a lot of tarts and tramps.That is the sort of daffy and haphazard picture it is, with even more incidental froufrou of a workers' May Day festival tossed in. It doesn't hang together very neatly and it gets a bit boring at times, but it pops with bright surprises at odd moments and comes to a heart-warming end.Little Yves Noel is delightful as the bewildered boy who, along with his other distractions, continues to wonder how babies arrive. M. Montand is attractive as the father, showing a nice sense of humor, which is rare","excerpt":"Bernadette Lange is tender as the mother and M. Fabrizi tags along amusingly. Georgette Anys is bouncy as the midwife, and Walter Chiari and Nicole Berger make a cheerful young couple who are not discouraged by the turmoil they behold.Luis Saslavsky directed and helped to write the script, which appears to be the order in which he did it. But the weakness is mainly one of form.Also on the bill at the Baronet is a twenty-seven-minute item called \\"The Kiss,\\" which manifests again that Coney Island is a favorite locale for young filmmakers in New York. It cutely documents the shy encounters of a lonely young bachelor with lonely girls, mostly around Coney Island, until he meets the right one on the parachute-jump. It is amateurish in format and performance, but is well photographed and a good musical score. Everett Chambers directed and John Patrick Hayes produced. Screen: 'Premier May'; Light French Import Opens at Baronet"},{"year":"1950","title":"The British team of Frank Launder and Sidney Gilliat undoubtedly are aware of Eton, its playing fields and the gentlemen and generals it breeds. But being carefree souls, they have chosen to concentrate their talents on Nutbourne, a lesser and presumably fictitious public school where organized pandemonium rather than the molding of youth seems to be the order of the day.For, in \\"The Happiest Days or Your Life,\\" which arrived at the Little Carnegie on Saturday, they have fashioned a witty, warm, sometimes biting and wholly charming commentary on English schools and British bureaucracy under the stress of war. It is not an especially profound joke they're telling, but it is delivered with flavor and professional timing.The whole matter, as has been noted, is pretty simple and can be attributed to the Ministry of Education, which, apparently tripped by its own paper work, has sent St. Swithin's, a girls' school, to be re-settled at Nutbourne, already swarming with its boys and masters.The surprised faculties' problem of accommodating their frisky and delighted charges is merely the beginning, and is notable for the pillow fight it produces. The task of living together is hardly accomplished when a group of the girls' parents descends on an inspection tour of their youngsters' new quarters—to be followed almost immediately by a trio of governors seeking to judge firsthand the work of the headmaster.These disparate and embarrassing tourists, the headmaster and headmistress agree, must be steered clear of each other. That the trick is almost, but not quite turned, is an obvious conclusion.The neat dialogue and the casual, but entirely expert acting all along the route, however, are far from obvious.Wetherby Pond, the headmaster, on first learning of his impending dilemma, is the perfect portrait of a disturbed pedant. Reaching for the phone he insists on informing the Ministry of being \\"guilty of an appalling sexual aberration.\\"The headmistress, guilelessly inspecting her new and apparently untenanted domicile, is equally appalled at the school's motto, \\"Guard Thine Honor,\\" a thought she justifiably deems strange and unnecessary for her girls.Count also as some of the smoothly working parts of this vehicle the intricate plan worked out by the faculties and students for hoodwinking the visitors. The swift changing of gym classes as the groups are led about the school, the rugby team quickly disappearing to be replaced by the girl lacrose players, and the eurhythmic dancers being switched for rugby players make for pleasurable viewing.The principals' performances are in keeping with the hectic goings-on, but their protrayals are far from being merely physical. Margaret Rutherford, an imperious, purposeful headmistress who sweeps into her new domain like a galleon in full sail, is genuinely funny, as is her opposite number, Alastair Sim. As the harassed heads of their schools, their delineations are marked by restraint and a light but sure handling of lines which is a delight.Lending them solid support are Joyce Grenfell, as an elongated sports mistress","excerpt":"Bernadette O'Farrell and John Bentley, who combine love with teaching problems; Edward Rigby, as the school's overworked porter, as well as some of the energetic kids who wholeheartedly get into the spirit of this concocted jape.Education, in short, is a farce at Nutbourne, but it is farce that is enjoyable.

And the opportunity presents itself two times today, when the Clark Botanic Garden in Albertson and the Planting Fields Arboretum in Oyster Bay offer talks intended to stimulate that thought.\\n\\nAt Clark, the annual series of fireside talks begins at 1 P.M. with \\"Sequoias and Seed Farms: Two Glimpses of California's Panoply of Plants\\" by Dr. Howard Irwin, director of the garden on I. U. Willets Road. Before the six-week series, which explores gardens and horticulture worldwide, ends, there will be slide lectures on Walt Disney World, Greek landscapes and French gardens. Tickets and registration: 621-7568.\\n\\nThe American Rhododendron Society also looks abroad today at the Hay Barn at Planting Fields with a look at \\"Plants and Gardens of Japan.\\" Dr. Clifford Desch of the University of Connecticut will do the looking at 2 P.M. There is no charge, just the regular admission of $3 a car. Information: 922-9200. \\n MUSICAL PREMIERE \\n\\n\\nWhen Jonathan Tunick is not busy orchestrating Broadway musicals, he writes his own music. Mr. Tunick's latest work -- for harp, bassoon, trombone and piano -- receives its premiere today in Riverhead at a \\"Piano Plus Concert\\" at the Free Library. Along with classical standards, the new work will be performed by Francesca Corsi, harpist with the New York City Opera Orchestra, and colleagues, James Biddlecome, trombonist","excerpt":"Bernadette Zirkuli, bassoonist, and Robert De Ceunynck, pianist.\\n\\nThe concert is at 2 P.M. at the library, 330 Court Street. Tickets: 727-3228.\\n DR. KING'S BIRTHDAY \\n\\n Although a legal holiday tomorrow, the birthday of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. will be noted at some places that will remain open just to honor the civil rights leader. At the African-American Museum, 110 North Franklin Street in Hempstead, from 2 to 4 P.M. there is \\"A Man With a Vision,\\" with speakers, music, a poetry reading and dramatization and the film \\"From Montgomery to Memphis.\\" The event is free. Information: 485-0470.\\n\\nThe Merrick Library is also showing a film, \\"Glory,\\" the prizewinning drama about the first all-black regiment in the Civil War. It will be shown free at 1 and 7:30 P.M. at the library, 2279 Merrick Avenue. Information: 379-3476. \\n\\nMusic, via a free concert by faculty members and students at the Eastern Suffolk School of Music, figures in the celebration at the Riverhead Free Library, 330 Court Street, at 7:30 P.M. Information: 727-3228. \\n\\nAnd talk, a workshop and discussion on \\"Understanding and Valuing Differences,\\" is on the agenda at the Plainview-Old Bethpage Public Library, 999 Old Country Road. An educator, Dr. M. Vicki Wacksman, will lead the program on working and living side by side with others. It is at 8 P.M. and is free. Information: 938-0077.\\n\\nThe Roslyn Public Schools hold their 10th Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Program at 7:30 P.M. at the high school.

For $1, from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. visitors can tour the \\"Music Halls to Movie Palaces\\" exhibition at the History Museum, see \\"Jews in the American Cinema, 1898-1990\\" in the Art Museum, or study the 60 horse-drawn vehicles in the Carriage House. Information: 751-0066.\\n NEW STUDIO \\n\\n Something new is occurring at the Studio Theater in Lindenhurst. The theater is shifting gears. Instead of one production running a limited number of weeks, two plays will share each week. On Fridays and Saturdays, crowd-pleasers will be performed. The current inhabitant of what is now known as Studio I is \\"Deep Six Holiday,\\" which is billed as a \\"sexy mystery.\\"\\n\\nOn Thursdays and Sundays, Studio II will feature the programming that used to prevail. Starting on Thursday, the first offering will be \\"A Walk in the Woods,\\" a two-character play about Soviet-American arms negotiations.\\n\\nThe Studio Theater is at 141 South Wellwood Avenue. Tickets: 226-1833.\\n WINTER TALES \\n\\n Spinning a yarn or two around the fire is as traditional as theater can be. Although the Heckscher Museum may not have a roaring fireplace, it does have two yarn-spinners. Hence, \\"Tales for a Winter's Eve/Tales for a Winter's Morn,\\" a two-part four-episode series of storytelling concerts for adults organized by the Huntington-based Cartoon Opera. \\n\\nThe series begins on Friday at 8 P.M. when a storyteller, Laura Simms, offers \\"Demeter and Persephone's Mystery Story or, What Goes Down Must Come Up,\\" a performance piece based on the pre-Hellenic myth and female-initiation rite. Complete with brunch, the work will be repeated at 10:30 A.M. on Saturday. On Feb. 8 Derek Burrows will present \\"Island Dreams,\\" folk tales and personal stories about life in his native Bahamas. There is a repeat performance-brunch on Feb. 9.\\n\\nThe Heckscher Museum is on Prime Avenue in Huntington. Tickets: 351-3250.\\nMAPLE SUGARING \\n\\n Tapped any sugaring maples lately? Whether the answer is \\"yes\\" or \\"no,\\" you still might be interested in the sugaring session that the Clark Botanic Garden has scheduled for families on Saturday and next Sunday. The first workshop -- there will be more next month, at places like Connetquot River and Caleb Smith State Parks -- the program shows how to find and tap a tree. The Saturday session is at 3:30 P.M., and the Sunday lesson is at 3. The garden is on I. U. Willets Road in Albertson. Admission information: 621-7568.\\nMOZART EXHIBITION \\n\\n To help set the stage for its conference \\"Mozart: 200 Years of Research and Analysis,\\" which runs Feb. 8 to 10, Hofstra University opens on Saturday an exhibition of letters and musical compositions handwritten by Mozart.\\n\\nOn loan from the Pierpont Morgan Library in New York City, the show includes cadenzas for the \\"Piano Concerto in G, K. 453\\"; one leaf from Mozart's earliest surviving work, and a letter to an acquaintance asking for money.\\n\\nThe exhibition will be on the ninth floor of the Axinn Library on the Hempstead campus and will run through Feb. 11. There is no admission charge. Hours: 560-5669.\\nPHILHARMONIC AT TILLES \\n\\n The New York Philharmonic returns to Long Island on Saturday, and once more it is the Tilles Center that will be host. This time out, the Philharmonic's music director, Zubin Mehta, will be on the podium. With Lorne Munroe, the cellist, as guest. Mr. Mehta will lead works by Kabalevsky and Mendelssohn. The concert includes \\"Eating Living Monkeys,\\" by David Lang, which will receive its New York premiere on Thursday at Avery Fisher Hall.\\n\\nThe concert is at 8 P.M. at the Tilles Center on the C. W. Post campus of Long Island University in Brookville. Tickets: 626-3100.\\nTCHAIKOVSKY ORCHESTRA \\n\\n What's in a name? Nothing if an ensemble that used to be the Soviet Emigre Orchestra, but is now the Tchaikovsky Chamber Orchestra, still plays as sweet. Audiences have a chance to judge the troupe on Saturday, when the 12-member group, founded in 1979 by Lazar Gosman, the violinist, and still under his direction, performs at the Staller Center of SUNY at Stony Brook.\\n\\nThe program includes works by Mozart; Ernest Bloch; Alfred Schnittke, a 20th-century Russian composer who is represented by \\"Moz-Art a la Haydn,\\" a parody, and, of course, Tchaikovsky.

The mayor is alerted, then the prefect, the chief of police, the doctor and the priest. How to deal with the situation? Storm the house? Find a suitably pliant prostitute? Nothing?When \\"By the Blood of Others\\" starts asking questions, the film slowly expires into a series of preconceived attitudes that ultimately have the piety—and something of the dramatic impact—of a public-service clean-air commercial. Is there anyone here who'll stand up for hypocrisy? No? Then for whom is this movie intended?Given what becomes the numbing predictability of Jean Max's screenplay, Mr. Simenon obtains some decent performances, though they are all pretty much defined by how they are required to behave, not by character but by the point of the movie, which, simply put, is that anyone will compromise when his own interests are at stake.The exception to the rule in \\"By the Blood of Others\\" is the Mayor's daughter, a spunky, beautifully tanned young woman played by Mariangela Melato—long before she met Lina Wertmüller—whose bravery and love are quite spectacular and not in the least convincing.The supporting cast includes Yves Beneyton as the mental patient, a young man who looks as if he could be still another son of John Carradine","excerpt":"Bernard Blier as the Mayor; Charles Vanel as the old priest who drinks to forget how terrible his flock is, and Claude Pieplu as the despicably vain prefect. Miss Demongeot's role as the hooker who is brought to the scene is not especially surprising, but it is lively, and when she is removed from the scene the movie goes extremely glum.
