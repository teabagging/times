There is a tendency in our society to look at the problems schools have had at reaching vast numbers of our children and to conclude that traditional teaching methods are outdated. Those traditional methods (most notably the tools of literacy, the book and the classroom itself) have come under attack in recent years by education reformers of many perspectives. The most vocal are those who argue that the book-centered curriculum propagates a white, European ethnocentrism, to the detriment of other ethnic groups, and those who have some personal or monetary interest in mediated teaching.   I counterargue that literacy does not demand adherence to a single cultural point of view. On the contrary, it affords a global perspective on the ideas, beliefs and values of many writers in many societies. Television can deliver images, evoke feelings, even make a student feel good about a subject. But only the word can transmit ideas, and the printed word does so in such a way as can be studied, pored over, questioned and criticized. People who can do these things are called literate, whatever their cultural background.   I suggest that we are being misled by those whose interests in mediated teaching go beyond the purely educational. For example, Whittle Commu nications, during the trial run of its school news program, \\"Channel One,\\" bought full-page advertisements that pointed to the deficiencies of students on leaving school but passed over the obvious explanation: children watch television before they read (thousands and thousands of hours before the first grade), and the electronic curriculum becomes the dominant epistemological influence on their preschool lives. Whittle suggests just the opposite: that students do poorly in school because they don't watch    enough    television!   Tomorrow's leaders, in business and in government, will be literate. They may also know about computers and how to use them, and about television and how to identify distorted messages, but they will be literate first. The child whose educators yield today to the pressures to create an educational environment based on electronically mediated instruction, at the expense of the printed word, will be at a disadvantage tomorrow.   Learn about television, yes. Learn through television, yes. But first learn to read, learn to write, learn to study, learn to criticize, learn to think: learn real literacy. PETER K.
