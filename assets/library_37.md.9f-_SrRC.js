And last week, true to form, it dominated the news -- a public-relations bull's-eye one day, a mind-boggling loss the next. First, refusing to just lick its wounds after a jury held it responsible for a teen-ager's death in a G.M. pickup, the company roared onto the offensive, suing NBC for tampering with a truck in a news report. It scored a direct hit, as NBC -- to settle the suit -- issued a stunningly long (three-and-a-half-minute) on-air apology. Then, with no qualms about kicking the downed network, the auto maker suspended advertising on all NBC News programs. (After just a day, however, saying it was satisfied with the apology, it rescinded that ban.) And to thicken the plot, a judge dealt G.M. a setback in its grand plan to close numerous plants -- and gave at least a temporary reprieve to 2,500 auto workers whose jobs are threatened. Saying that by accepting tax abatements G.M. had effectively promised to keep its Willow Run plant, in Ypsilanti, Mich., open through the 1990's, the judge blocked it from closing the plant. G.M. had planned to close it this summer and consolidate operations in Arlington, Tex. Calling the ruling \\"unprecedented and contrary to both the facts and the law,\\" G.M. said it would appeal. The company had tried to forfeit the tax breaks, but Doug Winters, the Ypsilanti city attorney, said, \\"We want the jobs, not the money. G.M. is not above the law.\\"  Sprinting for the Red  Has Carl Lewis gone into accounting? He must have, the way records are getting broken. But corporate America surely hopes these records will last. First, Ford reported a $7.4 billion loss for 1992, mainly because of its retiree accounting, erasing I.B.M.'s recent record for the nation's largest loss. But its title lasted just a day, as General Motors came in with a stunning $23.5 billion figure. Without the special charges, though, there were signs of improving operations. G.M. stock did well, ending the week at $40.625, while Ford shares slipped to $49.25. A Poorer Sears, a New Sears  Another fixture of the corporate landscape dumped some hefty numbers onto its balance sheet last week. In reporting a $3.9 billion deficit, Sears, Roebuck cited hurricane-related losses at its Allstate Insurance unit and the costs of scrapping its catalogue. Not to mention its charge for retiree benefits -- $1.87 billion. Later in the week, after pausing to let the news sink in, the retailer looked squarely at the future, vowing to spend $4 billion to give its stores face lifts.  More Shrinkage at I.B.M.  It may have to rename itself I.B. if it gets any smaller. I.B.M. only recently said it would cut its work force by 25,000, but word spread last week that it could be more like 40,000. The numbers tell the tale of the incredible shrinking company. Workers: 407,000 in 1986, 300,000 at the end of '92 . . . and 260,000 at the end of '93? Stock price: over $100 last summer, $50.75 on Friday. Short Chapter at Random House  Joni Evans has had a bumpy ride at Random House. In 1987 she was recruited to start her own imprint. Then she was named to head the adult trade division. That lasted just a few years, and she then created Turtle Bay Books. But now Turtle Bay is no more. Ms. Evans said she always thought \\"it would be three to four years before we broke even, and I thought he did, too.\\" But \\"he\\" -- Alberto Vitale, Random House chairman -- said, \\"Conditions have changed.\\" Survival of the Techiest  It makes the head spin. You're slogging through the evening's cable offerings -- the 12 talk shows, the 15 football games -- when some long-distance company calls to explain its convoluted advantages. Now it's all getting mixed up together","excerpt":"the cable and phone businesses are cross-breeding, embarking on an odd Darwinian struggle. Last week, in the first deal of its kind, Southwestern Bell agreed to buy two cable systems from Hauser Communications -- the onset of a race to deliver all manner of communications services, like more cable offerings than you'll ever keep track of. Soon, perhaps, you'll reach for the phone to turn on a movie, or turn on the set to call Aunt Nellie -- or finally, in low-tech despair, sit down and read a book. Hello, Phone -- Get Me Rewrite  Meanwhile, phone technology moves relentlessly on. In Nynex's latest bid to improve the human lot, you can say \\"Mom\\" and the phone calls your mom. And only yours, mind you. Other voices get other moms. In the system Nynex will soon begin testing, each household member compiles a separate voice directory of dozens of names. Is the system perfect? Well, no. Nynex officials concede that if Dana Carvey barked out \\"Barbara,\\" the former First Lady's phone could easily ring. HB>THE ECONOMY   Clinton Works the Crowd  President Clinton laid it out succinctly. \\"With all these economic improvements, we aren't generating new jobs,\\" he said at his \\"town meeting.\\" And the deficit, he said, \\"is about $50 billion a year bigger than I was told.\\" Questioners veered to other topics, but Mr. Clinton kept steering back to the economy. On Wednesday he will propose higher taxes and painful budget cuts, and he wanted to soften up his audience -- to assure them his plan would be \\"fair to all Americans.\\" He did offer one specific: he will seek to raise the corporate tax rate -- a message he then gave to 200 executives and lobbyists at the White House. Read Their Lips: 'Don't Touch'  In casting about for a billion here, a billion there, to hack from the deficit, Mr. Clinton will have to look hard at many sacred items. But some things are more sacred than others -- like Social Security cost-of-living increases. His budget director, Leon Panetta, had proposed a one-year freeze, but Mr. Clinton -- possibly with visions of irate retirees at the White House barricades -- put his machete away. A freeze, falling hardest on the poor, is a far cry from soaking the rich. But he has not ruled out increasing taxes on benefits, since that would not affect low-income people.  Inflation Stays in Check   Inflation is well under control even as economic growth gains momentum. Prices at the wholesale level rose a modest 0.2 percent in January. Over the past year the Producer Price Index has risen just 1.8 percent -- a minor gain for an expanding economy. Detroit vs. Japan: No Contest  Detroit was armed for battle. Thinking the time was right and the new Administration sympathetic, it had spent serious money preparing to file complaints seeking steep duties on imported cars. But once its plans leaked out, the rock-throwing started. Cries of protectionism filled the air, foreign auto makers and governments trained their heavy lobbying guns on Detroit, and even Mickey Kantor, the top American trade official, voiced qualms. The final blow came when General Motors, bombarded by Japanese pressure, defected. The auto makers, while insisting they had a strong case, saw that without a united front they had no chance and backed off. The move was a reprieve for the Administration, which would have been forced to resolve this sticky issue quickly.  INTERNATIONAL   Speed. Freedom. . . . Tolls?   Autobahn. The very word spits out images of untamed horsepower, foot to the Porsche floor, the ultimate open road -- in short, freedom. With no tolls, and long stretches with no speed limits, the network of superhighways has deep resonance for Germany, and the world. But again, yesterday's sacred cow becomes today's hamburger. The realities: severe congestion and a German economy whose horsepower is dwindling. So Bonn plans the unthinkable: charging user fees on the Autobahn and eventually privatizing it. Well, there are still video games. Bonjour, Vietnam  On the first visit by a Western leader since 1975, Francois Mitterrand promised to double aid to Vietnam -- if human rights improve -- and urged Washington to end its economic embargo. Local radio said the visit showed that the West saw Vietnam's \\"will to join the mainstream economy.\\" Tax the Other Guy, Not Saudi Oil  Saudi Arabia is worried. There's a lot of talk about taxes to cut oil use. And now that Saudi Arabia has replaced Russia as the largest oil producer, the Saudis have the most to lose. This threat also comes just as Saudi Arabia is trying to pare OPEC output to push prices higher. So the Saudi oil minister, Hisham M. Nazer, in Houston last week, pulled out all the stops. Citing \\"constant discrimination against oil,\\" he called environmentalists' policies \\"alarming.\\" Oil import fees \\"defy the logic of geology and economics.\\" And, citing the crying need for global economic growth, he said, \\"Abject poverty is indeed the worst environmental pollutant.\\" Business Diary/February 7-12"},{"year":"1991","title":"Cable and Wireless P.L.C., the British-based telecommunications company with a presence in 50 countries, pleased investors earlier this month when it reported pretax profits up 15.5 percent for the fiscal year ended March 31.

'Taking Shape'   Paine Webber Art Gallery  1285 Avenue of the Americas (at 51st Street)  Manhattan  (212) 431-6300  Recommended ages: All ages  Through Sept. 6    The Studio in a School Association's annual spring exhibition of artwork by New York City's public school children is a display of exuberant creativity that sends bolts of color into this staid but elegant mahogany-walled lobby. Working with professional painters, illustrators, printmakers and sculptors, 500 artworks, made by children from kindergarten through high school, demonstrate the infinite skills that can be tapped and developed when artistic abilities are explored.   One side of the gallery shows puppets (including a woman with blue hair), still lifes (Yuen Ling Wong reveals her discovery of Matissean blues), portraits, masks, quilts, landscapes and cityscapes. On the other side are mostly animals. A papier-mache tiger is poised in the middle of a circus hoop of fire. Standing beside it is an unfazed green chicken. Farther down, long-tailed monkeys are juxtaposed on a limb, and dioramas of apartment buildings, houses and skyscrapers suggest a desire for safety and permanence.   For those with children in tow, the gallery is a cool place to visit, with public restrooms and a cafeteria on the second floor, which may be reached by escalator. The gallery is open from 8 A.M. to 6 P.M. on weekdays","excerpt":"the cafeteria closes at 2:30. Children's Sculpture Garden   Cathedral of St. John the Divine  1047 Amsterdam Avenue (at 112th Street)  Manhattan  (212) 662-4481  Recommended ages: All ages    Children don't often get to call a garden their own, especially one with bronze sculptures they can touch. As the children stand around the base of the garden's Peace Fountain, designed by the cathedral's sculptor in residence, Greg Wyatt, and unveiled in 1985, they may take the opportunity to splash themselves and their companions. The fountain rises 40 feet with many powerful figures and images: Michael the Archangel casting out Satan, a DNA-like double helix, rotund faces of the sun and the moon. These are gently balanced by the 120 bronze reliefs and sculptures around the base and the garden's seating area. These small sculptures were made from models designed by children from the New York area (and by a few from Bermuda, Colorado and Europe) who competed in contests over five years. \\"Joe Average and Spot,\\" a sculpture of a leggy man sitting with his sleepy dog, seems to express just what you're supposed to do here: relax with your friends. For 10-year-old Doniell Massey, who lives nearby, the garden is paradise found.  \\"I like the way the sculptures look,\\" he said. \\"Beautiful.\\" The garden is open daily, 7 A.M. to 8 P.M., but the fountain operates round the clock. 'Beavers'   Naturemax Theater  American Museum of Natural History  Central Park West and 77th Street  Manhattan  (212) 769-5650  Recommended ages: 3 and up  Through Jan. 10    In this 30-minute film, beavers keep their cool physically and mentally. When a beaver is chased by a brown bear, it dashes away in the nick of time. When beavers are felling aspens and the slim trees fall in their way, they scoot out just in time. This vivid film, shown on the theater's four-story IMAX screen, was made by Stephen Low, an IMAX film maker, and two Japanese companies. The crew filmed a beaver family above and below the waterline. In one incredible shot, the family huddles in its dry lodge under two feet of ice and frigid water. The beavers' soft but slightly edgy, mournful whines reverberate through the theater.   Filmed in the Canadian Rockies in Alberta, \\"Beavers\\" is more than a strikingly photographed color documentary; it pays homage to these sturdy, pliant, paddle-tailed engineers who conduct their lives with straight and narrow dignity. The film is shown daily at 10:30 and 11:30 A.M. and at 1:30, 3:30 and 4:30 P.M. Admission: $5 for adults and $2.50 for children ages 2 to 12. Strollers are allowed in the theater. Waterfall and Mini-Park   McGraw-Hill Park  1221 West 48th Street  (212) 698-8676  Manhattan  Recommended ages: All ages    When children walk into the short glass tunnel through the waterfall here, they may feel a little uneasy. After all, 3,000 gallons of recycled water is falling every minute, yet nobody gets wet. Once they're out of the tunnel, they can watch the water ripple down green granite walls 20 feet high and feel the temperature around them fall about five degrees. In the summer, the park attracts lunchers (there is an Au Bon Pain concession in the park), and also those seeking a seat in the shade on the garden-style furniture or on the bench under the arbor. The feathery hybrid honey locusts lend a Japanese touch to this midtown spot. In fact, the waterfall is a popular backdrop for wedding pictures, so if you stop by on a Saturday, you might see a bridal party. The park is open from 8 A.M. to 6 P.M. daily.  Public Field   Site 15  Battery Park City  Vesey Street (next to the ferry at North Cove)  Manhattan  Recommended ages: All ages    Despite its unglamorous name, this newly sodded field is actually rather classy. With its face to the Hudson River and its back to the glossy World Financial Center, Site 15 is an unadorned acre that the Battery Park City Authority has transformed into a temporary lawn space. The fenced-in field's proximity to the river makes it a cool spot for casual or organized activities like softball, soccer, kite flying or lazing about. Community Board 1 issues permits for reserved sports and play. For example, preschools can reserve part of the field regularly. Otherwise, take a lawn chair or a blanket to sit on while your children roam about and practice handstands and cartwheels. The field is locked when the sod is soggy after a rainfall, so call ahead to make sure it is open. The field is open 11 A.M. to dusk Monday through Friday and 10 A.M. to dusk on the weekends.

We have, by the time of the assault, come to feel almost as much affection for it as Ada, the heroine, does. Mute since the age of 6, she is lost without it; the instrument is literally her voice. And when, early in the film, the piano is alone on a bare New Zealand beach, the white breakers swelling behind, the water lapping at its legs, its otherworldly beauty seems to protect it from forces that would have left an ordinary parlor piano in soggy, warped dissolution.   To review, for those who have not seen the movie: In the mid-19th century, Ada, in Scotland, is married off to a settler in New Zealand. Left on the beach by coarse boatmen, she and her daughter are met by her husband-to-be, who refuses to have the heavy square piano taken on the long trek through the muddy forest. But a thick-limbed Englishman, another pioneer who combines gentleness with strength, takes an interest in the mute, buttoned-up foreigner. He acquires the piano to \\"study\\" with Ada. He offers her the opportunity to repurchase it, key by key, by allowing him to act out his erotic fantasies as she plays. Ada turns out to be the real student, as her passions are awakened.

Among the legions who have tried over the years to capture its beauty have been the painters Claude Lorrain and Camille Corot, as well as the poet Goethe. Now the American photographer Joel Sternfeld has turned his hand to the task of recording this storied landscape. Mr. Sternfeld recently spent a year in Italy on a Rome Prize fellowship, and during his time there photographed extensively with a large-format camera in the countryside around Rome. This strikingly beautiful show offers the results of his labors, depicting the Campagna in richly colored images made with a sharply observant eye.    Mr. Sternfeld is one of a number of American photographers -- among them Stephen Shore, William Eggleston and John Pfahl -- who came to prominence in the late 1970's with color prints, made using the simplified processes that first became available in that period. Like many of his colleagues, Mr. Sternfeld has long taken the landscape as his primary subject. What he is best known for, though, are the deadpan but deflating touches of humor he includes in many of his pictures. In one, a lovely but insipid vista of tree-covered hills suddenly takes on an ominous, almost Surrealist air when one notices, in the center of the frame, the tiny figure of a circus elephant collapsed from heat exhaustion on a narrow highway.

The 30-second spot is appearing on Time Warner Cable stations in Manhattan. Josh Isay, the consultant who produced the ad, would not say how much it cost","excerpt":"the campaign paid his firm and a related company almost $80,000 in the six-month period that ended in mid-July, according to Board of Elections filings.    PRODUCER -- Knickerbocker SKD.    ON THE SCREEN -- The ad, ''Leading,'' begins with a glowing quotation from Eliot Spitzer, the attorney general and candidate for governor, calling Mr. Morgenthau ''the best prosecutor in the nation.'' There are several scenes of Mr. Morgenthau talking to people, including a couple at the Foley Square courthouse, a black woman with a little girl sitting on a slide, a pair of uniformed police officers, and some young people using computers, who appear to be assistant prosecutors chosen to show the diversity of his staff. The ad also features headlines about his accomplishments from several newspapers and shows him at a desk talking on an old-fashioned-looking beige telephone and standing on the courthouse steps.    THE SCRIPT -- A narrator says: ''He's the nation's leading prosecutor. He's District Attorney Bob Morgenthau. Under Morgenthau's leadership, crime in Manhattan is down to record lows. Murder down 86 percent. Morgenthau cracked down on guns, gangs and drugs. Pioneered the use of DNA to solve rapes. He created special units to stop Internet predators and identity thieves, and to prosecute child abusers. And Morgenthau has led the fight against the death penalty. District Attorney Bob Morgenthau. Experience. Innovation. Democratic values.''    ACCURACY -- Experts disagree about how much credit prosecutors can take for falling crime rates, or how much blame they should take when crime rates rise, as they have during some periods of Mr. Morgenthau's long tenure. His office has been praised for its use of DNA to prosecute cases and for cracking down on members of dangerous drug gangs (many of whom were tried by his opponent in the primary, Leslie Crocker Snyder, a former judge). He has been outspoken in his opposition to the death penalty for more than a decade.    SCORECARD -- This may be the least action-packed political ad this season -- no photos of the candidate marching in a parade, dancing the merengue or even blowing out the candles on his birthday cake (he turned 86 last month). The entire ad appears to have been shot within blocks of his office downtown, and his physical activity is limited to the occasional nod or hand gesture. So the ad may not help him with the little-discussed but major issue in this race, his age. But the list of his office's accomplishments may help refute Ms. Snyder's charge that he has not been innovative in recent years, and the ad reminds the liberal Democrats most likely to turn out for the Sept. 13 primary of his strong stance against the death penalty.

What time of year is best for the trip, and what part of the ship is preferable? Any other suggestions for first-time cruise passengers? - G. J. D., Nutley, N.J.  Answer:Travelers who have sailed on several trans-Panama Canal cruises say that more important than the direction is whether you want to fly out to the ship or fly home. All cruises through the canal are combined with - or require - a flight. For example, on a 15-day cruise in either direction between Fort Lauderdale and Los Angeles, the passenger flies to or from one of those two ports. People who live in Florida often prefer to sail from Los Angeles because then, when they disembark, perhaps carrying souvenirs, they can have someone meet them by car instead of having to get on a plane to go home. There is no significant difference, experienced cruisers say, in going through the locks one way or the other, and in either direction passage takes six to eight hours.

Various other measures also show inflation to be edging down. And that raises the question, should the Government use its powers to push the inflation rate even lower? The consensus, for the moment, is no.    Economists offer three main reasons. First, trying to reduce inflation from its already relatively low level would come at a high cost in more unemployment and recession. Second, inflation is not a problem as long as prices rise each year by the same predictable percentage. When the inflation rate jumps around, the uncertainty about what prices will do next is disruptive.

James Tobin  Nobel laureate and emeritus professor of economics, Yale University    Is there a case for  [ fiscal ]  stimulus to create the jobs we need by 1996? I think there is.    The labor market is weaker than the unemployment rate suggests, for several reasons. Many workers are involuntarily working short time when they would like to be working full time. As everybody knows, we're experiencing an unusual series of layoffs by businesses, permanent layoffs, not temporary cyclical layoffs.    Why can't the Federal Reserve do this job by itself? Well, we heard about the bank credit crunch yesterday and we see that the Fed has more or less given up on doing anything more to stimulate demand, even though it has 300 basis points left between interest rates, short-term interest rates now and zero. I think maybe the Fed did things so late and so little during the recent downturns that they let the economy and business expectations slip away from their grasp.    That's why I think the country needs some fiscal stimulus in the short run. I would be willing to see something like 1 percent of G.D.P. stimulus, which would be about $60 billion a year, and for a couple of years. Other people may prefer a smaller amount.    Now fiscal policy for recovery is bound to raise the deficit temporarily. And we're fooling ourselves if we think there's a way of having a fiscal stimulus that doesn't have that result.    The thing to do, I believe, is to combine the short-run fiscal stimulus with credible deficit reduction policies that will be phased in at a later time, so far as possible enacted, so that they will come into effect at a later time, whether they're tax increases or expenditure reductions.    In today's weak economy, fiscal austerity would be counterproductive and would actually reduce investment in plant and equipment, in technology and human capital for the future. So it actually would damage the prospects of our children and grandchildren, rather than improving them.  Allen Sinai  Chief economist, Boston Company    Short run, a modest dose of net fiscal stimulus probably is necessary to lift growth and jobs as part of the task of raising potential growth in the long run, as well as to sustain a fledgling business expansion. A $20 billion to $30 billion program of short-run fiscal stimulus I believe should be ready to go, legislated as needed in early 1993.    The measures used in this fiscal stimulus I think should . . . do double duty in the sense of being measures that lift short-run growth in jobs but also raise long-run potential output. Candidates . . . include infrastructure spending on roads, highways, buildings, airports, rail and telecommunications and equipment investment tax credits.   Investment tax credits would produce the greatest bang for a buck if they were targeted towards productive equipment, incremental and refundable. Other possibilities: measures such as inflation indexing of capital gains, R.& D. tax credits, education and manpower training programs and incentives for small business.    A major effort should be made to find measures that can raise growth without raising the Federal budget deficit. Some possibilities include an easier bank regulatory environment for bank lending to improve growth at little cost to the budget, a shift in the composition of Treasury financing further away from long-term issues to reduce interest costs of Federal Government financing and greater efficiencies and reduced costs for the provision and delivery of health care services.   On timing, you should do it right away and  [ make it ]  retroactive . . . to early December. I think the impact would be in the second through the fourth quarter of next year when the current impulse of the economy may indeed be fading and so it would come at the right time. If you wait longer, it's dangerous.

Twenty years ago these strange pictures, which usually take the form of glass plates on which murky photographic images marked by an intense illusion of three-dimensional space can be seen, enjoyed a flurry of attention as a medium for making art. A number of major artists -- Bruce Nauman, Yaacov Agam, even Salvador Dali -- tried their hands at making holograms, and a variety of institutions presented exhibitions of the new pictures. But then a pioneering survey of work in the new medium, held at the International Center of Photography in Manhattan in 1975, met with a considerably less than enthusiastic response, and the art world's infatuation with holography soon faded.    Not that it disappeared. The process continues to have important technical and commercial applications, notably the identifying holograms that appear on many credit cards.

You say this would mean savings and improve the quality of life for the mentally ill. This is a simplistic understanding of state psychiatric hospitals, their relation to community services and the nature of mental illness.   I am an attending psychiatrist in the residency training unit at Creedmoor State Psychiatric Center and have been on both the inpatient and outpatient services. While the number of psychiatric patients in state hospitals has declined, this does not take into account \\"revolving-door\\" patients who are stabilized in the hospital, discharged and then require rehospitalization, sometimes several times a year. The units at Creedmoor (especially the acute-care units) are crowded, and there is a constant pressure to discharge patients to keep the numbers manageable. There is a crying need for more doctors and other staff to take care of the patients we have, and a need for more beds and space to accommodate all the patients waiting for admission.   Also, no one wants \\"community\\" residences for psychiatric patients in his or her backyard. Most of the community residences to which Creedmoor discharges its stabilized patients (if they do not live with their families) are on the grounds, and so are Creedmoor's outpatient clinics and day-hospital programs.   This turns out to be convenient because if the patient requires rehospitalization, the Creedmoor safety police can transport the patient to Creedmoor admitting instead of having to send the crisis outreach team outside the grounds. Creedmoor does much more than warehouse patients who would be better served if they were in the community. There is even a crisis residence for patients who are temporarily homeless.   Reductions in the money that is given to Creedmoor would only push more of the mentally ill onto the streets and into the subways of New York. PAUL B.

By and large, the adventures of the farmer-tribesmen (who have left the exhausted soil of their fathers) in the virgin lands of the Kizegi territory are as primitive as the pygmies who inhabit the region.However, in using actual tribesmen and pygmies—they speak English and African dialect—director Cyril Frankel and producer John Grierson have managed to capture the simplicity, fears and superstitions of these basically gentle people. They have caught the tenderness of a pygmy mother who wet-nurses an infant whose young mother has just died of malaria. And they reveal tribal dances, the lushness of a Uganda forest and some of its wildlife without resorting to phony exoticism.But the enactment of the basic story and a rudimentary romance between Jonathan and Violet, the principals, is honest but disturbingly awkward.

This \\"Crowded Paradise\\" shows only a few highlights of a complex picture but it does point an accusing finger at the anachronism of teeming tenements and the underprivileged in the world capital.Since Boris Kaufman, who won an Academy Award for \\"On the Waterfront,\\" was in charge of the cameras here and in Puerto Rico, this independently made production has a documentary quality that gives it realism and impact. And the performances of such local stage folk as Hume Cronyn, Nancy Kelly, Frank Silvera and a pair of newcomers, Mario Alcalde and Enid Rudd, are generally understated but almost always forceful. However, the script fashioned by Arthur Forrest and Marc Connelly wavers between two themes without stressing either appropriately.Their story deals, in the main, with the attempts of Mr. Alcalde, a Puerto, Rican auto mechanic, to get a job here so he can marry Miss Rudd. And it illustrates the hurdles he meets as well as some subtle discrimination. It also treats of Mr. Cronyn's consuming hate of the Puerto Ricans—he's a janitor in a West Side dwelling inhabited largely by them—and his climactic effort to attack Miss Rudd, involve her fiancé in a crime and to break up her wedding. Unfortunately, the screen play does not make too clear why Mr. Cronyn detests Puerto Ricans and the counterpointing of the two themes is not accomplished with originality.Although his role is unrelievedly villainous, Mr. Cronyn brings alive the portrait of the sex-mad drunkard and exconvict overcome by passions and hates. As the wife he blinded in an alcoholic frenzy, Miss Kelly gives full dimensions to the role of a woman charged with detestation of her worthless mate.Mr. Alcalde's portrayal of the tall, dark and handsome youth, confused and then embittered by the big city's hard knocks, is both sensitive and natural. As his lovesick fiancée, Miss Rudd, a petite and pretty brunette, contributes an equally touching and genuine characterization. Mr. Silvera and Marita Reid add brief but solid performances as her doting and protective parents. Fred Pressburger's direction gets them moving swiftly and smoothly after a somewhat lethargic start.Their views of this \\"Crowded Paradise\\" are illuminating and often dramatic, but they rarely penetrate its sleazy façade.

Whatever the real situation may have been in Portland, Ore., an observer cannot help wondering whether it possibly could have borne such a striking resemblance to standard crime melodrama as \\"Portland Expose\\" would have us believe.It is clear from the outset that scenarist Jack DeWitt, producer Lindsley Parsons and the others responsible for this Allied Artists presentation are more devoted to what makes a sensational scene for a routine movie than the facts behind the alleged corruption they purport to expose.Allied Artists, in exploiting this film, has compared it to the studio's \\"The Phenix City Story\\" of two years ago. Since others have invoked the comparison, a reviewer is obliged to say that \\"Portland Expose\\" achieves none of the documentary truth nor dramatic impact of that effective film.\\"Portland Expose\\" is the telling in broadest terms of the tale of the honest tavern-keeper forced to go along with the crime syndicate to protect his family. In vague association with a citizen's group, which incidentally doesn't act as if it could fight its way out of a paper bag, he joins the syndicate long enough to get the evidence the grand jury needs.

It's the Nafta Follies!  It was the television equivalent of historical fiction. The subject was serious, but it had \\"entertainment\\" written all over it. As entertainment it scored: Last week's Gore-Perot \\"chart wars\\" (as a White House aide labeled it) drew the largest audience ever for a scheduled cable program. The subject was the North American Free Trade Agreement, which Ross Perot has gleefully blasted, but kernels of serious debate were hard to spot amid the charts, pictures and what were generously called facts. After the dust cleared, the battle raged hotter than ever for lawmakers' hearts as this week's House vote neared.  Many Mexicans did not take kindly to Mr. Perot's depiction of a destitute country almost totally lacking in customers with enough money to buy American products. \\"Before he opens his mouth,\\" a Mexico City lawyer said, \\"he ought to come down here and take a look.\\" And one newspaper termed Mr. Perot's comments a \\"series of calumnies and lies.\\"  Getting, Spending: A Balancing Act  Lawmakers, by and large, decide how this nation gets and spends. If getting doesn't keep up with spending, it's clear where to point fingers. But many lawmakers are saying, in effect, \\"We can't do it, so make us do it.\\" That's what a balanced-budget amendment comes down to. The idea creates some odd Senate bedfellows -- Paul Simon, liberal stalwart, who favors more getting (taxes), and Orrin Hatch, conservative extraordinaire, who advocates less spending. Cries are getting louder for a vote, but last week, bowing to Thanksgiving, its backers put it off till February.  A Pass Is Just a Pass? No Way! The debate heats up daily: Where, in that vast gray area between leer and lunge, does sexual harassment lie? Several Federal courts have ruled that lawsuits should show workplace harassment so bad that it caused \\"severe psychological injury.\\" Or, in effect, someone can shoot at you as long as you don't get hit. But last week the Supreme Court stepped in and stretched the definition considerably, ruling that harassment that creates a \\"hostile and abusive\\" environment is illegal. \\"The time for strained legal arguments is over,\\" said Marcia Greenberger of the National Women's Law Center. Inflation: It's Gone! It's Back!  Inflation was pronounced dead on Tuesday, but some people swore they saw it wink on Wednesday. First came a report that producer prices, having trended downward most of the year, fell another 0.2 percent in October. That provided reassurance that inflation had been tamed, and interest rates retreated. But then came news that consumer prices rose 0.4 percent, the most in six months. The main culprit was a higher gas tax, clearly a one-time blip, but rates headed up again.  And the economy is stronger, as the numbers keep showing. On Friday came a report that October's retail sales had risen 1.5 percent, the biggest gain in six months. Slowing Down 10-Ton Speeders  Speeding is a big killer on our highways, but it's all relative. A sports car tooling along at 80 is far less lethal than a 10-ton truck. So last week the Transportation Department proposed a ban on radar detectors in trucks over 18,000 pounds. Independent truckers don't like it -- any more than they like the higher diesel prices that spurred last week's protests -- but most other people do, so it will probably happen. Looking Joblessness in the Face  Strong as some economic statistics are, they don't help those who are left behind as this nation goes through wrenching changes and dislocations. And their pain could be seen vividly last week on the streets of Detroit, a city that has had its insides torn out by the icy streamlining of the auto industry. Detroit's jobless -- the city's unemployment rate is 13 percent, twice the national rate -- are so hungry for decent work that thousands of them lined up in the cold dawn for jobs that may never exist. The very iffy jobs were advertised by sponsors of a casino in downtown Detroit to be owned by an Indian tribe in northern Michigan. The casino has slim chances of being approved, underscoring the job-seekers' desperation. But as one applicant said, \\"There's nothing else happening but crime.\\" COMPANIES A Drug Maker Goes to the People  Makers of prescription drugs have long stayed above the consumer fray, their prices untouched by the messiness of the marketplace. But pressures have mounted from all sides, whether it's Hillary Rodham Clinton scolding them for high prices or upstart generics turning the competitive screws. So, as in so much of the health care universe, times are changing. Last week, in a vivid demonstration of this shift, SmithKline Beecham said it would give $10 rebates for a month's supply of Tagamet, its big-selling ulcer drug. The company's patent on Tagamet runs out in May, and a generic version is on the way, so this could be a signal that name brands will try harder to hang onto their market. Instant Rival for Cellular Phones  Wireless communications: two words that define a big slice of our future. But in the flick of an antenna, that future can take on a far different shape, as was proved last week when a relatively obscure company called Nextel Communications agreed to buy a bunch of mobile-radio licenses from Motorola for $1.8 billion in stock. Suddenly everyone looked at the numbers and realized that with the theoretical ability to serve 180 million people nationwide, Nextel had vaulted itself into a force that has to be taken very, very seriously by cellular phone companies. And Nextel, whose shares have quadrupled in a year, has an edge: In addition to voice conversations, it can offer built-in paging and data communications, which most cellular services don't offer. It faces a long, bumpy ride, though","excerpt":"the cellular industry has a huge head start. Going Hog-Wild Over a Chicken  Some elf clearly went around Wall Street whispering \\"rotisserie chicken\\" in eager ears, because last week a lot of investors decided that was the place to put their money. When Boston Chicken, a franchiser, made an initial offering at $20 a share, so many investors scrambled for feathers that when trading opened, the shares more than doubled, ending at $48.50. The shares passed through a lot of hands that day: The offering had just over 2 million shares, but volume was 8.4 million. Investors' ardor cooled by Friday, and the stock slid to $39.75. Paramount Does Its Own Buying  Bored with would-be buyers hammering on its door, Paramount made its own big-money acquisition last week. Paramount, which owns Simon & Schuster, agreed to pay $553 million for Macmillan, to create the world's No. 2 book publisher, after Bertelsmann. And whether it's method or madness, this adds a wrinkle to the Paramount war. The book deal is so big it already raises antitrust flags, but if QVC wins Paramount, the antitrust issue gets even thornier: Advance Publications, owner of Random House, is backing QVC. And let's not forget the latest bulletin on Paramount's dance card: BellSouth has agreed to slip $1.5 billion into QVC's pocket as QVC courts the popular studio. INTERNATIONAL Haiti's Children Pay the Price  When Americans hear of the oil embargo and other sanctions against Haiti, their mental image may well be of Haiti's military rulers holed up in a bunker, isolated by rising international pressure. The reality might be far more cruel. Harvard public health experts said in a study last week that the sanctions are killing as many as 1,000 Haitian children each month. As another, less painful tack, the Administration is trying to get other nations' support for freezing overseas assets of Haiti's leaders. Starving children might prefer that. Disney's French Albatross  The Walt Disney Company is probably wishing it had never tried to translate its magic formula into French. Disney is taking in plenty of money back home, but Euro Disney, clearly the victim of a sorcerer's curse, just drains away the profits. Last week, in fact, Euro Disney -- 49 percent-owned by Disney -- reported a $900 million yearly loss, dragging Disney itself into a quarterly deficit. If it doesn't get fresh cash, Euro Disney said it would face a \\"liquidity problem\\" (that's American for \\"no money\\"). While banks might fear throwing good money after bad, Disney has too much at stake to walk away. Can Japan's Doors Be Opened?  Japan's economy has long been a prime American target. The goods flow out, we say, but tight regulations keep them from flowing in, giving a nasty tilt to the trade balance. Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, three months in office, is determined to hack away at that regulatory wall. Last week a panel he appointed called for easing or ending hundreds of regulations, and even, in a nation built on monopolies, advocated strict application of anti-monopoly laws. So Mr. Hosokawa now has a snazzy bouquet to offer President Clinton when they meet in Seattle this week. But it remains to be seen whether he'll really be able to nudge Japan toward freer markets.

Its wood-poled lodges, imported from neighboring Tibetan villages, sprawl up a steep valley at 10,500 feet, leaving low-altitude guests panting every sumptuous step of the way. A welcome respite from the overwrought glitz of the country's emerging hotel scene, similar resorts are starting to appear throughout China.    THE LOCATION       The valley of Ringha is in southwestern China, sandwiched between Tibet, Myanmar and Sichuan Province. This part of Yunnan Province is predominantly Tibetan. For visitors, that means an unspoiled and enchanting mix of golden-roofed Buddhist monasteries, faded prayer flags and road-clogging yaks.    THE ROOMS       Huge. The rooms are all on two floors. The smallest, a Tibetan Suite, has 2,200 square feet and feels more like a cozy mountaintop chalet than a hotel room. Dark woods and hand-carved paneling are offset with white European-style duvets and extra long pillows. The decorator went a little heavy on red-lacquered furniture, the type you can find in any Chinatown. But the kitsch is kept in check by more traditional touches, like the latticed windows and Tibetan-style quilted curtains. All the rooms have a second-floor terrace that offers sweeping views of the Shu Du Gang River and the snow-capped Hengduan Shan mountains. Furnished with an outdoor daybed, the terrace is a perfect place to watch the occasional villager hauling firewood along the scrub-brush and pine landscape.    THE BATHROOM       Housed in what was once a yak stable, the Asian-themed bathroom was so large that it felt like a private spa. Double sinks, also in red lacquer, occupied one end of the room, while a frosted glass shower and an enclosed toilet occupied the other. In the center, set upon a bed of stones, was a wooden tub that was so big took an hour and a half to fill.    AMENITIES       Each room has high-speed Internet access, satellite television with three English-language channels, a DVD player and a stereo. The Banyan Tree Ringha Spa offers exotic treatments like a 150-minute black sesame rub and Himalayan river stone massage, each about $160 (1,280 yuan at 8 yuan to the dollar). There are also two restaurants: Llamo, downstairs, was disappointing and drab","excerpt":"the Changsa, upstairs, served a delicious Tibetan hot pot of yak and other meats. But all of this pales next to the local tours and trekking excursions available from the hotel's private guide service, including a jeep-based outing to the 700-monk Songzanlin Temple. Tour prices (stated in dollars) are $60 to $200 a person.    ROOM SERVICE       Exceptionally fast, if slightly clumsy. After insisting that I speak Chinese on the phone, a blushing waitress ran to our room, English menu in hand, to take our order. A chicken salad ($10) and tomato soup with prosciutto ($8) arrived 20 minutes later. Lighted votives, incense and cookies are part of the turndown service.    THE CROWD       Well-heeled English, German and Australian tourists, including a number of mixed Caucasian-Asian couples. Everyone seemed to be loyal Banyan Tree fans; after staying at another Banyan resort, they jumped at the opportunity to try this latest one.    THE BOTTOM LINE       There are many kinks to work out, but we could barely bring ourselves to pack up. Rates (stated in dollars), $330 to $900, are a relative bargain compared with the chain's other properties. And unless you're taking the whole family, there's no need to spring for the largest rooms.

Although the war was to follow the old man to Vence -- three bombs fell in his garden -- his stay was extraordinarily productive. One of the fruits of those years was the chapel he designed for the Dominican sisters, who ran a convalescent home across the street from Matisse's home.

The concert was the first of eight performances through Nov. 7.   On albums, Erasure plays electropop songs about love, with the unfettered, unironic emotionality of pure pop. The lyrics are about hedonism, longing and romantic ups and downs; the opening \\"Siren Song\\" urged, \\"Wrap yourself up in every facet of emotion.\\" Mr. Clarke sends counterpoint ricocheting around Mr. Bell's fervent crooning; individual notes -- never chords -- ping and hum and tweet, often bouncing up and down octaves, over a drumbeat that harks back to the disco era.

Judge Wachtler said drug arrests in the city had increased about 50 percent over last year.   The Governor agreed to appoint 40 judges over two years to the State Court of Claims in Albany, which was established in 1897 to hear claims against the state. If the Legislature approves the appointments, the judges will be assigned temporarily to hear felony cases in New York City in State Supreme Court - where the judges are supposed to be elected, according to the state Constitution.

With both feet planted solidly in the ground, its efforts to soar into the thin upper strata of gay nonsense are continually frustrated. The chief difficulty, perhaps, is that the humor of Jack Hulbert and Cicely Courtneidge, who have a reputation as comedians in the tight little isle, is not always easy for American audiences to detect as such. When the humorous intent is obvious, it is very, very obvious, as in the scene where Mr. Hulbert and Miss Courtneidge are in the wax museum with the crooks and are forced to adopt sculptured poses to avoid detection. In this typical excerpt the British producers expend a considerable amount of time on a comedy gag which Hollywood exhausted some years ago.The story is developed in a musical comedy vein","excerpt":"the characters behave according to the urgencies of the musical score; they break into song when the mood seizes them, and will dance up and down a flight of stairs according to their whim. Mr. Hulbert is a brash young policeman who is suspended from the force when he lets a gang of jewel thieves get away from him. To redeem himself he engages in a bit of private sleuthing with the assistance of a Scottish lady of eccentric habits, played by Miss Courtneidge. Winifred Shotter, a charming English girl, is represented in the film as the policeman's heart interest.On the Stage.Donald Novis, who sings as though he had somehow caught a bit of the sun in his voice, is the outstanding entertainer on the stage program, and his fervid manner with some of the popular songs of the day is \\"bringing him encore calls from Roxy audiences.

Somerset Maugham accurately described his plays as ''drama not of action but of conversation,'' a category that could also include plays by, among others, Noel Coward, Frederick Lonsdale and, in America, S. N. Behrman. Each dealt with the domestic infelicities of the rich and the sybaritic. In partial imitation of Restoration comedy, their plays drew sustenance from an expenditure of style. If the dialogue was often less than scintillating, the plays could make an asset of superficiality","excerpt":"the characters satirize themselves by being themselves. Especially with Coward and Behrman, inconsequence could be elevated to wit.   Theatrical time travelers can currently visit two Maughams (''The Circle'' at the Mirror Repertory Company and ''The Constant Wife'' at Equity Library), a Behrman (''The Second Man'' at the Hudson Guild) and a Coward (''Hay Fever'' at the Music Box), all of which were first produced, within a few years of each other, in the 1920's.

The timing of the indictment was bound to create suspicion of a political motive","excerpt":"the charge is now notorious but no trial is possible until after the election. Mr. Merola explains that the five-year statute of limitations was about to expire for key elements of the charge. That may excuse the timing. Whether the charge should have been brought at all depends on the quality of evidence not yet divulged. The Burden in the Donovan Case Despite its length and predictable political importance, the 137-count indictment of Labor Secretary Raymond Donovan and his former business associates discloses little about the alleged crime or, if there was a larceny, whose money was stolen.

That these conventions also feel fresh says something about her facility for adapting them to modern characters of complex sensibilities, beginning with Thanet himself.   \\"Murder victims carried in themselves or in their lives the seeds of their own tragic destiny,\\" Thanet says, as he goes about his inquiries into the murder of the manipulative, overbearing mother of a Member of Parliament. A subtle interviewer with a genius for reading character through his sociable grillings, Thanet represents the best of the old school -- and he is one good reason why his shrewd breed and civilized genre are still flourishing.

Almost every collection had one jacket of a solid tweed with little flecks in it. You know the jacket. Your grandfather had one.   \\"There's a new depression happening right now,\\" the designer John Bartlett said somewhat cheerily. \\"It's not a financial one but an emotional depression, with every friend of mine being on Prozac.

Powell arrived in Bangkok accompanied by Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida on a journey intended to assure the devastated region of American support.   A1    President Bush enlisted his father, former President George H.W. Bush, and former President Bill Clinton to lead an effort to raise money from individuals, corporations and foundations in the United States for disaster relief.   A9    One extraordinary facet of the response to the disaster has been the cooperation between the two sides in Sri Lanka's brutal civil war. The government and rebels have been working together to deliver aid, and large numbers of Sri Lankans appear to be spontaneously reaching across the country's festering ethnic divides to deliver donated food.   A1    In 30 sorties, helicopters from the aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln flew down the Indonesian coast to more than half a dozen towns, delivering water, food, medical personnel and supplies and picking up wounded victims, American military officials said.   A14    The Bush administration said it would pay for its $350 million pledge of tsunami disaster relief from money already in this year's budget, rejecting the idea of asking Congress to approve immediate emergency funds to cover the costs.   A10    Rethinking Training of Iraqis  Gen. George W. Casey Jr., the top commander in Iraq, is reviewing a proposal to add hundreds of American military advisers to work directly with Iraqi units, whose disappointing performance could jeopardize the long-term American exit strategy from Iraq, senior military officials said.   A1    Hours after a wave of bombing attacks in Iraq that left at least 20 people dead, Prime Minister Ayad Allawi called President Bush and discussed the many impediments still facing the country as it heads toward elections in 27 days, according to senior American officials. The officials insisted that Mr. Allawi did not tell Mr. Bush that the elections should be delayed.   A8    Putin Demotes Critical Advisor  President Vladimir V. Putin abruptly reduced the responsibilities of a senior adviser who last week issued a sweeping criticism of the Kremlin's leadership and expressed deep misgivings about the direction in which Russia was headed.   A8    Terror Trial Begins in France  The trial of six men suspected of plotting to bomb the American Embassy in Paris in 2001 opened with tense exchanges between the chief judge and the suspected ringleader.

And he learned it well, so much so that it is easy to see why the maturing composer gradually lost interest in his early Piano Quintet (1904). He performed it and even revised it for a time, but never bothered to have it published. The music, in fact, sounds more like Brahms than like Bartok at times, not altogether surprisingly, since Brahms wrote a seminal work in the form.   The Chilingirian String Quartet closed its concert at Weill Recital Hall on Friday evening with a big, blustery performance of the Bartok quintet, with Panayis Lyras at the piano. Sensibly enough in this broadly Romantic effusion, the players made the most of the work's youthful abandon, not concerning themselves overmuch with slips in pitch or rhythm.

This mystical yarn, the originator or which was Somerset Maugham, frequently makes one think of Svengali and also of that shadow character, Dr. Caligari. Although Mr. Ingram's brilliant work is the predominant feature of this subject, it is nevertheless apparent that he and Mr. Maugham make an excellent team for furnishing screen entertainment.In this new photoplay, Mr. Ingram again shows his genius in bolstering up the interest in scenes by his imagination and his keen attention to detail. The accuracy of the little ideas in this film is enough to make one marvel. One appreciates that a story might be dull and ordinary, but in Mr. Ingram's hands it appears on the screen with subtlety, polish and spark.Except the setting of the Sorcerer's Castle, everything in this picture is exactly as it should be. There are sequences that are so diverting that they make a short story in themselves. Mr. Ingram does not content himself with any makeshift properties so long as the real thing is procurable. He has a hooded cobra in a side-show of a carnival","excerpt":"the chips that are flung on a Monte Carlo gambling table are of mother-of-pearl and square, to denote the higher valuation; the French bank notes are real and so are the French telegrams. In addition to this Mr. Ingram has some scenes of Paris and of a small French town that are used to excellent advantage, and his only mistake is in mixing realism with fantasy in his scenic effects. The castle in which the queer Dr. Haddo engages in his weird operations is a contrast to the other scenes, for it is so obviously the flimsy work of carpenters and plasterers. While its furnaces and scientific paraphernalia do not stir the imagination nor fill one with horror, it answers the purpose of telling the story, and that's all. Possibly a grim old place of real stone would have lent much more of a thrill to this picture.In this production one learns of a fearsome surgeon who believes that the blood of a maiden's heart will bring life to a dead body. He apparently gives no thought as to whether the girl will live, so long as he is successful in his experiment. Hence one must look upon him as mad. Dr. Haddo discovers that he can hypnotize Margaret Dauncy, a sculptress. Before experimenting on her heart's blood, he marries her and then takes her to the gambling rooms at Monte Carlo, where she plays according to his instructions and wins untold thousands of francs. Dr. Arthur Burdon pursues the girl, but he discovers that the hideous surgeon's cunning is at first too much for him.Alice Terry, as Margaret Dauncy, is beautiful and phlegmatic. She is the only American principal in the cast. Ivan Petrovich is emphatically sympathetic and capable in the rôle of Dr. Burdon. Paul Wegener, with good make-up, gives a restrained but thoroughly effective performance as the blood-hunting Dr. Haddo. Firmin Gemier appears in a minor rôle.This is the seventh anniversary of the opening of the Capitol, and Major Edward Bowes is to be congratulated on the distinction of his program in celebrating this event.

You know: jolly music","excerpt":"the chorus dancing on to the stage; a toast to the young squire, bless his heart, and now that he's mah-ster of the old hall naught but happiness shall reign in this village; a kiss for the young mah-ster from the prettiest girl as ever danced on thegreen, the saucy little minx; many a loud huzzah and all is merry and bright. If you are too young, your parents perhaps, and your grandparents certainly, will remember it. The stage got rid of that long ago. But the moving-pictures have discovered it only comparatively recently.They do it a little differently in detail, of course, but the principle is the same. What they do is to have jazz parties, scattered at more or less ???reglar intervals through their pictures, with a set of lady and gentleman cut-ups dashing from one to the next, laughing with great determination and ever and anon breaking out into dances and other symptoms of playful abandon. They also drink. This is all very wild and wicked, and when you see it you may be sure there is dirty work in the offing. One imagines there must be some film factory where they turn this sort of thing out, made by the mile and sold by the foot to directors who require it.There is a good deal of it in \\"The Marriage Whirl,\\" this week's feature at the Mark Strand. There is a good deal of it, as a matter of fact, everywhere. Probably one should not get too much annoyed over it, for a certain percentage of the audience undoubtedly thinks it is what the same percentage would probably call \\"hot stuff.\\" The best thing to do, all things considered, is probably to suffer it in silence, confident that the day will ultimately come when it will go the way the merry villagers of the stage have gone. At the same time, one cannot prevent certain wistful consideration of the excellence of the motto: Eventually, why not now?In \\"The Marriage Whirl\\" they have a better excuse for it than many other pictures, for this one is supposed to show the baneful effects of jazz. There is a husband (Kenneth Harlan) who insists on making a jazz devotee of his wife (Corinne Griffith). Every once in a while when things seem to be going nicely he says, \\"The gang will be here in a minute,\\" and then the same troupe of merry villagers—New York or Paris, it makes no difference—trip blithely on on and do their stunts, and you know our hero has sunk one step lower, and thus much nearer the final ruction that is going to \\"end it all.\\"You know that is what is going to happen, for this is one of those films in which you always know what is going to happen. If you were uncertain at all. you could be sure because of the fact that the true-as-steel childhood lover is hovering in the background. And of all the faithful childhood lovers who hover in the background, give us the ones played by Harrison Ford. He has been doing it so many years by this time that he must be beginning to believe himself it happens regularly in real life. And, quite incidentally, one may feel pleasure that so excellent and modest a young actor as Harrison Ford has been progressing so steadily all these years while hosts of patent-leather haired leading men have come and gone. He has even now reached the movie actors' heaven, a job as leading man in a D. W. Griffith production.In \\"The Marriage Whirl\\" Mr. Ford really does the best acting of any one. Corinne Griffith and Kenneth Harlan are excellent for long stretches of their work, particularly when the lighter emotions are required, but at critical moments they are sometimes a little too conscious of the fact that they are acting and let their features slip into contortions not ordinarily seen outside the precincts of the observation ward at Bellevue or places like that. Mr. Ford does not make that mistake. He probably wouldn't even with greater provocation than he gets in this play. Nita Naldi plays another of her siren parts, and does it so particularly well that one expects her press agent to get busy immediately broadcasting an illustrated article for the movie magazines on \\"Favorite Occupation of Screen Siren is Darning Socks—Nita Naldi in Private Life Is a Perfect Home-Body.\\"When this world gets to be a perfect place we shall no longer have a great idea for the moving pictures turned into a merely satisfactory photoplay. That is what happens in \\"Private Affairs.\\" It has a fine idea in it. An old-style postmaster of the village of Two Forks lets a packet of letters slip down behind his desk and lie there for five years undelivered. When he dies his successor discovers and delivers them. In the five years things have happened and haven't happened because of the non-delivery of those letters.Here is a perfectly valid situation from real life with a touch of novelty about it, and one can imagine how a sensitive and imaginative director and scenarist could have told an intensely human story of the village with that as a background.They have by no means missed it altogether in \\"Private Affairs,\\" however. The film makes an interesting story out of the lives of the folks in Two Forks and is certainly to be commended as an attempt to keep a film story in the realm of real life, where, they tell us, lots of interesting and delightful things happen.What is to be complained about in this picture is that so little imagination is shown as to make the production commonplace at times. A single example of the viewpoint may be instanced in the fact that, for no particular reason at all, a fight is thrust in at the end. \\"When in doubt, give them a fight,\\" is a much-worn adage in the making of pictures. This one is particularly tiresome because there is no reason for it. There has been no conflict between the characters who engage in it. You do not care very much who wins. And then, how the rules of self-respecting heroism are violated! The hastily manufactured hero wins by distracting his rival's attention and flooring him when his head is turned the other way. We insist that is no way for a hero to act.Gladys Hulette is named as the featured player, but what little dramatic action there is centres around another character played by Mildred Harris. Both do well enough with rôles in which the dramatist has not helped them very much. The human values have not been well looked after. The mother, for instance, has mourned over the necessity of leaving her children. When her old-time lover returns, the one whose letter sending for her to marry him was held up five years, and she finds him an impossible \\"dude\\" for whom she would never think of deserting her husband, she does not immediately rush upstairs to the children preparing to \\"stay with their grandmother for a little while\\" when he has left the house, but instead occupies herself with giving a satiric imitation of his dandified manners for the benefit of an empty room.David Butler, as the disillusionizing dandy, and Hardee Kirkland, as the town drunkard, in the gutter five years while a letter notifying him of an inheritance waits undelivered, have the most colorful rôles and do them excellently, even if both indulge in exaggerations allowed by the director. A comedy on the same bill, in which Walter Hiers masquerades as a cook to get into his fiancée's house, provides many laughs.

At least 4 percent of all priests serving from 1950 to 2002 -- 4,392 priests -- were accused of sexually abusing 10,667 children, according to two studies commissioned by the American Catholic bishops. And the studies said the numbers were undoubtedly low because not every abuse victim comes forward. Priests in 95 percent of the 195 diocese were accused of abuse, and in 60 percent of religious orders.

Far and away the most popular form of recreational suicide ever devised, by the late 20th century smoking had become the object of an ethical/medical/legal imbroglio that reached its apogee in 2010, when the precedent set by government bans on smoking was used to forbid fried eggs, going without an overcoat in cold weather, not using sunscreen at the beach and thousands of other human activities alleged to be self-destructive. Narrowly defining the pursuit of happiness, the United States Supreme Court had ruled in Snopes v. Lucky Strike (2007) that happiness by definition excluded any and all activities posing potential dangers to health and safety and awarded Snopes $16 billion in damages. Secretary of Public Safety Ralph Nader (see ''The Cromwell of Connecticut,'' p. 398) interpreted the ruling narrowly and applied it vigorously, ultimately banning the driving of automobiles, aviation, swimming, contact sports and even living in houses -- where statistics showed most fatal accidents occurred -- as risky and thus inimical to the pursuit of happiness. The long-term results were by and large salutary: for example, class-action lawsuits dried up and lawyers vanished overnight and the difficulty of dying spurred such population growth (see ''The Safety-Boomer Generation,'' p. 983) that America's No. 1 export by 2342 was families, leading to the colonization of the moon, Mars and Detroit. The biggest winner of all would, oddly, be France, where the sale of so-called ''smoking visas'' to visitors from the outside world led to an economy so wealthy that, in 2763, France purchased Germany, ushering in an era of European amity and stability that has obtained to this day.

Until recently, criminologists looked for the causes of crime almost entirely in the offenders' social circumstances.\\n\\nThere seemed to be no shortage of circumstances to blame: weakened, chaotic or broken families, ineffective schools, antisocial gangs, racism, poverty, unemployment. Criminologists took seriously, more so than many other students of social behavior, the famous dictum of the French sociologist Emile Durkheim: Social facts must have social explanations. The sociological theory of crime had the unquestioned support of prominent editorialists, commentators, politicians and most thoughtful people.\\n\\nToday, many learned journals and scholarly works draw a different picture. Sociological factors have not been abandoned, but increasingly it is becoming clear to many scholars that crime is the outcome of an interaction between social factors and certain biological factors, particularly for the offenders who, by repeated crimes, have made public places dangerous. The idea is still controversial, but increasingly, to the old question ''Are criminals born or made?'' the answer seems to be: both. The causes of crime lie in a combination of predisposing biological traits channeled by social circumstance into criminal behavior.

Henry's story, \\"The Double-Dyed Deceiver,\\" is on view at the Paramount. It is entitled \\"The Texan,\\" and Gary Cooper, who did capital acting in the film version of \\"The Virginian,\\" again scores as the errant cowpuncher, who, after putting bullets through dusky culprits, makes the error of shooting a blue-blooded young man of his own age from Buenas Tierras and then commits the more heinous offense of stealing a long-legged horse with an arched neck.Most of the credit for the filming of this piece of irony goes to John Cromwell, the director, and Oliver H. P. Garrett, who was responsible for the script.The Llano Kid (Mr. Cooper) steps aboard a schooner for South America with one Thacker, who in the original O. Henry story was an American consul in Buenas Tierras, but who, in the film, is a scoundrel characterizing himself as the agent of Señora Ibarra. He is searching for the Señora's son Enrique, who ran away from home fifteen years before, and on encountering the Llano Kid on a train it occurs to Thacker that the young man could possibly pose as Enrique. The Kid can talk a little Spanish. He is dark and cultivates \\"sideburns.\\"The sequences throughout this production are both suspenseful and amusing. Before sailing for the South the Kid stands in imminent danger of being apprehended by a highly religious blacksmith, whose avocation is being a Sheriff. But the Kid, having a great deal of love for his own life, shows Sheriff Brown a close-up of the big bore of his pistol and as the youngster leaps into the saddle he hears the blacksmith-Sheriff saying, \\"God will deliver you into my hands.\\"Down in the South American port, after having had his hand tattooed with a design similar to that known to have been on the hand of Enrique, the Kid not only finds favor in the eyes of the señora, who firmly believes he is her son, but also with her niece, the charming Consuelo, impersonated by Fay Wray.It had been agreed upon between Thacker and the Kid that the latter is to rob the señora of her treasure and money received for selling cattle and that they are to share in the loot. The Kid, however, is softened by the affection of the woman and the girl and he refuses to carry out the project, with the consequence that Thacker threatens to revenge himself on the imposter.Soon Sheriff Brown appears in Buenas Tierras to take back with him the Llano Kid, who has been \\"delivered into his hands.\\" Brown, however, has a heart and eventually the Kid's courage counts in his favor, with the result that even after the final fade-out he continues to pose as Enrique.The O. Henry twist, which is not told in this review, has been preserved, but here and there one observes characteristic pictorial exaggerations. The love interest is adroitly introduced without hindering the dénouement.The lean, lanky Mr. Cooper elicits a great deal of sympathy as the double-dyed deceiver, so much so that one is quite relieved at the final decision of Sheriff Brown. Oscar Apfel serves the part of Thacker well. James Marcus is splendid as Sheriff Brown, Miss Wray has never been more captivating than she is as Consuelo, a rôle which is agreeably unobtrusive. Emma Dunn is also pleasing as Señora Ibarra.Rudy Vallee and has band are heard and seen in Boris Petroff's stage production, \\"The Blue Mill,\\" before the screening of the picture.

NATO military leaders were expected to finish planning for a peacekeeping force at a meeting in Belgium today.   A1    NATO continued air strikes across Yugoslavia, despite signs that President Slobodan Milosevic might be prepared to negotiate. NATO jets carried out strikes against Yugoslav units that NATO said were trying to repel an offensive by the Kosovo Liberation Army along Kosovo's southwestern border.   A12    NATO air attacks killed at least 16 civilians and wounded 43 when four missiles hit a hospital complex in the town Surdulica. The intensifying air campaign is tied to efforts to get President Milosevic to agree to NATO demands.   A12    Kosovo Update   A13    Tiananmen Inquiry Sought  More than a hundred relatives of people killed when the Chinese army smashed pro-democracy demonstrations in Tiananmen Square in 1989 have petitioned the Government to open a criminal investigation of the officials responsible. This is the first time that the victims' relatives have tried to use China's nascent legal system for redress.   A1    China Assails Espionage Report  China issued its broadest attack yet on the Congressional report that says China stole nuclear and missile technologies, calling the document a tissue of half-truths, conjecture and lies. China's Information Minister said detailed information on American nuclear weapons was readily available from public sites on the Internet.   A6    India Agrees to Peace Talks  Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee agreed to hold talks with Pakistan about the ''warlike situation'' in Kashmir, even as India continued bombing what it called a Pakistani-sponsored band of 700 guerrillas occupying Indian territory.   A6    Kurdish Leader Apologizes  The rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, on the first day of his trial in Turkey on treason charges, apologized for his past and said he would call for an end to guerrilla violence if Turkish authorities would give him the chance to turn his army into a civilian political party. Mr. Ocalan admitted that he and his fighters were responsible for all the killings and other acts attributed to them.   A3    New Appointees in Russia  President Boris N. Yeltsin put Viktor Khristenko, left, and Mikhail Zadornov, two familiar and reform-minded fiscal experts, in top economic posts. Both appointments seemed to have been sought by Mr. Yeltsin's latest Prime Minister, Sergei Stepashin, who has been battling rival political forces to place loyalists in senior Government posts.   A14    World Briefing   A10    NATIONAL   A16-21    U.S. Is Investigating A New Medicare Practice  The Government is examining the growing use of part-time rehabilitation clinics in doctors' offices. The doctors rent office space a few days a week to therapists, who are paid by Medicare to treat patients referred by the doctors. Critics say the practice runs the risk of violating fraud, abuse and kickback laws. But one company that runs such clinics, Senior Health Care, said its arrangements were legal because it paid ''fair market value'' for the space it rented and that doctors were not required to refer patients.   A16    New Type of Cosmic Objects  New surveys of the sky are surprising astronomers with mystifying discoveries in recent weeks, including an entirely new cosmic category of numerous dim, reddish objects that scientists are calling methane brown dwarfs. The discoveries were announced at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society.   A19    Fixing Up the Space Station  Astronauts from the shuttle Discovery repaired a radio, replaced flawed battery packs and installed foam mufflers over noisy fans on the international space station.   A16    Government Net Sites Attacked  Computer hackers vandalized two Government sites on the Internet and left a note threatening to attack more because of an F.B.I. investigation. Last week, hackers disrupted the F.B.I. and Senate sites. The attacks were apparently in retaliation for what the hackers say is F.B.I. harassment of hacker groups.   A20    Egyptian Collection Reopens  The Egyptian gallery of the Oriental Institute in Chicago, featuring a colossal statue of Tutankhamen, opened last weekend for the first time since 1996. The institute's galleries were closed to the public for a $10.1 million renovation primarily to safeguard artifacts from climate damage. The other galleries are to reopen during the next three years.   A20    Instilling Values in School  The nation's public schools, which taught the Bible for generations until the 1960's, are under growing pressure to offer ethics instruction as a way to promote safe learning free of harassment. Educators say the recent school shootings and last week's Supreme Court ruling on sexual harassment by students have given the issue new urgency. School administrators are worried about legal protections, but advocates of public moral education say that though the Supreme Court banned prayer in schools it has never insisted that schools be neutral on values.   A17    Memorial for a Lynching  About 60 people gathered in a white church in Georgia for a Memorial Day service recalling the killings of a black World War II veteran and three relatives in 1946. A Federal grand jury investigation at the time produced no indictments. The case was reopened in 1991, when a witness came forward, but there have been no arrests.   A18    NEW YORK/REGION   B1-10    Lincoln Center May Mount Big Campaign for Overhaul  Officials at Lincoln Center are weighing the possibility of a vast fund-raising campaign to help the performing arts complex, which is approaching its 40th birthday, reverse the effects of decades of wear and tear and address other gnawing problems.

B3    Brooklyn Home for Farm Team  The city is looking at one of its most famous sandlots -- the playing fields at Prospect Park's Parade Grounds -- as a site for a New York Mets farm team until a permanent stadium is built in Coney Island.   B3    SCIENCE TIMES   F1-14    A Key to Good Health  Research is showing that social class -- as measured by income, education and other markers of relative status -- is a powerful predictor of health, more powerful than genetics, exposure to carcinogens, even smoking. In other words, the higher the rung on the socioeconomic ladder, the lower the risk to health.   F1    Stress and Longevity  The ability to handle stress well seems to be a common trait among people in study of centenarians.   F7    Drug Combination for the Heart  Adding a ''super aspirin'' to a standard clot-dissolving drug is a more effective treatment for heart attacks than either drug alone, according to a study being published today.

C1    Korean Bank Sales Delayed  The Financial Supervisory Commission, the financial watchdog charged with cleaning up South Korea's debt-laden financial institutions, said it had extended negotiations over the final terms of the sale of Seoul Bank to HSBC Holdings until June 30.

Now 92 years old, Ms. Bing has lived a remarkably full life. Born and raised in Frankfurt, she studied art history before turning to photography. In 1929, she bought an early model of the Leica, the miniature camera that revolutionized photojournalism in the next decade, and she was soon photographing for Frankfurter Illustrierte and other magazines.   In 1930, Ms. Bing moved to Paris and embarked on an extraordinarily prolific career, working for such legendary magazines as Vu and Arts et Metiers Graphiques, while joining in the heady photographic experiments of the Surrealists and others.

P.S.A.L.  Adams (8-3) at Lincoln (9-0), A Semifinals, 12 P.M.  Key Players: The Adams defenders, led by linebackers Jerry Corollo and Frank LoMonaco, will have to play the game of their lives if they hope to stop the city's best runner, Frankie Sinclair (133 carries for 1,361 yards and 23 touchdowns), and one of the metropolitan area's top quarterbacks, Corey Valentine (32 of 70 for 887 yards, 14 touchdowns). The Railsplitters' defense, paced by linebackers Jeff Miller (58 tackles, 2 sacks) and Mark Navarette (58 tackles), is not too shabby, either, having shut out its opponents six times this season. The defensive unit goes by the nickname G-Men, after the defensive coordinator, Ed Grezinski. The Adams wing-T offense is led by fullback Michael Richardson. Comment: \\"It's a very difficult task to stop all their weapons,\\" said Adams Coach Angelo Palumbo. \\"We just hope that they don't embarrass us.\\" Lehman (8-1) at Canarsie (9-0), A Semifinals, 12 P.M.  Key Players: Although Robert Talley (142 carries for 1,142) is one of the best backs in the city, Lehman can't expect him to run successfully against a Canarsie defense that has allowed only 27 points. Quarterback Willie Nelson (40 of 80 for 375 yards, 2 touchdowns) is going to have to throw the ball downfield to Larry Belton and Kevin Reavis if Lehman expects to score on a defense that has registered five shutouts. Sam Shehadeh (more than 100 tackles, and 7 sacks), Ernest Coakley (12 sacks), Cory Patterson (5 interceptions) and Lance Schulters (4 interceptions, including 2 for touchdowns) are the Chiefs' mainstays on defense. Offensively, Canarsie plays a ball-control offense with Schulters (104 carries for 868 yards, 14 touchdowns) and Eric Smith (130 carries for 1,134 yards, 11 touchdowns), usually wearing the opponents down. Comment: Lehman and Canarsie have met in the semifinals for the last two years, with Lehman winning both games: 24-6 last year and 18-12 in 1991. Fort Hamilton (9-0) vs. Flushing (9-1), B final at Midwood Field, 12 P.M. Key Players: Fort Hamilton Coach Vincent Laino said that the biggest question in this matchup is whether his team can cope with Ashley Thomas's speed. \\"He's just a sensational runner,\\" said Laino of the back, who has rushed for 1,100 yards and 19 touchdowns this season. \\"We're not all that quick defensively. We're more of an attack defense.\\" Fort Hamilton's defensive unit is led by linebacker Jimmy Koutroumanos (100 tackles) and tackle Joe Barbieri, who averages 7 tackles a game. On offense, the Tigers rely on running back Angelo LiCausi. Flushing's defense, which features linebacker Bienbenudo Hernandez (90 tackles), has not allowed a point in 14 quarters. The Red Devils' quarterback, Frank Joaquin, who is a native of the Dominican Republic, speaks little English. \\"It's really amazing,\\" said his coach, Mike Sarachek. \\"We send the play in and somehow he manages to call it right every time.\\" Comment: Fort Hamilton, the P.S.A.L. B defending champion, played its first varsity football game against Flushing in 1991 and defeated the Red Devils, 22-8. Westchester and Rockland North Rockland (11-0) vs. Jamestown (10-2), Class A State Final, 8 P.M., at the Carrier Dome, Syracuse University. Key Players: North Rockland quarterback Jeff Becker has thrown 4 of his 9 scoring strikes to Chris Jackson. The Raiders' rushing attack is sparked by Marcus Larkins (822 yards and 11 touchdowns) and Rasson Wiley, who has rushed for more than 200 yards in each of his last four games. Jamestown, which is located south of Buffalo, has nine players on defense who weigh no more than 170 pounds. Anthony Cusimano, a 5-foot-5-inch, 140-pound defensive end, leads Jamestown's defensive unit, along with tackles Aaron Barnett (6-1, 167) and Jamie Bloomquist, who this past year wrestled at 119 pounds. Bloomquist has since bulked up to 167 pounds. \\"They're like a bunch of rats running to a piece of cheese,\\" said Jamestown Coach Wally Huckno of his undersize defense. Jamestown's offensive stars are quarterback Jim Barlow, who has passed for more than 700 yards, and tailback Jamie Nelson, who has rushed for 1,050 yards. Comment: The North Rockland-Jamestown game is the final game today at the Carrier Dome in the state's first playoff championship. The Class B final pits Chittenango (11-0) vs. Yorktown (10-1), at 5 P.M.","excerpt":"the Class C matches Rye (9-1) vs. Caledonia-Mumford (10-1), at 2 P.M., and the Class D features Tuckahoe (10-0) vs. Clyde-Savannah (11-1), at 11 A.M.

Tareque Masud's expansive fluidity is rapturous, inspired equally by the floating equanimity of Satyajit Ray and the work of the Iranian director Abbas Kiarostami, who deftly uses ritual behavior to provide social commentary. Set in Bangladesh in the 1960's, &quot","excerpt":"The Clay Bird&quot; questions the nature of dedication to Islam. It doesn't attack fealty but eventually rebukes zealotry by showing a boy's reaction to his father's recent total immersion.  Anu (Nurul Islam Bablu) is sent off to a religious school by his father, Kazi (Jayanto Chattopadhyay). Kazi doesn't want his son tainted by the outside world. His obedient though doubtful wife, Ayesha (Rokeya Prachy), quietly expresses through frowns her concern about Kazi's close-minded new seriousness. She gently reasons with her boy, and the bright Anu resigns himself to his new life.  Mr. Masud's sensitivity gives the film a pungent emotional clarity; he recognizes that naïveté isn't a province only of childhood. Kazi's a naïf, too, and learns the hard way that following a path without independent thought is a fool's errand. He's ultimately devastated when he learns of the civil war and Muslims attacking other Muslims: the revolution is coming, and it claims Kazi's way of life. &#151; Elvis Mitchell A Child Copes With Dad's Zealotry"},{"year":"1958","title":"Book The Clay Pigeons of St Lo revd Battered Battalion","excerpt":"THE CLAY PIGEONS OF ST.

Mr. Strand undertook the assignment at the behest of the Leftist Mexican Government, the notion being to produce a series of films illustrating various phases of its national life. This—his first—shows how the class struggle was fought and won (on a minute scale) in the little fishing village of Alvarado on the Gulf of Veracruz.It is not a radical thesis that \\"The Wave\\" expounds, nor is its resolution heroic. With the stolid assistance of an amateur Mexican cast, Mr. Strand makes the point that a group of fishermen who previously had been earning a paltry 7 cents an hour for their labors eventually realize—through struggle and the death of their leader—that their only hope is in standing together and refusing to surrender their catch unless they receive a fair wage.Mr. Strand's photography is explicit and frequently vigorous, but it is a vigor of composition rather than of dramatic action. The telling scenes are those of corded muscles straining at the nets, of broad and rhythmic backs bending to their oars, of captive fish bewilderedly fanning the encircling seines. Descriptively it is good camera work, but it is inadequate to the picture's narrative phases. The fight scene is almost comic opera","excerpt":"the climax, with the fishing fleet united, would be completely unmoving except for Sylvestre Revueltas's score.

This fear was compounded by their view that there was no recourse to any authority, other than the security forces who were so often responsible for the measures inflicted upon them.   They have stated that they feel unsafe even inside their homes, which were frequently subjected to midnight searches, and during which entire households, including children, were beaten. It was said that arrests during such operations were common. A wide range of collective punishments had, they said, become routine during the past three years, such as curfews, the demolition of homes, administrative detention and the uprooting of trees.   A system of arbitrary and heavy taxation had been imposed, which if not complied with, might lead to the confiscation of personal property and even arrest. Furthermore, the Palestinians have complained bitterly about a number of longstanding Israeli practices: the taking of land, especially for Israeili settlements and the privileged access that these settlements were given to water supplies","excerpt":"the closure for prolonged periods of the universities, and the periodic closure of elementary and high schools, which, in the Palestinian view amounted to a denial of their right to education, and the overall economic exploitation of the territories.   Palestinians emphasized that their distrust of the Israeli occupation authorities -- be they the security forces charged with maintaining law and order or officials of the Civil Administration whose role affected most aspects of their daily lives -- had grown so deep that they felt that only an impartial presence, properly mandated by the United Nations, would be able to provide them with a credible sense of protection.   In this connection, many of them drew attention to the military observers stationed in Jerusalem at the headquarters of the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization , and inquired why they could not be assigned to monitor the situation in the occupied territories.   While they expressed appreciation for the humanitarian efforts carried out by representatives of international agencies and voluntary agencies, they were nevertheless deeply frustrated that those organizations were prevented from intervening or unable to intervene more effectively on their behalf. Israeli View of Strife     During the past three years I have had occasion to meet with a number of senior Israeli officials in New York, and have frequently voiced to them my concern about the situation in the occupied territores. In discussions with me, and with members of my staff in the area, the Israeli authorities have maintained that measures such as administrative detentions, curfews and the closure of schools and universities have been carried out in order to restore calm in the territories.   Israel's position has been, and continues to be, that it retains exclusive control over the territories it administers. Furthermore, the Israeli authorities point out that even under the Fourth Geneva Convention it would be for them to maintain law and order in the territories.    According to them, their policy during the past three years has been to put an end to the unrest in the territories which, in their view, is fomented by elements from the outside.   They note that the security forces are adhering to strict regulations determined by the Minister for Defence and that violations of those regulations are punishable. In response to expressions of concern regarding the need for the safety and protection of the Palestinians, the Israeli authorities point out that the many Palestinians who have been killed by other Palestinians should be a matter of equal concern to the international community.    Had it been possible for me to end a mission to the area at the present time, it would have followed up on the discussions begun last summer with the Israeli authorities and the Palestinian leadership. The Israeli authorities indicated at that time that they would be implementing new measures in the territories.    It should be noted that, in the subsequent months, there was a decreased military presence in the occupied territories and a decline in casualties resulting from actions involving the Israeli security forces there. Practical U.N. Steps     Further, there has also been a reopening of certain academic institutions. Nevertheless, the essential facts of the occupation have not changed and the potential for friction and confrontation between Israelis and Palestinians has remained very high, as evidenced by the tragic events of Oct. 8, 1990. The spate of violent attacks that have occurred since then, with more bloodshed on both sides, has generated further mistrust and bitterness.   The issue before us today is what practical steps can, in fact, be taken by the international community to insure the safety and protection of the Palestinian civilians living under Israeli occupation. Clearly, the numerous appeals -- whether by the Security Council, by myself as Secretary General, by individual Member States or by I.C.R.C., which is the custodian of the Geneva Conventions -- to the Israeli authorities to abide by their obligations under the Fourth Geneva Convention have been ineffective.

For a Stakhanoffite to marry a girl who cannot swing a scythe with the rest of them would be tantamount, let us say, to one of our Back Bay lads running off with a taxi dancer. Hence the comic crux of the situation here is a shockworker's erroneous belief that his dream girl has only 100 working days to her credit on the collective farm while she, in turn, gets the impression that her tractor-driving lover thinks he is too good for just an ordinary farm brigade girl.Foreign as the problem is to our still mildly capitalistic view, the Russians have worked it out in accordance with the good old boy-meets-girl formula. The cloudburst holds off long enough to permit the shockworker to bring up his tractor and complete the farm brigade's harvest","excerpt":"the clowning bookkeeper of the kolkhoz confesses to the plot, and the couple pledge anew the honest troth of comrade Stakhanoffites.The whole is presented rather heartily and with the bluff good nature of the chubby Ukrainian peasants, whose humor—like the picture's—must be simple, elementary and broad. While there are some lush shots of the warm wheat fields, of gathering clouds and grunting machines, the film suffers through an inequality and streakiness of light—whether through a faulty print or fault of production. The performances have the naturalness and honesty we have grown to expect of the Soviet films.Also on the Cameo's bill is \\"People of the Cumberland,\\" a propaganda film—rather than a documentary—in behalf of labor unionism. Its commentary by Erskine Caldwell is moderate in tone, but is altogether too loosely connected with the pictorial text. Picnic scenes are not exactly pat to a spoken plea for union organization. It doesn't carry much conviction as propaganda and not much weight as a film. Sorry.
