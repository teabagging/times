It's a male creature with an upper voice constricted in range and quality, just as you might guess even without looking up the term in Cornelius L. Reid's ''A Dictionary of Vocal Terminology.'' But is an ''A-flat tenor'' different from a ''necktie tenor,'' and if so, how? What does it mean to say that a singer is ''chewing bread'' or ''drinking in the tone''? What is the difference between a tone with ''ping'' and one with ''ring''?\\n\\nI have been enjoying myself recently by reading Mr. Reid's discussions of such fascinating questions in his new dictionary, a 478-page volume published by Joseph Patelson Music House (150 West 56th Street, New York, N.Y. 10019) and priced at $39.95. Perhaps the book's chief value, aside from any pleasure or enlightenment it may provide to ordinary music listeners, lies in its attempt to bring order out of the terminological confusion that besets the vocal profession today. Listening to singers and their teachers try to explain their theories you realize what the construction workers on the Tower of Babel must have been up against. The words, having no commonly accepted meanings, become a jumble of sense and nonsense. Teachers often use the same words to mean opposite things: Mr. Reid insists that the phrase ''too far back'' actually refers to a tone that is produced too far forward, because of a constriction high in the pharyngeal tract. In this, as in many similar instances, what a singer or teacher may be feeling and trying to describe may quite different from what is taking place physiologically.

THE LONG HOME. By William Gay. (MacMurray & Beck, $24.95.)

LOSING NELSON. By Barry Unsworth. (Doubleday, $23.95.) A provocative, absorbing novel whose mad hero hides from his own life by his elaborate identification with Admiral Nelson, a folly he understands well enough to labor at the same time to destroy it.    LOUSE. By David Grand. (Arcade, $23.95.)

There may be thousands of satisfied customers of these services and students who received hefty aid through the information they provided.
