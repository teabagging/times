For this reason this higher-education package flies in the face of the arguments advanced by the Reagan Administration that Government policy should encourage the private sector to do more so that government can do less. Public college and university costs are subsidized by taxpayers who support these institutions through state and local taxes. Most state higher-education systems fix their institutional budgets by using a formula that is driven by student enrollments. More students transferring from private to public institutions because they can no longer qualify for Federal student aid will obviously drive up the costs to taxpayers in the states.\\n\\nThus the transfer of students from private to public institutions will be accompanied by a transfer of higher-education expenses from the Federal budget to state budgets. This the shift of enrollments will, in turn, result in underutilized physical plants at many private institutions and a demand for new construction on campuses of public institutions.

Cohan Theatre by Columbia Pictures Corporation. It is still another pictorial account of back-stage life, one in which the father takes to drink and the mother goes ahead as a vaudeville entertainer. They are eventually brought together again by their young son, Buddy, and all is blissfully happy at this writing. But they begin their sad story again this afternoon.Judging by the reception of this audible film. Miss Baker will probably add to her list of admirers. In nearly all the scenes she serves the screen well with her singing and her sighing moments. Her deep-toned voice rendering \\"Take Everything But You\\" caused several persons to hum that melody as they left the theatre.Miss Baker is earnest and sincere in her work, but the incidental narrative is anything but original. A first birthday party is for Tom Gibson, the father, who has slipped off the water-wagon in a gentle fashion. The next birthday party, not long afterward, is for Buddy, the youngster, whose cake not only has candles but also the figures of his mother, his father and himself—the \\"Three Musketeers,\\" as they dub themselves. A symbolic gesture is perceived at this juncture, for Buddy in putting his knife through the cake cuts the figure of his father away from his mother and himself.Another blonde here is temporarily victorious in capturing Tom, and Buddy is sent to a military school. In course of time Anna Gibson (Miss Baker) entertains in the Paradise Cabaret, and in this sequence there is some fair comedy besides Miss Baker's singing. Just when opportunity is knocking on Anna's door, her husband is gradually weakening in his admiration for Mazie, the charmer, with yellow hair.The producers then have the bright ifea of depicting Tom with his whisky bottle. He is uncertain in speech and unshorn. Not long afterward Anna is singing one of her favorite songs in the vaudeville theatre and when she finishes Buddy, who is in a proscenium box, continues the melody. By his side is his father, looking contrite but hopeful of having the \\"three musketeers\\" banded together again.David Houseman figures as Joe, a performer who is always borrowing matches or cold cream, promising to return everything some time. He stirs up several laughs and there are several lines that proved quite amusing.Whether he is depicting Tom drunk, Tom sober, or Tom fascinated by Mazie, Ralph Graves does creditable acting. David Durand, the youngster who acted Buddy, knows no fear of the microphone. He gives a competent if precocious performance. Eunice Quedens makes Mazie quite lifelike.

Mr. Parr, it develops, attracts a cabaret girl because of his wealth and, after being flattered into believing he could regain his youth through excessive frivolity, divorces his wife and marries the other woman. After several gay parties with the coterie usually known as vaudevillains, he longs for the simple things in life and for his wife and son. He goes back, but not until Miss Bennett, as the divorcee, has played with him and made him appear the old fool. The film, in fact, illustrates the adage that \\"There's no fool like an old fool.\\"Of the cast, Dorothy Burgess's performance as the younger woman is by far the most enjoyable.

Kiam's friends, neighbors and staff at 630 Park Avenue. We extend our deepest and most sincere sympathies at the loss of the man who has been our Board President for over 30 years. Victor was our building's leader. He was a friend to all of his neighbors and they trusted him as the loyal, wise elder who kept everyone's concerns close to his heart. We knew him as someone blessed with warmth and affection. During the recent annual shareholders meeting, it was Mr. Kiam who lauded one of our staff members for his years of consistently fine performance before suggesting we honor that person as he approached a major milestone in his life. A small gesture to be sure, but one that spoke volumes about Victor's deeply felt sense of loyalty. It was not the first time this good man demonstrated the meaning of the word ''gentleman.'' He was that in every respect. We are grateful to him for being so completely himself-courageous, optimistic, compassionate and relentlessly encouraging. Victor was one of those rare people who was not afraid to extend his love to everyone. He had a remarkable talent for making all of us feel at ease in his presence. His cheerful disposition will be missed, but never forgotten. Those of us who knew him are made poorer by his absence, but richer for having shared in his great charm, hardy good humor, sharp intellect and, most of all, his enduring friendship.     KIAM-Victor K. Dear Victor, a heart of gold and charisma, a unique combination. My hero and beloved confidante and friend. You know you were my personal and professional role model and mentor. An uncanny ability to make everyone around you feel incredibly special. You gave to all without expecting anything in return. Victor, you and Ellen have built a family that will always be my foundation. Thank you for including me in your family and heart. I will always cherish our time spent together, and your inner strength and beauty will always serve as my guide. I will love and support your family forever, and you can rest assured that they will continue to ''go for it'' in life and in tennis! Love always, Jay B. Horowitz     KIAM-Victor. We celebrate the life of our friend of forty-five years, Victor Kiam. He was a presence, a force, a personality. He lived life with zest, with gusto, with passion. He steered around curves others thought too sharp, climbed mountains others thought too steep, leapt chasms others thought too wide. And he triumphed, and he succeeded, and he won. He brought exhilaration and exuberance to all our lives. We shall all miss him mightily. Our hearts and love go out to Ellen, Lisa, Tory, Robin, and the rest of the family. Sandy and Ed Meyer     KIAM-Victor. Victor's enthusiasm, enjoyment of life, and positive attitude enriched our lives. We will miss our good friend, Life Master bridge opponent, and tennis champion buddy. To his wonderful family, we send our love and sympathy. Betty and John     KIAM-Victor.

As a  child, I would stare at those dinner-spoilers -- sticky, delicious and too big for me to finish -- long before the turkey hit the table. The problem was, I never really cared for the pecans. I would gnaw away at the tops of the buns, chewing my way around the pecans before discarding them behind a couch pillow or under someone else's napkin.         My grandmother, unfooled, frowned upon this procedure and would slap her slender hand on the dining-room table and bellow, \\"Do you know how much pecans cost a pound?\\" (The price varied, depending on whether she got them from the Daughters of the American Revolution.

However, the Greek Government has repeatedly asked that the marbles be returned to Greece. In a recent interview with The New York Times, Melina Mercouri, the Greek Minister of Culture under the Government of Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou, and a passionate spokesman for the marbles' repatriation, argued that the sculptures were removed from the Parthenon without sufficient legal authority or payment - and that they belong in Greece because they form an essential part and symbol of Greek history and its national heritage. \\n\\nFor reasons ranging from legal to purely practical, many art scholars and museum curators disagree with Miss Mercouri's views","excerpt":"below, Richard Brilliant, professor of art history and archeology at Columbia University, presents some of the arguments in favor of keeping the sculptures in Great Britain.

Kochina is the religion of the Hopi Indians. The dolls and dances represent various elements of the cycle of life and their interconnection.   The demonstrations will take place at Steve's Trading Post, 471 Tuckahoe Road, where Steve Katz, the owner, sells jewelry, pottery, basketry, rugs, sculpture, headdresses, drums and other crafts from more than 30 tribes he visits nationwide.   The dolls are carved from cottonwood roots and can be 1 to 18 inches tall. They can be male or female, shaped and painted to depict clowns, spirits, the seasons, maidens and braves. They sometimes have eagle feather headdresses, leather boots and jewelry that has been handed down from previous generations. They are a common sight hanging on the walls in Hopi households.    Mr. Huma is from the village of First Mesa on the 40,000-acre Navajo Reservation near Flagstaff, Ariz. \\"Marlon has become a special friend,\\" Mr. Katz said, \\"and I am returning his hospitality to me by inviting him here for awhile to see how I live.\\" Mr. Huma, 30 years old, is married and has three children. He has traveled outside Arizona only once, to a powwow in Oklahoma.   \\"There are only 9,000 Hopis left,\\" Mr. Katz said, \\"and they survive by making and selling their handiwork.\\" The dolls take about two weeks to complete, not because the work is so time consuming but because Hopis have a different perception of time.   The dolls sell for $250 to $1,400. A few will be for sale, and others can be ordered from Mr. Huma. The number to call for more information is 779-9613. BOOK AND AUTHOR LUNCH    Four noted authors will speak at the Westchester Library Association's Book and Author Luncheon tomorrow at noon at the Tarrytown Hilton. This is to be the first of a series of yearly luncheons featuring speakers and giving the libraries an opportunity to promote themselves in a time of economic constraint.   George J. Delaney, vice president of Consolidated Edison, which helped underwrite the event, will serve as chairman.   The authors will talk about their most recent books, all published within the last year. They are Robert Stone, author of \\"Outerbridge Reach,\\" published by Ticknor & Fields","excerpt":"Belva Plain, whose \\"Treasures\\" was published by Delacorte; Gary Sick, author of \\"October Surprise,\\" published by Times Books, and Robert Kotlowitz, whose \\"His Master's Voice\\" is from Knopf.   Packages containing information and souvenirs from the county's 38 libraries will be placed on each chair, and tickets at $30 may be purchased at the hotel or at the Getty Square, Grinton I. Will and Crestwood library branches in Yonkers. RUSSIAN ART SHOW    The Russians are coming to the Somerstown Gallery today, depicted in paintings and photographs, which will remain on exhibition through July 5.   Oils by Sergei Polyakov, now living in Moscow but originally from Belarus (formerly Byelorussia), are exuberant, bold and colorful, evoking the myths and fairy tales of Old Russia with humor and style.   Marjorie Michael has produced a series of paintings of Russia's massive and elaborate medieval churches, restored during the last few decades by the Soviet Government. She followed the route of the so- called Golden Ring of churches from Moscow through the Yaroslavi, Kostroma and Vladimir regions of northeastern Russia.   Two Russians, Anatoly Loshmanov and Sergei Kuzmin, and one American, Lisa Toto, contributed the photographic images in the show, capitalizing on the increased freedom of photojournalists to record what they wish on film.   Mr. Kuzmin has been a photographer for Pravda and the Free Trade Union Journal, while Mr. Loshmanov was director of photography for the Kiev Movie Studio before branching out on his own to maintain a freelance photography studio.   Ms. Toto left her job at the Bridgeport Post to make three trips to Russia, where she photographed the wasteland created by the Chernobyl nuclear accident and former President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, among other subjects.   During the opening reception today from 2 to 5 P.M. a slide presentation of Russian landmarks, sculpture and art will be given by Leonid Hushmatov. The gallery, on Route 100 in Somers, is open Tuesdays through Sundays from 1 to 5 P.M. More information is available by calling 277-3461. VASSAR BOOK SALE    More than 300 Westchester students have obtained scholarships to Vassar through a book sale that the college has held each year since 1959. In the process, more than 1.25 million books and related items have been sold. The 1992 sale will be held at the County Center in White Plains Friday through Sunday from 10 A.M. to 6 P.M.   A collector's corner will feature first editions, unusual illustrated books, autographed and rare books and books noted mainly for their tiny size and great age. In addition there will be a collection of books on the archeology of the South Pacific and pre-Columbian regions, books on antiques, Japanese dolls and fine art, cookbooks, children's books, records, mysteries and languages, including Spanish, French, German, Swedish, Russian, Hungarian and Japanese.   Paperbacks will cost 50 cents, and 40,000 hardcovers, $1 and more. At unscheduled times, instant bargain sales, a Vassar tradition, will occur, giving patrons a half-hour to buy all they can carry for half price or purchase any book with a red cover for 25 cents for 10 minutes or take advantage of other quick-sale incentives. The phone number for more information is 948-4115 or 761-8376. NEW SUNNYSIDE WALK    A walk in the woods that Washington Irving himself used to stroll has been reopened at Sunnyside, his home in Tarrytown. Historic Hudson Valley, with a grant of $50,000, expanded the half-mile trail and installed a wooden bridge and benches at scenic overlooks along the Hudson River.   Using as reference material drawings from 1856 that show a path and benches near the stream, the project, which took more than a year, afforded an opportunity to open up eight acres of formerly inaccessible property and create a picnic area.   Guided walks and discussions of the Romantic Landscape tradition will be held every Saturday from 11 A.M. to 4 P.M. on the hour through the end of August. The trail is open to visitors on their own daily except Tuesdays from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. From July 4 through Labor Day, the trail will be open until 8 P.M. Saturdays and Sundays, offering views of sunsets across the river.   Sunnyside is just off Route 9, one mile south of the Tappan Zee Bridge. Admission to the grounds is $3 and includes the guided and unguided walks. Those who wish to take guided tours of Irving's house will be charged $3 in addition to the grounds admission. The number to call for more information is 631-8200.

I emerged from the three-and-one-half-hour ordeal struck by the too large number of questions that emphasized the achievements of minorities, women and third world countries","excerpt":"bemoaned the shortcomings of American society, and advanced fashionable causes.   That such causes are presented in what is supposed to be an objective test is surprising; that they are advanced in a way that ultimately compromises them is sad.   The questions  [ verified with the Educational Testing Service last week ]  informed us that the writer Zora Neale Hurston had been exposed to black folklore at an early age; that \\"Invisible Man\\" by Ralph Ellison was considered a great book when it was published and probably will always be considered one, and that \\"The Piano Lesson\\" by August Wilson chronicles his experience and is set in Pittsburgh.    So far, so good. There's nothing wrong with references to the lives of writers or a celebration of their works. As it happens, I admire these writers.    The problem is that the unrelieved piling up of such citations amounted to a racial focus of skewed proportions. The questions cited Richard Wright, Gwendolyn Brooks, Lorraine Hansberry and Jackie Robinson, twice. It seemed as if almost half the questions that named real people named blacks. Furthermore, the fiction-reading comprehension section was from Maya Angelou's \\"I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings.\\"   The Educational Testing Service also took pains to focus on other minorities. There were questions about Mexican Americans, native Americans and Eskimos. And, as a nod to third world supporters, the test mentioned Zimbabwe's celebration in 1982 of its second year of independence.   Other questions emphasized women. Doris Lessing, we were reminded, is the 20th century's Jane Austen. There was a reading-comprehension section about the English author Fanny Wright and her book about the early U.S. -- a book, we were told, that recognized some of the country's problems but failed to understand how difficult solutions would be.   I, too, think that recycling paper is a good idea. But when a question that mentions white men stresses Theodore Roosevelt's contribution to wilderness conservation, and a reading-comprehension passage speaks of delicate lake ecosystems, it all begins to seem a bit simple-minded.    Stung by criticism that the S.A.T. has been culturally biased, the E.T.S. has, it seems, tried to redeem itself and perhaps avert future criticism by emphasizing the achievements of minorities and women. The trouble is that this emphasis reveals as much about stereotypical thinking as anything could and may well offend many students -- minority and majority, male and female -- who take the test.    African-Americans, women and Asians should complain because the E.T.S., in so pointedly turning stereotypes upside down, highlights them. Jews should complain because Albert Einstein and Saul Bellow seem not to be subjects of questions. Men should complain because they rarely seem to achieve anything unless they're of minority origin. Everyone should complain because, in one way or another, the S.A.T. distorts reality.   This imbalance reflects a conformism that is prevalent in America and that hurts all of us, particularly those whose causes it seeks to advance.

Yet he continues to exert a unique fascination, both for his accomplishments and for the manner in which he undertook them. At his peak, he was unarguably the best in the game. He won nine major championships -- four United States Opens, two P.G.A. Championships, two Masters and a British Open -- over the eight seasons from 1946 to 1953, a remarkable achievement considering his near-fatal auto accident in 1949. In 1959 (when the 19-year-old Jack Nicklaus won the United States Amateur), Hogan, then 46, entered the Open at the Winged Foot Golf Club in Mamaroneck, N.Y. During one of the practice rounds, he caught the attention of Jules Alexander, a photographer and weekend golfer, who fell under the Hawk's spell and stalked him during the tournament, shooting more than 100 photographs. His black-and-white pictures, vivid and rich in detail, are the basis for THE HOGAN MYSTIQUE: Classic Photographs of the Great Ben Hogan (The American Golfer/Triumph, $50). Included are a running commentary by Ken Venturi, the golf analyst and a longtime friend of Hogan's, and essays by Dave Anderson, a sports columnist at The New York Times","excerpt":"Ben Crenshaw, a two-time Masters champion and a historian of the game; and Dan Jenkins, the sportswriter. Although not meant as an instructional text, the book reflects Hogan's technique and shot-making skill throughout. One striking example is a pair of photos of his follow-through on two different shots, both taken at the same angle from behind and at first glance almost identical. Mr. Venturi notes that in one, Hogan's extended, slightly higher finish indicates that he is hitting a fade with a fuller shot; in the other, Hogan's right hand has crossed over, the club face is down and the finish is flatter, indicating that he is playing a draw. The essays are a solid counterpoint to the photographs. \\"I have this notion,\\" Mr. Jenkins writes, \\"that if Ben Hogan . . . had ever worn a green shirt and yellow slacks on a golf course, he couldn't have broken 85.\\"  GORDON T.THOMPSON In Pursuit of Ben Hogan"},{"year":"1973","title":"SAN ANTONIO, Tex., Now 3 (AP)&#8212","excerpt":"Ben Crenshaw, broke a four&#8208;way tie for the lead with a five&#8208;under&#8208;par 66 today and again took the top spot in the $125,000 San Antonio&#8212;Texas open golf tour&#8208;narnent.

It seemed to satisfy the audience at the Hippodrome yesterday afternoon, for there was laughter and, at the end, applause. It is not a dignified piece of work and neither is it ever convincing. Ben Lyon looks no more like a Yale athlete than Richard \\"Skeets\\" Gallagher looks like a coxswain of a racing shell. But during the boat race scenes, supposedly between Yale and Harvard, there is quite a good deal of interest, even though you have a hazy idea that Ben Lyon's arms are not stroking the Yale crew. Here, Yale wins. It would be interesting to see this production in Cambridge, Mass., if the exhibitor had forgotten to change a few titles and still have Yale win.Mike, the hero of this extravaganza, is first perceived as an active and attractive baby, not quite a year old. He is left on the doorstep and brought up by Abraham Katz, Herman Schultz and Patrick O'Malley, who, as the child's adopted fathers, show their ignorance of infants. It is a case of necessity being the mother of invention when it comes to dressing the baby and arranging it so that the child can drink its milk. Sometimes this baby looks at George Sidney, Ford Sterling and Hugh Cameron, who officiate in the rôles of the fathers, as if wondering why these grown-up, plump specimens of humanity were making so much fuss and being so inordinately ridiculous. What this infant prodigy might have muttered if he had been able to read the comic subtitles would perhaps have been even more interesting than his expression of contempt at some of the pantomime.Rudolph Cameron figures as the man with a past who is eager to collect a few sheckels wherever possible. He contributes some really thoughtful acting, which is more than Ben Lyon does. In fact, Mr. Lyon suffers by comparison in those scenes in which he appears with Rudolph Cameron (there are two Camerons in this film). Claudette Colbert, who was seen in Kenyon Nicholson's play \\"The Barker,\\" lends her charm to this obstreperous piece of work. She seems quite at home before the camera.

Both of these nations need a dose of reality -- a two-by-four right across the side of the head to be exact -- that probably  only the U.S. can provide at this time.

But when he finally came home last week, it was in the trappings of a peacemaker. Waving above the heads of the 150,000 supporters who flocked to cheer him were banners proclaiming \\"Nkomo for stability,\\" \\"Nkomo for peace,\\" \\"Nkomo for unity.\\"  The preference helps explain the heavy-handed policy that British colonial authorities in Rhodesia have adopted toward Mr. Nkomo's erstwhile partner in the guerrilla war, Robert Mugabe, who London fears might prove a practicing as well as a rhetorical Marxist in power. The British also doubt that Mr. Mugabe could survive the violent factional fighting that has characterized hls Zimbabwe African Na tional Union since it broke with Mr. Nkomo in 1963.  Some officials in Salisbury argue that even a Mugabe abrogation of the truce would not torpedo the settlement, as long as Mr. Nkomo remained \\"on-side,\\" as the Rhodesian parlance adopted by the British expresses it. If Mr. Mugabe pulled out, so the argument goes, he would be leaving the electoral field open to his rivals, primarily Mr. Nkomo and white Rhodesians' first black standard-bearer, Bishop Abel T. Muzorewa. The government that emerged, if it included Mr. Nkomo, would be assured of the backing of much of the world, presumably including the Soviet Union, Mr. Nkomo's principal backer in the war. China, Mr. Mugabe's main sup plier, would have the unenviable choice of accepting the new government or of supporting a continued insurgency with no certainty of success. The same considerations would apply for Tanzania and Mozambique, Mr. Mugabe's best African friends, with the added drawback that support for a pro tracted war would deny their battered economies the relief that peace in Rhodesia could bring.

''I'm not a Broadway baby, a belter, a razzle-dazzle kind of kid,'' she explained. Indeed, in her early cabaret performances, and on Broadway in ''Nine'' and ''Grand Hotel,'' Ms. Akers, above, honed her regal bearing and nonindulgent way with a tune to such a degree that you could hardly imagine her coming within a mile of a sequin or a shout. So the news that her new gig at the Oak Room would consist of songs by John Kander and Fred Ebb -- they of ''New York, New York'' and ''Cabaret,'' of the streetwise insouciance and ha-cha-cha dissipation -- seemed to suggest a misalliance. But two things conspire to predict a good match. One is that Ms. Akers's style has become less Olympian, more personal","excerpt":"beneath the perfect diction and lucid phrasing you can hear her heartbeat. It's also true that the Kander and Ebb catalog is more varied, and frequently much darker, than their most Lizafied songs might indicate at first glance. ''I went to the music and found that it offered me a lot more latitude than I expected,'' Ms. Akers said. ''It opened itself up to me.'' That's because the songs were written for complex theatrical situations; the balance between hopefulness and the implied despair that makes hopefulness necessary is always being negotiated. Still, she ''sidestepped'' most of the flashier numbers in favor of actorly songs from lesser-known shows like ''The Happy Time,'' ''The Rink,'' ''70, Girls, 70,'' ''The Act'' and ''Steel Pier.'' But ''Cabaret'' is not entirely shut out. From that show Ms. Akers will sing the relentlessly conditional ''Maybe This Time'' and, most fittingly, ''Married'': a perfect ode to mismatches that aren't.

For years, some foreign experts have contended that Japan's stock market is rigged to reinforce the interrelations that hold the Japanese business and political worlds together, with the authorities an integral part of the secretive system.

(Picador, $14.) Hazzard's first novel in more than 20 years, set in the smoldering aftermath of World War II, revolves around the love affair between a 32-year-old English veteran and a precocious 17-year-old he meets in Japan, a relationship that undergoes numerous vicissitudes as the narrative depicts a world and a time in chaos. ''Hazzard is a fine, at times a superb, writer,'' John Banville wrote here last year, and this novel, which won a National Book Award, ''has passages that shine with a hard, steady, gemlike flame.'' Picador has also reissued Hazzard's first two works of fiction. In Cliffs of Fall: And Other Stories ($13), she ''plunges bravely up to her ankles in . . . little currents of domestic crisis,'' our reviewer, Stanley Kauffmann, wrote in 1963, whether it involves infidelity, estrangement or some other form of marital trouble. The Evening of the Holiday ($12) follows the fortunes of an Englishwoman who falls in love with a local man during a summer trip to a small Italian town","excerpt":"beneath the surface of their romance, and the clash of cultures and climates, ''is a complexity of ideas and effects,'' Laurence Lafore said here in 1966. The novel is ''extraordinarily intense.''    TERROR AND LIBERALISM, by Paul Berman. (Norton, $13.95.) A liberal interventionist issues a manifesto that seeks to chart a course between right-wing ''realists'' and left-wing ''anti-imperialists,'' one that sees the Middle East's tyrants and terrorists as heirs to the totalitarian ambitions of the Bolsheviks and Nazis. The result is ''an eloquent, strangely quixotic, frustratingly uneven effort,'' Gary Rosen wrote in these pages in 2003.    BEYOND BELIEF: The Secret Gospel of Thomas, by Elaine Pagels. (Vintage, $13.) The author, whose 1979 book ''The Gnostic Gospels'' focused on the 1945 discovery of early deviant Christian texts in Egypt, re-examines these secret documents and argues that the suppression of texts like ''The Gospel of Thomas'' has impoverished Christian teaching. ''This packed, lucid little book'' succeeds as ''a spiritual as well as an intellectual exercise,'' Frank Kermode wrote in the Book Review in 2003. According to the scholar James L. Kugel in The God of Old: Inside the Lost World of the Bible (Free Press, $13), God in the early books of the Bible was by turns invisible and visible -- so palpably visible that he can be easily seen and touched. Last year our reviewer, Jack Miles, said these erudite lectures ''are as clear as water, explaining themselves effortlessly as they go.''    THE PURSUIT OF ALICE THRIFT, by Elinor Lipman. (Vintage Contemporaries, $12.95.) Though it starts out promisingly, the unlikely romance between a lonely, socially tactless doctor and a crass fudge salesman looks increasingly doomed as the couple draw closer to their calamitous wedding. ''The great accomplishment'' of this droll novel is ''Lipman's ability to chart the course of this mismatch in an utterly persuasive way,'' Karen Karbo said here last year.    THE BOOK OF SALT, by Monique Truong. (Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $13.) The narrator of this lush, expansive first novel is Binh, a gay Vietnamese cook who works for Gertrude Stein and Alice B. Toklas in 1930's Paris. His aching distance from his native Saigon stands in sharp relief to the cheerful exile of his employers, and for him cooking -- whether Vietnamese delicacies or American apple pie -- is a ''way of remembering the world.'' The mood ''is one of melancholy and loss, alleviated by Binh's unsated appetite for love and food, and his delight in that other gift of the tongue, language,'' Christopher Benfey wrote in these pages in 2003.    A THIRD FACE: My Tale of Writing, Fighting, and Filmmaking, by Samuel Fuller with Christa Lang Fuller and Jerome Henry Rudes. (Applause, $18.95.) Though his life started out in Horatio Alger fashion, the maverick writer and director Samuel Fuller (1912-97) saw his fortunes decline as the old Hollywood system changed in the 1960's. This portrait of the creator of ''Pickup on South Street'' and ''The Big Red One'' is ''a lot like one of Fuller's best movies -- fast-paced, easily readable but with the sting of harsh realism on every page,'' Richard Schickel wrote here in 2002. ''It captures the unique sound of Fuller talking -- growling, gritty, hypnotic.''

The edge in question is not the literal border between youth and adulthood but, rather, the uneasy frisson between implicit innocence and the forces that corrupt it.\\n\\nThe show's guest curator, Barbara Coller, has selected works by 21 artists to illuminate issues like family life, game-playing, education and sexuality. Discarding the trite simplistic notion of childhood as a safe haven from the world's woes, she sees it instead as \\"a period of minimal power and control over one's environment, a time of great vulnerability.\\"\\n\\nThe artists' works fall into two broad categories, those that use objects or images associated with childhood and those that employ a naive or childlike style. Sometimes both strategies are present in a single piece, but in all cases the artists are engaged in a dialogue between idealism and reality.\\n\\nToys are the most pervasive metaphor in this dialogue. Their potent symbolism has long been recognized by artists, who often distort their function to inject psychological tension and disquieting implications.\\n\\nDolls in particular lend themselves to that sort of manipulation. Barbie and Ken receive the lion's share of attention, with four artists using one or both of them to embody dysfunctional aspects of the American Dream.\\n\\nIn Jaune Quick-to-See Smith's version, \\"Paper Dolls for a Post-Columbian World,\\" the stereotypes are Indians whose outfits reinforce preconceptions of their social and historical roles. The make-believe idyll of the Barbie-Ken relationship is shattered in the eponymous Ken Botto's photograph, \\"Red Chair,\\" a scene that suggests domestic violence.\\n\\nLaurie Simmons lampoons an old advertising gimmick in \\"Walking House,\\" a photograph of Barbie's legs projecting from a model of a suburban cottage. The dream girl and the dream house are a single entity, highlighting the image of female domesticity that the toys of many girls project. \\n\\nParran Collery's \\"Miss Juicy Fruit Collection\\" is similarly critical of female typecasting, using Barbie bathing suits pinned in a case like insect specimens as a critique of standardized beauty.\\n\\nParadoxical toys are a recurring device, as in Chris Macdonald's \\"Untitled (Flying Car No. 2).\\" Crudely made of wood with knifelike spirals of steel projecting from its front, the car looks more like an engine of destruction than a harmless amusement. The artist focuses on the element of destructiveness that often underlies the energetic playfulness of children.\\n\\nThe trenchant symbolism of Michael Jenkins's work masquerades as brightly painted cardboard cutouts. His castle and boat look as if they were made of the old appliance cartons that youngsters love to recycle, but their yellow color alludes to quarantine. The castle may be a fortress against disease or a prison for the infected. Is the boat an escape craft or a hospital ship?\\n\\nIf children's possessions are freighted with ominous meanings, so, too, are the children themselves. Several artists highlight the vulnerability identified by Ms. Coller, especially as it relates to sexuality, but also in terms of socialization.\\n\\nOne of the most unnerving examples is Rona Pondick's \\"Loveseat,\\" a construction in which analogies to a male adult and a female child are suggestively unified. The chair's voluptuous overstuffed form and lacy upholstery enhance the depravity of a forbidden relationship.\\n\\nCollier Schorr also deals with corruption in her sculptures made of little girls' dresses stiffened with plaster. Crude messages are scribbled inside the skirts, forcing the viewer to peer into the dresses like voyeurs. The everyday language reminds us how casually our words and actions can degrade the helpless.\\n\\nUltimate control is exercised in Dennis Farber's photograph \\"Megan,\\" showing a man holding an infant in a chained straitjacket. The frontal confrontational portrait of the child as victim graphically depicts physical and mental cruelty in the form of constraint, rather than overt violence.\\n\\nThe mental constraints imposed by adults on children are symbolized by education in works by Michael Aurbach and Gary Simmons. Mr. Aurbach's \\"Final Portrait: American Indian\\" uses emblems of the schoolroom to criticize the distorted history lessons that \\"erase\\" the Indian's past. Similarly, Mr. Simmons's \\"Disinformation-Supremacy Board\\" is a classroom in which the lessons are for whites only.\\n\\nThe exhibition's complex and contradictory view of childhood is an antidote to the sentiment and nostalgia that often keeps adults from appreciating and dealing with children's problems.\\n\\nAs unsettling as their insights may be, the artists ask us to face the complexities and take our share of the responsibility for resolving the conflicts. For, as Kahlil Gibran wrote in \\"On Children,\\" we are \\"the bows from which \\n[\\nour\\n]\\n children as living arrows are sent forth.\\"\\n\\n\\"The Edge of Childhood\\" is on view till Nov. 1.

And if this isn't always the most practical point of view to be taken by the guardians of the public peace, it at least gives a little garden-variety fable like \\"Butch Minds the Baby,\\" now at Loew's State, a haphazardly amusing flavor.Actually, it is the rather familiar yarn of the ex-con trying rather unsuccessfully to lead a beatific life until a babbling 1-year-old really draws him away from such bad habits as smoking, drinking and safe-blowing. And of course the film wouldn't be true Runyon whimsy if Butch finally didn't have to blow a safe and take the rap for the sake of the youngster's future. Nor would the story be typically Runyonesque if he hadn't gathered into its slight plot such colorful dopes as Harry the Horse, Jack the Beefer, or Squinty Sweeny, who never recognized his friends until they slapped him down.As Butch, Broderick Crawford creates a creditable portrait of mental insolvency, Virginia Brace looks coolly maternal as the widowed mother of bright-eyed Michael Barnitz, who is 13 months old and no slouch.

The unspoken message: guilt by association. Mr. Klein's Commercial   PRODUCER -- Fenn, King, Murphy Communications, Washington.   ON THE AIR -- The 60-second ad features an announcer who sounds like a carnival pitchman saying, \\"Stand up, Bill, you won the doozy for talking about cutting spending in Congress even though you, Bill Martini, know how to waste money better than anyone in New Jersey. You voted to approve $23 million in cost overruns on the county administration building. Originally budgeted at $15 million, now it will cost taxpayers over $100 million, including interest. Now that's a doozy. And that's why you, Bill Martini, are the winner of the lifetime doozy award.\\"   ANALYSIS -- The \\"doozy ad\\" is an effort to throw the \\"tax and spend\\" charge right back at Mr. Martini.   But Mr. Martini wasn't even on the Passaic County Board of Freeholders when the project was first discussed in 1988, or when it was designed or put out to bid.    \\"In fact, when I joined the board in January 1993, the building was already 85 percent completed,\\" he said.    And despite the fact that the site had some unexpected environmental problems that contributed to its final $38 million cost, the entire project's overrun was less than 4 percent, he said.   Mr. Klein, of course, is gambling that even if voters hear both sides of the story, what they will remember when they get in the voting booth is something about Mr. Martini and a project that ended up costing millions.
