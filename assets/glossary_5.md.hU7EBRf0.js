It's simple. Just get a two-headed turtle. Thomas Nelson Community College in Hampton, Va., has 2,000 students, but not until it was given the freak reptile last semester was it featured in newspapers from Korea to Germany -- not to mention a science show on Canadian national television.          \\"It is an amazing turtle, it really is,\\" said Susan C. Fortunato, who supervises the laboratory in the college's natural sciences department. The turtle, named This and That, was donated by John Keinath, a snapping-turtle expert who is an adjunct professor at Thomas Nelson. Some 2 percent of turtles are believed to be born with two heads, Dr. Keinath estimated, but most die quickly.

Television news producers can count on advocacy groups to supply them with model victims for viewing purposes, people who may even be untouched by the other afflictions discovered in the recent survey of the homeless: mental illness, AIDS, domestic violence and lack of education and skills.

And, in male territory, the most conspicuous sexual harassers -- Kirk on NBC's \\"Dear John\\" or, on Fox, Al Bundy of \\"Married . . .

It's a more entertaining thing to have the visual evidence in front of you. In his early television appearances, Elvis curls his upper lip, bends his knees, swivels his hips and looks as if he can barely restrain himself from leaping around the stage. His hair is in a glossy high pompadour and he has the aura of a man who knows he's gorgeous and irresistible.         But if you really want the secret of Elvis's appeal, glance behind him. His backup singers, the Jordinaires, wear gray business suits with neat white handkerchiefs sticking out of their breast pockets. They snap their fingers calmly. They have excellent posture. They look as if they might be more comfortable crooning along with Bing Crosby, or maybe doing Elvis's taxes. Even  now this image says all you need to know about how Elvis rocked American pop culture.

By Susy Clemens. (Doubleday, $15.95.) In 1885, when Susy Clemens was 13 years old and her beloved father, Mark Twain, was 50, she undertook the task of writing his biography. It begins ''We are a very happy family!'' and ends abruptly in midsentence about a year later. Twain, having just published ''The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,'' was at the height of his fame and powers, but the reader sees this only obliquely through Susy's fond but limited childhood gaze. Most of what she describes is domestic - Twain forced by his children to invent stories based on the furniture in the library (thus producing a romance about a fender, tongs and a ''shuvel'')","excerpt":"Twain suggesting that Biblical names be used for the chess pieces so he could play on Sunday; Twain cursing while shaving; acting in family charades; writing letters in schoolboy German; and providing names for the many household cats. Susy, who died of spinal meningitis when she was 24, writes of all this with the unaffected warmth and charm of a child and with what her father called her ''frequently desperate'' spelling. After her death, her father annotated her work in his own unmistakable voice, here mellowed by loss and great affection. This is the first publication of Susy Clemens's ''Papa,'' which, as the title page says, has ''a Foreward and Copious Comments by Her Father.'' Twain's remarks, which are interspersed with Susy's, are explanatory, correcting and admiring. IN SHORT: NONFICTION"},{"year":"1992","title":"While scholars plunge into new debate over Huckleberry Finn's origins -- did Mark Twain, as one scholar suggests, adapt the voice of a black boy? -- only now will they be able to examine the whole work as Twain wrote it.

Just a look around the packed Waldorf-Astoria ballroom last week at a Mount Sinai Medical Center luncheon benefit proved the tweed takeover.   It seemed that every other woman was wearing a colorful tweed suit or jacket. Meanwhile, women are looking stylish in restaurants and at private dinner parties wearing short dinner dresses, often strapless, but unexpectedly made from the boldest of patterned tweeds.   Credit for this hearty cloth -- long associated with country life -- becoming a city fashion goes to Karl Lagerfeld at the House of Chanel in Paris, to the couturier Christian Lacroix and to the New York dress designer Bill Blass . They are all powerful trend-setters, and their ideas are often widely imitated.    Among the most popular tweeds are Mr. Lagerfeld's new version, which combines green and red yarns in the jacket and is trimmed with jeweled buttons, and Mr. Lacroix's suit combining three tweed patterns. Another favorite is Mr. Blass's made of socko-sized yellow, black and red plaid tweed.   The tweed dinner dresses were a quixotic idea of Mr. Blass's.
