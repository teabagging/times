This enjoyable pictorial effort is furnished with a few lines of restrained dialogue through the medium of the Vitaphone. It is a vast improvement over \\"Tenderloin,\\" the first feature production to be made by the Warner Brothers with sound.The story has a good deal of the charm of \\"Monsieur Beaucaire,\\" and it is, as a matter of fact, far better fashioned than was the film translation of that Booth Tarkington work. This current contribution is based on the love affair of that belle of Baltimore, Elizabeth Patterson, and Jerome Bonaparte, brother of the great Napoleon.In this instance it is the picture that matters rather than the spoken words, although there is one episode wherein Andrea de Segurola, the Metropolitan Opera singer, renders \\"The Marseillaise,\\" and it is emphatically stirring. This particular passage is adroitly worked out, with flashes of gentle comedy, a joyous scene of Bonaparte and Betsy declaring their love for each other and then the surprise of Betsy and others when the young man they imagine to be a French tutor is introduced as the younger brother of Napoleon.Every screen hero must prove his mettle, and so here Jerome is perceived as a wizard with the sword, one who humiliates the best swordsman of the South. It is till very nicely done, and no matter how romantic it may be you are not at all disappointed when Jerome whips his opponent's blade out of his hand or when he pinions the man against a wall.It is one of the finest screen productions that the Warners have made, and in spite of all its extravagancies it is a feature that meets with one's hearty approval. No more beauteous creature could fill the part of Betsy than Dolores Costello, who is perhaps more lovely in this rôle than in any of her previous portrayals.So far as the vocal interpolations are concerned, there might, it is true, have been an attempt to have a suggestion of French pronunciation in Conrad Nagel's utterances, but even that omission is pardonable. He might also have refrained from saying \\"Betsy\\" three times in the last episode, for you felt that then silence would have been golden. On the other hand. Miss Costello's subdued utterance of \\"My tomorrow has come,\\" was decidedly effective.The narrative opens near Baltimore, and after Bonaparte has taken Betsy for his wife they sail for France, the Emperor having a Princess in mind as the bride for his brother. Notwithstanding the written word of the Emperor, Betsy and Bonaparte hope for the great man to change his decision. There are scenes on the ship and Jerome and Betsy embrace as the Emperor is climbing aboard. Pasquale Amato officiates as Napoleon, and although he looks considerably older than Napoleon did at that time he does quite well with his impersonation.In this tale, Napoleon is adamant. He insists that Bets return to her native land and that young Jerome shall marry the Princess Fredericka of Württemberg. There is a scene aboard the ship where Betsy consents to obey the Emperor so long as he does not tell Jerome how long she and that young man are going to be separated. But no screen romance would be acceptable without having the lovers happy in the end, and this picture is no exception. It is arranged most deftly and the result was that last night many a handkerchief found its way to blue or brown or green eyes in the assemblage.Alan Crosland is to be congratulated on his direction of this film.

The starter who did not start while the Yankees experimented with an ineffective Dwight Gooden made a memopable debut and solidified that elusive spot in the starting rotation.

The pianist Abbey Simon won the Naumburg Competition in 1940, and on Sunday evening, he celebrated the 50th anniversary of that victory with a recital at Alice Tully Hall.    There have been times when Mr. Simon's playing was more fiery and overtly Romantic than it is now, although his brand of virtuosity has never been particularly ostentatious. On Sunday, the most striking aspect of his playing was its elegance, clarity and straightforwardness. In Beethoven's Sonata No. 31 (Op. 110), those qualities made for a reading that had the listener admiring the gracefulness of the work's construction and the sensitivity of Mr. Simon's touch, yet which failed to move the listener as the most insightful, soul-stirring performances do.      Schumann's Fantasy (Op. 17) was also fairly restrained, and there was some blurring of lines in the finale. But Mr. Simon has some unusual and for the most part interesting ideas about the work's phrase shapes, dynamics and pacing, which were often enlightening.    After the intermission, Mr. Simon gave an interestingly ruminative performance of Rachmaninoff's Variations on a Theme by Corelli (Op. 12), and deft, colorful accounts of Ravel's \\"Noctuelles,\\" \\"Oiseaux Tristes\\" and \\"Alborada del Gracioso.\\" Reviews/Music","excerpt":"Better Than a Birthday?"},{"year":"1995","title":"A DISPUTE has arisen over whether a no-holds-barred event -- known as \\"Extreme Fighting\\" or \\"Ultimate Fighting\\" -- should be held in the Brooklyn Armory next Saturday.

The director of the dig, Eric Sjogvist, amused at my reaction, observed how much more exciting it would have been to have found \\"the rich glory of the commonplace\\" -- you know, the things that would tell us so much more about antiquity than the official pieces -- Helen of Troy's shoe closet or Alexander the Great's collection of drinking cups (he was a notorious boozer in his last year). Had we had in our hands a copy of the imaginative, beautiful book called MAGNIFICENT OBSESSIONS: Twenty Remarkable Collectors in Pursuit of Their Dreams (Chronicle, paper, $19.95), by Mitch Tuchman, with spectacular photographs by Peter Brenner, we would have dreamed up far better ideas. This amusing and serious book is about 20 real collectors who are most certainly not collecting \\"dignified\\" things like Renaissance bronzes or Manet paintings, but vast, gorgeous and thoughtful works like Lionel trains, puzzles, toy soldiers and swizzle sticks. The book is a revelation and a joy. Mr. Tuchman, a California collector himself and editor in chief at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and Mr. Brenner, the museum's supervising photographer, present the collectors, their beliefs and their pieces compellingly. After reading the lucid and mesmerizing explanations of why these gifted collectors acquire puzzles or aquarium furniture and after looking at the dazzling photographs, you may become as hooked on the book as its subjects are by their satisfyingly strange artifacts.

Memory serves us strangely, if we're not careful, so herewith is a fuller 1994 sampler of other premises for jostling together down at time's shore, to wallow and wince.    Prohibition, for one big event, occurred 75 years ago, reason enough now for en masse bellying up to the bar. About 500,000 Americans were arrested across the following decade, certainly more than were busted in all the rock concerts ever held. Yet its liver-scarred participants never gather for some of that Dennis Hopper-toned hyperbolic whining of \\"Like-wow-man\\" at the timelessness of having been wasted together.    As for musical occasion, 50 years ago Glenn Miller disappeared as World War II was ending and about to flood the nation with big-band addicts eager to send the recording industry rocketing. He left, less self-tragic than Jimi Hendrix, as a soldier flying above the English Channel without so much as a baton or yellow ribbon to mark him. Even more might we now gather to mourn the day the music died, 35 years ago, when the prodigious Buddy Holly perished in the plane crash that took the Big Bopper and Ritchie Valens as well.    For commemorating the other deity in the Aquarian trinity, sex, now's the time for an original cast revival of \\"Oh! Calcutta!\\" the first Broadway vehicle to draw middle-class audiences with full-frontal nudity. That was 25 years ago, so to display the original cast, slackened and flaccid with time, might be the ultimate test of box-office nostalgia. Looking back at 1969, when Penthouse magazine began and the Saturday Evening Post closed after a century of modesty, you don't have to be swaying obeisantly in a mass of Deadheads to see how sex once was a less forbidding distraction than it has lately become.    As for fractious politics, there are those in the crowd who might be willing to attend a commemoration of the 25th anniversary of Earl Warren's rounding out his estimable career on the Supreme Court, if only because he forced his critics to find fresh excuses for national kvetch and conspiracy beyond \\"the Warren Court.\\" Others might want to skip any 25th reunions for the debut of The Brady Bunch","excerpt":"better to privately savor the undermining of faux wholesomeness that has followed.    Those are only a few opening milestones, with no reference to such occasions as George Bush's proclamation four years ago of this \\"decade of the brain\\" in which all Americans were urged to hail, study and otherwise groom the \\"three-pound mass of interwoven nerve cells.\\" But do we write? Do we call in?    And what about the 35th anniversary of Barbie, and still no genitalia? Or the 30th year of G.I. Joe, and still no manhood? And the 30th for Charlie the Tuna's first ego-crushing rejection, with, nonetheless, still no 9-millimeter fin-gun being brandished, bless the tepidness of Charlie's rage. Americans who think the 50th birthday of Smokey the Bear is cause for rallying should drive this weekend up the Thruway (I mean, the Thruway's open, man!) to Andover, N.Y., where more than 2,000 firefighters are feting Smokey like he was Arlo. Lows and Highs    Technology suggests other venues, certainly at our radios for the 10th anniversary of President Ronald Reagan's terrible practical joke: He made like he was warming up for the apocalyptic fireside chat and condemned the Russians in voice-testing an open microphone, announcing with all his head-bobbing, Paul Bunyan winsomeness: \\"The bombing begins in five minutes.\\" All our televisions, too, could be configured as a veritable Stonehenge for peering in mute wonder at that singular summer weekend 25 years ago when two enormous events were set to ever overlap in the memory of many.    First, we interrupt all programming to see Senator Edward M. Kennedy's Presidential appetite suddenly plunge in the dark gravity of Chappaquiddick; then, a day later, man walks like a feather on the moon, live before our eyes. (Richard Nixon intrudes like a grinning postage stamp in the TV picture corner, so oblivious to his own White House plunge-cum-pardon approaching five years later.) For the living nation, so history-shy, these glimpses may be all there is to establish collective definition and common purpose for wandering further into time.    All the more reason for combing memory for outbursts of laughter and vanity. Maybe geriatric biker gangs could terrorize a retirement village to commemorate the 70th anniversary of Marlon Brando's first mumblings in his crib. And it's 200 years since the first American millionaire, Cornelius Vanderbilt, was born and got The Donald treatment of undue respect. Marlon's nativity coincided with the sensational Leopold and Loeb trial, a case of affluent youths' murdering a random innocent in a fit of ennui, a case that gripped the nation like O. J.'s without benefit of TV rent-a-sages. It's 90 years since Ju-Jitsu was wildly popularized by Teddy Roosevelt, a moment for which the Beltway's massed castrati chorus of White House press corps veterans might lyrically commemorate the 20th century's earliest spin-controlled feeding-frenzy.    Dear Woodstockians, your best instincts can be handily marked right now elsewhere in history than Bethel. No one still struts more as a free spirit than Candide, the creature of Voltaire who was born a commemoratively tidy 300 years ago. \\"Let us cultivate our garden,\\" was Candide's epiphany, as in: Do your own thing. You can't relate to Voltaire? That's cool; how about the Munchkins of Oz convention in Wilmington, Del., this weekend? You just missed the Canadian Chocolate Festival in New Brunswick for getting off on unproscribed substances. If you're bummed out about all this call to memory, at least keep in mind that 10:33 P.M. E.D.T. today is the precise halfway point of summer, a sweet turning ever ignored but hyped less than the age of Aquarius.    The calendar has lots more going ungathered over: 50 years since the first bikini whittled life's mysteries, 20 years since streaking begged their restoration. Where would all of Woodstock's studied dressing down be without the dressing up historians mark at 1,000 years ago, when Anglo-Saxons invented the layered look and donned primal shirts and coats? There's a bog somewhere, a place for us to gather and really let go about this, reviewed this time by platoons of style writers.     On a simpler scale, we still have time to mass, in Hollywood, ideally, 200 years after men's hair powder was disfavored by the primping Founding Fathers. In doing so, they did spare the executive pigtail so sported now in authoritarian grays by some who style themselves as post-Woodstock successes spinning entertainment riches from all that they learned at the counter-culture. Daniel Berrigan, still conscientious after all these years, saw it all coming: \\"A revolution is interesting insofar as it avoids like the plague the plague it promised to heal.\\"    About the big plague, this year we can commemorate the 1,400th year of its ending. It leveled Europe's population by half but made all of us stronger for it, even if this health care debate is a drag. \\"For what has this world been formed?\\" Voltaire asked, answering: \\"To plague us to death.\\" Janis Joplin's point, exactly.    But before that there is much other overlooked life available for commemoration. It's 900 years since the first gondola defined the grace of Venice. Tomorrow, zealous gardeners celebrate national Sneak Some Zucchini Onto Your Neighbor's Porch Night. And, oh: 40 years since Joe D. married Marilyn, a decade after \\"The Glass Menagerie\\" made an American romance of memory. And 400 years since Shakespeare showed producers how to really pack spirited groundlings together, creating a coda that's Woodstockian enough in \\"As You Like It\\": \\"Last scene of all, that ends this strange eventful history, is second childishness and mere oblivion.\\" Ideas & Trends; Unforgettable, That's What It All Is, and Isn't"},{"year":"1989","title":"LEAD: Senator Christopher J.

And, though it ignores the majority of DP's in focusing its cameras exclusively on Jews and in sidestepping political issues, the film effectively paints a tragic situation which is still far from being alleviated.It is basically a story related through Yiddish, Polish and German dialogue and English titles of the Warsaw Jelins, father, mother and son, who are herded into a ghetto by the invaders, then sent to Auschwitz, where the patriarchal father is separated from his wife and liquidated. The son, on the other hand, escapes from the train carrying him to a concentration camp, joins the partisans and at the war's end meets Dora Berkowitz, a German DP, and makes the weary trek from one DP camp to another in search of his mother. And, while a happy ending is epitomized in the reunion of the family, a homeland for the group ironically remains only a hope.According to program notes, most of the \\"performers\\" are nonprofessionals and are erstwhile DP's.

It was a call that most Broadway audiences chose not to heed.

The inevitable question arose: Had the production's creators crossed into dark territory best left unexplored by the ''light'' musical?\\n\\n Whether such territory really exists remains a subject for debate, one that will surely be reanimated when ''Parade,'' a musical inspired by the 1915 lynching of Leo Frank, a Jewish man in Marietta, Ga., opens on Thursday at the Vivian Beaumont Theater at Lincoln Center.

Then the 12-tone Serial score a la Schoenberg struck many potential backers as hopelessly unwhistleable and they withdrew the $8 million budgeted for the production. Fortunately a deaf uncle of the lyricist came through and took up the slack and it was all speed ahead. As for the scoffers who said it would never open, it not only opened at the Imperial Theater, but would also have run for three full performances, were it not for the angry audience uprising that broke out during the third night near the end of Act II.

For the last 23 years a highlight of Out of Doors has been the ROOTS OF AMERICAN MUSIC FESTIVAL, a two-day cornucopia of country, blues, bluegrass and folk. This year the focus is on blues and soul, and though the festival officially begins on Saturday, Friday's show serves as an appropriate prelude.

Kelly       This year, this brilliant singer-songwriter-producer has given us a new album, a new remix collection and -- best of all -- the flabbergasting 12-part operetta ''Trapped in the Closet.'' A few weeks ago Mr. Kelly's body of work expanded yet again, when he sang the national anthem before the Bernard Hopkins-Jermain Taylor boxing match. Mr. Kelly added a light R&B beat perfect for the elegant Chicago dance style known as stepping","excerpt":"between phrases he urged fans to clap along. Without much success, it must be said: the ringside reaction was decidedly unenthusiastic, and the reaction on boxing message boards over the next few days was downright venomous. Boxing fans seemed upset about Mr. Kelly's extreme anthem makeover; surprisingly few seemed grateful that he had turned Francis Scott Key's composition into something you might listen to for fun. (Or maybe that was exactly the problem: maybe an anthem isn't supposed to be any fun.) The video isn't officially available online, though bootleg clips are circulating. Here's hoping this isn't the end of the story: Mr. Kelly (or some unauthorized producer) should rework his remix and release it as an extended single, aimed at making the nation's nightclubs a bit more patriotic.    Stars       This Canadian indie-pop band worked with the director George Vale to create one of the season's best and simplest and wintriest music videos, for their song ''Your Ex-Lover Is Dead.'' (Watch it at cityslang.com.) The video pays tribute to a scene from ''Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind'': the band members lie on their backs, on a bed of ice, gently gesturing at their instruments; the camera hovers above, capturing not only the snow-flecked musicians but also the methodical, ominous progress of the cracks that spread beneath them.    Chrome       This Memphis rapper is the latest protégé of Juicy J and DJ Paul, leaders of Three 6 Mafia; those two are known for creepy electronic beats as well as glassy-eyed rhymes. They produced every track on ''Straight to the Pros'' (Hypnotize Minds), Chrome's sturdy debut album, which sometimes cribs shamelessly -- and well -- from the Three 6 Mafia playbook. ''I Learned,'' with a sleek but woozy beat, echoes the sublime Mafia hit ''Stay Fly''; ''What Cha Need'' has a slow-motion chorus that evokes one of the Mafia's best-known songs, ''Sippin' on Some Syrup.'' Chrome has a thin, spiteful voice; his rhymes aren't intricate but they hit hard, conjuring a vivid sense of desperation. The album ends, inevitably, with an ''Outro'' from the producers, who sound as if they've been celebrating. After a long list of projects scheduled for 2006, we get a disarmingly honest caveat: ''Out of everything I just said, maybe two of those might come out next year.''    The Strokes       To begin the publicity campaign for their third album, ''First Impressions of Earth'' (RCA), the Strokes commissioned a video from Michael Palmieri, who has made videos for Beck and others. David Cross plays a clueless radio jock (he calls the band Stroke), and we hear the song going out over the airwaves, becoming the soundtrack to much semi-anonymous groping. But by the time the label was sending out copies of the video, the credit read ''Alan Smithee'' (the name used when a director refuses to take credit); Mr. Palmieri posted a ''censored director's cut'' on his Web site, michaelpalmieri.com. Elsewhere online, a video remix started circulating; this new version turned the video black and white, and it replaced the groping with scenes swiped from ''Night of the Living Dead,'' to match the song's tense-to-frantic arc. Mr. Palmieri responded, enthusiastically, with a 1,300-word open letter to the remixer (known only as triple--six), explaining his side of the story. If all this was planned, the plan was crafty.    Thomas Brinkmann       Mr. Brinkmann is one of Germany's most rigorous electronica producers. (And that's saying something.) His latest CD, ''Lucky Hands'' (Max Ernst), provides further proof that he would rather perplex his rabid fans than satisfy them. (Can you blame him?) Tracks like ''B-Day'' prove that he can still assemble infinitesimal sounds into surprisingly strong, supple rhythm machines. There are also hit-or-miss collaborations with the Georgian musician Tusia Beridze (including a mysterious version of Morrissey's ''The More You Ignore Me, the Closer I Get''), plus an even bigger surprise: a jaunty album-closing track based on a Django Reinhardt composition.    Faith Hill and Tim McGraw       Since these two country stars are known to their fans as a happy couple, they had no choice: in their perfectly melodramatic new music video, they had to play an unhappy one. The song is ''Like We Never Loved at All,'' a power ballad from Ms. Hill's current album, ''Fireflies'' (Warner Nashville). And in the video, available at www.cmt.com, the current couple play a former couple. Long looks are exchanged; long notes are sung; long tresses are arranged at least three different ways; longevity on the charts is all but assured. Oh, Say, Can You See What R.

His ability, honed in live performance, matched his intent, which was to communicate clearly. And where the other rappers cluttered up their tracks and were often incomprehensible, Mr. Parker's backing tracks, supplied by his brother, Kenny Parker, on turntables, were spare, his vocals clear.

The river runs northeast for nearly 150 miles, separating into two forks to coil around the mighty Massanutten Mountain, then merging near Front Royal, Va., to form a rushing waterway that flows into the Potomac River at Harpers Ferry, W. Va. This is the &#8220;rolling river&#8221; nostalgically recalled in the old folk song, and its bountiful farmland is celebrated in the paintings of Grandma Moses. One of the first to be taken by the beauty of the valley (and its economic promise) was George Washington who, as a young surveyor's apprentice in 1748, noted in his diary that the land is &#8220;exceeding Rich and Fertile all ye way&#8221; and &#8220;produces abundance of Grain, Hemp, Tobacco, etc.&#8221; German and Scotch. Irish settlers moved into the valley from Pennsylvania in the 18th century along the Great Wagon Road. That thoroughfare, originally an old Indian trail, became the strategic Valley Pike, bitterly disputed between the North and South during the Civil War. Now, as U. S. 11, it is lined with. markers commemorating its long history. The landscape today is still one of rustic beauty, a patchwork quilt of apple orchards and cattle pastures, of towering limestone formations and unspoiled national parklands, of country inns and backroads stores. Its small cities &#8212; Winchester, New Market, Harrisonburg and Staunton, founded in the 18th century along the spine of the wagon road&#8212;have grown into industrial centers, but their downtowns, with old stone churches and county courthouses, preserve a sense of continuity with a past.

Before Mr. Mondschein, a 21-year-old college student from Manhattan, was to send the girls and their one honorary boy member into a plot for some old-fashioned digging and planting, he held out a small plant. \\"Smell this,\\" he said to the group. \\"This is basil. It's an herb. Do you know it?\\" No answer. \\"Have you ever had pesto sauce?\\" he continued. \\"Well, it's in that.\\" So began another day on the Urban Farm, an acre of land hard by the Belt Parkway on Rockaway Parkway. At the Seaview Diner next door, patrons can look out not at the sea but at children raking rocks, pulling weeds and patting soil. They used to see stones and a teepee. A group of Mohawk Indians laid claim to the land last year until the Parks Department removed them. Now a leader of the  group, John Crosstheriver, returns to give the children lessons in local Native  American lore. The tract was adopted this spring by New Perspectives, an economic development corporation in Canarsie, with permission from the Parks and Recreation Department. A $12,000 grant from the State Department of Parks paid for the crops, fence and shovels. The parcel had to be cleared of trash and resoiled. The groups of children who do the planting are supervised by senior citizens from two local centers who make sure the novices are planting the harvest of eggplant, tomatoes, basil and peppers properly. The older men and women show concern as they stand over the boys and girls. After all, once the food is grown, New Perspectives plans to feed it to the seniors at the centers. \\"I've desperately wanted to plant stuff for years,\\" said 10-year old Felicia Spano who was holding a pink hand shovel. \\"People should be thinking about plants.\\" Last year, the Mohawk group built an encampment on the land when it was still strewn with rocks and discarded junk. From October until Dec. 31, the men meditated inside a sweat lodge and spent the nights there. Visitors were welcome to learn about their traditions. But the group, which wanted to build a museum there, had a permit to use the site only until the end of the year. They refused to leave after the Parks Department asked them to and the agency tore down the teepee and the lodge. Alan Weisberg, executive director of New Perspectives, said he has tried to include the Mohawks in the farm but they have not informed him of their plans and could not be reached for comment.

Also along, not exactly for the ride, were assorted journalists, François Reichenbach, a French director, with (according to the Warner Brothers publicity sheet) a \\"crack 15-man film crew,\\" and two studio accountants. For this last information I am indebted not to Warner Brothers but to Ron Rosenbaum, a Village Voice reporter, whose eyewitness articles on the caravan make an essential accompaniment to the movie.Led, more or less, by an immense, bearded, deep-voiced, aging disk jockey named Tom Donahue, the caravan set out from San Francisco in silver-painted buses carrying tie-dyed tepees, headed for points east (and eventually, the Isle of Wight) with the intention of giving concerts, confronting middle America, and incidentally making a movie. The movie begins in San Francisco, as, on the sound track, a choir of heavenly voices sings over the head of Tom Donahue in his broadcasting studio. But it ends, a little abruptly, at Antioch College in Ohio, where there was a confrontation, but not the one that had been expected.The ostensible reason for the caravan was, of course, to present concerts. What you see of the concerts seems to have little enough to do with the caravan. For the most part they feature imported big-name talent, B. B. King, Doug Kershaw, etc., and they are treated by Reichenbach as isolated, self-contained events. On the other hand, there are the caravan's \\"events\\": bathing in a giant bowl of Jello prepared by Wavey Gravey and the Hog Farm, pacifying the violent STP Family in Boulder, answering the activists at Antioch.The caravan's real problems came not from middle America, which, according to the evidence on the screen, seemed downright chummy, but from the youthful political left, which, despite a certain amount of camouflage, saw Warner Brothers and smelled a rat. Along the way an activist named David Peel attached himself to the caravan with the purpose of exposing it, and at Antioch there occurred a series of misadventures leading to spur-of-the-moment guerrilla theater, a nontheatrical knife attack on Peel and much violent argument over the not so profitable question of who was bought and who had sold","excerpt":"between the movie company and the counter culture, who was ripping off whom.In a case like this I would normally side against the movie company. The staged documentary is not on the whole an interesting form. But the concluding confrontations very nearly changed my mind, and after 30 seconds of listening to the ravings of an Antioch activist I was almost ready to love Warner Brothers.Movies like \\"Medicine Ball Caravan\\" tend to run to cinematic effect; and for Reichenbach this means heavy reliance on telephoto lens, split screen and a kind of Rorschach-blot doubling of images during the concerts—so that B. B. King's profile duplicates itself and the materialized vibrations of the Cajun Fiddler's fiddle run out of the frame like railroad tracks. None of this is dreadful, but much of it has been seen before, and, like the film's many impromptu interviews with its own people, adds up to no experience.

Paramont's \\"The Joker Is Wild,\\" has Mr. Sinatra portraying his pal, in a frankly affectionate valentine, based on a biography by Art Cohn, with a nice supporting cast that includes Eddie Albert, Mitzi Gaynor and Jeanne Crain.This is the story of a cocky young Prohibition-era singer, almost ruined by a gangster, who switches to comedy, and drinks his way to night-club renown, as two loving ladies lose him to show-business legend.To get right down to cases (along with Mr. Lewis), the valentine is disarmingly personable and realistic for about two-thirds of the way. Sentiment it has—also salt.Unfortunately, and with all respect to Mr. Lewis, a very likable hero, as Mr. Sinatra plays him, he eventually turns into a flabby, tippling night owl vaguely promising to perk up. Methodically tapering off, the picture ends on this indulgently listless note.Backing up, there is plenty to be said for a show-business tribute as trimly organized, well-acted and honest as this one. Mr. Saul has snugly ticket off a series of admirably lean vignettes for Mr. Sinatra that carry him from a bleak Chicago hole-in-the-wall to his present-day club eminence.

Add, certainly, the consistently fine acting of Mr. Sinatra, on view virtually every minute, armed to the hilt with period songs.Mr. Lewis' friend has made him seem such a winning guy, it's too bad we have to leave him methodically wearing a bottle, like a tired albatross.

AND FOR good reason. The designs are not only strong enough to withstand fickle tastes and trends but, more important, they have yet to wear out their welcome as useful domestic objects. Take Jean Puiforcat's Art Deco coffee and tea services: Some styles have been in continuous production at the Paris-based firm since the 1920's. Anything American from the 50's is so popular you would think everyone was still watching black-and-white television and eating TV dinners. And Finnish products from that same decade -- such as the designer Kaj Franck's unadorned pottery -- have been reintroduced and promoted industriously by the manufacturer. In fact, some items, such as the Viennese architect Josef Hoffmann's silver-plated bowl from 1906, have gone into production for the first time in the last decade.   What makes tableware \\"modern\\"?  Developed over the early part of this century, the modernist esthetic emphasized industrial design paired with craftsmanship, simplicity over ornamentation, the newest materials, cost-effective techniques and, above all, functionalism. For the most part, these designs were mass-produced to meet a mass demand for streamlined, utilitarian objects at moderate prices. Today, this tableware is being grabbed up by consumers seeking elegant yet unostentatious pieces for their homes.   \\"People are looking for better values,\\" says Christopher Mount, a curatorial assistant in the architecture and design department of the Museum of Modern Art in New York.    The first modern tableware can be traced back to the 18th century, when Josiah Wedgwood, that pioneer of pottery, had the foresight to ride the tide of the Industrial Revolution and mass-produce earthenware that appealed to the British upper and merchant classes.  The company's motto, freely translated from the Latin, sums up his contribution: \\"I cut through hindrances.\\" Wedgwood's basalt tableware, a simple coal-black design, has been turned out continuously since about 1770, yet it would fit in nicely at any SoHo dinner party today.    Since then, architects, artists and industrial designers have given their own expression to modernist tabletops. The 1906 bowl by Josef Hoffmann was produced for the first time in 1984 by Alessi, the Italian design company, in conjunction with the Boston-based Markuse Corporation. Markuse and Alessi not only see the merit in issuing well-designed tableware but also are responding to collectors obsessed with modernism. As Jack Markuse, the corporation president, explains, \\"Alessi thinks everything is cyclical.\\" (The company also manufactures tableware by such modernists as Christopher Dresser, recognized as Britain's first industrial designer, and Ettore Sottsass, the Italian architect.)   Among the foremost producers of early modernist tableware were the architects and artists of the Bauhaus school in Germany, influential in the 20's. Their aim was to develop functional, technologically advanced designs made of the latest materials. Bauhaus tableware -- curvaceous or determinedly rectilinear, depending on the designer -- is continually being reintroduced. Marianne Brandt's quirky 1924 cocktail shaker, for example, which makes a bell sound when rocked, is an Alessi product. Bauhaus influences are also evident in more recent tableware like TC-100, introduced by Rosenthal U.S.A. in the 1960's. Now in the Museum of Modern Art's permanent collection, this stackable white service is considered a modern classic.    Scandinavian designers, unswerving modernists by birth, transformed free-form, organic shapes into durable and practical glasses, plates and vases.  Some artists, like the Danish jewelry designer and sculptor Henning Koppel, went straight for sensuality. In the mid-50's, Koppel's biomorphic sculptural holloware represented a significant leap forward for the Danish silversmith Georg Jensen, for whom he worked.  Koppel's pear-shaped sterling-silver wine pitcher of 1948 was an almost erotic departure from the company's more florid, conventional designs. In \\"Design 1935-1965: What Modern Was,\\" Toni Lesser Wolf of Le Musee des Arts Decoratifs de Montreal described the pitcher's \\"pregnant belly\\" and neck of \\"undulating curves.\\"    The Finns have tenaciously held on to their large corner of modernism.  The architect Alvar Aalto's famous 1936 vase with undulating sides, titled \\"Eskimo Woman's Leather Breeches,\\" remains a staple of the 113-year-old Iittala company, now a division of Hackman Tabletop of Finland. The industrial designer Tapio Wirkkala's crystal stemware, vases and candleholders, alternately organic and geometric, have been in continuous production at Iittala since 1946. Timo Sarpaneva, a Finnish designer of international renown, makes glasses, cutlery, china and tea and coffee services. His extensive oeuvre is currently the subject of a retrospective at the American Craft Museum in New York. Sarpaneva describes his designs as distinctly Nordic: \\"We love nature. Finland's archipelago and granite rocks are a strong influence. But I don't make strange, curious things.\\"    The Arabia division of Hackman Tabletop has been making ceramic tableware since 1874. One of the company's best-known products is the solid-colored, multiple-use, stackable Kilta earthenware designed by Kaj Franck in 1951. Its austere design made it an international favorite: Some 25 million pieces were sold before Arabia discontinued the line in 1975. It was resurrected by the company under the name Teema in 1981, this time made of stoneware, a more durable material.    Franck's dishes had -- and still have -- a democratic appeal. \\"Lots of young families couldn't afford to buy a whole set, so they bought it piece by piece in different colors,\\" says Christopher Mount of the Museum of Modern Art, which held a Franck retrospective in 1992. The designer was savvy: The Kilta saucer, for example, had no indentation in the center, so that if the cup broke, the saucer could be used as a butter plate.   That democratic, open-stock approach to dinnerware was a modernist theme in American tabletop design as well. Introduced in the 30's, Russel Wright's pottery -- with its fluid forms, soft curves and muted shades -- met a demand for informal service in an increasingly domesticated nation. Brightly colored Fiesta dinnerware was another vibrant presence in dining rooms and kitchens. Both lines offered a mix-and-match dynamic at reasonable prices. Fiesta is still manufactured by the Homer Laughlin China Company, in Newell, W. Va.   In 1982 in New York, Nan Swid and Addie Powell entered the modernist tableware industry by producing high-style but utilitarian pieces designed principally by architects. Swid Powell's vision has been executed by such notable Americans as Robert Venturi and Stanley Tigerman, as well as industrial and fashion designers. One of the company's most prolific contributors is the architect Richard Meier, whose white dinnerware is quintessentially minimalist modern.   Fine artists, too, continue to be attracted to the demands of designing tableware. Among them is the painter Jennifer Bartlett. Desperate to find the right glasses as models for \\"Twelve Noon,\\" one in a series of paintings about daily life shown at the Paula Cooper Gallery in New York last fall, she finally decided to design her own. The cylinder-shaped glasses are now sold by A/D, a SoHo gallery that commissions prominent artists to create domestic objects.   Bartlett's description of her glasses sums up the enduring passion for modernism. \\"There aren't very many decorative elements on them, they aren't making a class statement -- and you don't have to be well-mannered to use them.\\"  Where to buy the products on page 47:    Silver-trimmed glass platter from Anni Glass, $115.

No amount of misguided effort is going to help. It's an easy picture to ridicule; after a while, you almost feel as if the stars are making fun of the movie. Or at least, you'll wish Angelina Jolie — with her radiant presence and Panavision lips — and Clive Owen, with his brisk, existentialist cool were smart enough to do so. After the &quot;Lara Croft: Tomb Raider&quot; movies, with their globe-trotting superficiality and numbing imbecility, Ms. Jolie must feel she owes her fans something serious. Unfortunately, she's starring in a movie even more benumbed and superficial, a liberal video game that demeans the very refugees it tries to spotlight. Her good-heartedness is probably the reason she chose to star in this film about a shallow young woman, Sarah Jordan, who's shaken out of her insular existence by the dashing Dr. Nick Callahan (Mr. Owen). &quot;Borders&quot; wants to dramatize the chasm between Sarah and Nick, whose impatient compassion endangers as many refugees as it saves. That metaphorical land mass is supposed to be her middle-class naiveté and his brooding, no-nonsense altruism. But they're much closer than they think — a pair of noble idiots. Inspired by his example, she raises money and follows him with medical supplies and food to Ethiopia. He repays her kindness with blithe cruelty. They finally tryst; the sweat beads seductively on their skins, while their glamorously gaunt jawlines expel plumes of cigarette smoke. This is a movie so oblivious that Martin Campbell, an accomplished action filmmaker, forgot that in the 1940's &quot;Casablanca&quot; had the good sense to have Rick note that the troubles of two people don't amount to a hill of beans. &quot;Borders&quot; is reminiscent of another 40's classic, the smashingly absurd &quot;Duel in the Sun,&quot; and is as realistic as a recent film based on real incidents: the remake of &quot;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.&quot; — Elvis Mitchell Treating a Troubled World With a Dose of Star Power"},{"year":"1946","title":"Baldwin cited, ed Topics of The Times","excerpt":"Beyond Call of Duty News to the Last When Comment Palls Doomsday Much Exaggerated In to the Melee Too Much Fear"},{"year":"1992","title":"A trusted mayoral adviser is unmasked as an embezzler and begins talking to the District Attorney. The story has a thousand endings, but the elements are familiar -- a whiff of scandal scattered by political winds, rival scoops, tight-lipped lawmen and a public braced for growing revelations.   In the month since Arnold I. Biegen was caught writing himself $158,000 in checks out of the campaign treasury he was collecting for Mayor David N.

The picture, completed shortly before his death, brings to an end the Rogers series","excerpt":"beyond doubt, there will be revivals of his older films, but there is poignance and grief in the realization that there will be no new characterizations, no new plot structures for Mr. Rogers to animate.From the treasure trove of the old Charles T. Dazey melodrama, which first saw the light of Broadway back in Ninety-four and has run through two previous screen editions, Sam Hellman and Gladys Lehman have purloined enough material for a warm, human and jolly comedy. Mr. Rogers has seldom found himself in finer fettle or in more agreeable company. The romance of the younger set never is permitted to interfere with the more comic doings of the oldsters and, for a finish, there is as odd a horse race as ever has been run south of the Mason-Dixon line.\\"In Old Kentucky\\" is, primarily, an account of the feud between the Martingales and the Shattucks. Mr. Rogers, as Steve Tapley, veteran horse trainer, finds himself temporarily on the wrong side of the fence, but eventually joins forces with Nancy Martingale and her grandpa, Ezra Martingale, who is forever toting a shotgun around and taking pot shots at anything and any one resembling Pole Shattuck.The feud is resolved, finally, into the big race between the Martingales' Greyboy and the Shattucks' Emperor, with Greyboy doomed unless it happens to find a muddy track. Enters then one Pluvius J. Aspinwall, rainmaker, with a weird contraption for producing precipitation. The machine fails to work until the day of the race, and even then its workings are so surprising that it would be to deprive you of a chuckle to describe what happens that permits Greyboy to win and the Martingales to foil the bloated Shattucks.With the usual sly Rogers humor, with extremely fine comedy performances by Charles Sellon and Etienne Girardot, with the romantic interest carried gently by Dorothy Wilson and Russell Hardie and with Bill Robinson to tap away the duller moments, \\"In Old Kentucky\\" can be listed as a first-rate comedy and a handsome epitaph to twentieth century America's first humorist.

Whether the \\"boys and girls\\" of the present or the \\"ladies and gentlemen of the  ensemble\\" of earlier times, the corps de ballet has been the motor of 19th-century works like \\"Swan Lake\\" with its fluttering birds and \\"Giselle\\" with its vengeful Wilis, the ghostly spirits who, mesmerized and mesmerizing, invariably draw applause as they travel en masse across the stage. The corps has been there to magnify atmosphere, plot and the architecture and spectacle of the choreography.         But that has changed. No 19th-century choreographer would recognize the corps in modern ballets. Corps dancers are no longer ciphers in ordered rows of uniform bodies that move as one. Now they often perform the same steps as the stars and are recognizably individual. The New York City Ballet, which opens its nine-week spring season on Tuesday in the New York State Theater at Lincoln Center, is the prime example of this change. City Ballet is widely acclaimed for a corps that may not be the neatest but is certainly one of the most exciting anywhere. In its youthful ranks are to be found lead dancers of the future, and  they are routinely plucked from the chorus to take on roles normally danced by the soloists.

This castle is indeed a snug haven, nurturing and protecting its inhabitants from the dusty common traffic of Route 9. Red-curtained picture windows allow only the view from the back: greenwood stands, stream and statuary.\\n\\nFor the last eight years, Mario Di Perna has energetically run this dining room and kitchen, remodeling, buying produce and cooking dishes from his voluminous repertoire of recipes gathered in 55 years of culinary experience that began when he was 15 years old. At ease with his materials, this chef has studded the otherwise classic menu with his own lively inventions, happy farragoes, thoughtfully and clearly explained on the menu's back cover. As is the case with many ''continental'' restaurants, Italian cuisine was responsible for a significant number of entries on the Castle's menu just as, we suspect, the ever-active stock pot at the back of the stove accounted for the richness and freshness of his dishes.

At a Columbia University Law School conference last week on the Bhopal disaster, which killed more than 2,000 people and injured 200,000 others, both Indian and American legal scholars agreed that India's existing legal system creates some barriers to effective justice in India.   The problems most often cited are long delays before trial, up-front filing fees - in some Indian states, an Indian lawyer said, the courts require a claimant to pay 10 percent of the amount requested in the suit - and the lack of contingency arrangements that would let poor victims hire the best lawyers and pay their fees out of the money recovered.    However, the legal experts agreed, the Indian Government could easily solve these problems by creating a special tribunal to hear the Bhopal claims. Already, the Indian lawyers said, the Government was considering waiving the filing fees for poor victims of the Bhopal disaster and providing them with free legal aid in bringing their claims.

Lodges now cost about $150 a day and campsites $120 to $130. In March, May, July, August, September and November, rates range from $175 for hotels to $100 to $120 for campers. Low-season rates for January, February, June and December will be $130 for hotels and $80 to $90 for campsites, with lodges only slightly higher.    While most monasteries will remain closed to foreigners, tourists may be admitted to certain festivals held in monastic-fortress compounds called dzongs.
