And many of them learned from a 19th-century French manual, ''The Art of Drawing,'' by a little-known lithographer and painter, Charles Bargue, and the academic realist Jean-Léon Gérôme. This huge show consists of selected plates from the manual, which Bargue and others painstakingly copied from old master drawings and plaster casts of Greek and Roman statues. Passé as it may appear today, the manual was once a serious tool in the training of artists: van Gogh used it, as did Picasso, and their drawings from it appear here. The manual's wonderfully detailed plates make a formidable spread over several big bays of the museum. But while technically proficient, Bargue's own painting qualifies as high kitsch.

If you wonder what it really means to say that art is a calling, see this ethereal show. A self-appointed prophet and street preacher, Sister Gertrude felt a call by God to paint in the 1950's. Untutored but full of an uncanny grace, her vivid, high-key works have a plain-spoken ecstasy and inborn eloquence, both formal and literary, that can lift the soul. The mix of text and image relates to many modern artists and poets, none of whom she ever heard of or cared about. Her pictures are talismans of mystical devotion derived from inner necessity, conceived as teaching tools for lost souls. In heaven works like these would be eternally before our eyes. The world not being heaven, this is your opportunity to see them. The day has come, as Sister Gertrude might say.

The student, Marc Liby, a graphic design major from Honewood, Ill., and his roommate, Michael Resczenko, a marketing major from Oskaloosa, Iowa, both said that they would continue to try to change a residence-hall policy that they see as unfair.    Mr. Resczenko said he wanted to continue to pursue the issue through university channels, though he said he was not against taking the matter to court.    Mr. Liby, however, said nothing more could be accomplished through the university's judicial system. He said he wanted to get the American Civil Liberties Union to take action, although he has not yet approached the group about his case. The university is \\"denying me my freedom of speech, the basic amendment to the Constitution,\\" he said. No Home to Bigotry      The controversy began in October, when a student resident assistant charged Mr. Resczenko and Mr. Liby with violating anti-bias guidelines in their residence-hall contracts.    The material posted on their door included signs saying, \\"I'm Not Prejudiced Against Gays, I Hate Them All,\\" and \\"AIDS...Anal Inflicted Death Sentence.\\"    The preamble to the residence hall guidelines states: \\"Bigotry and hate will be given no home within our university housing community. While each of us has the right to our own personal beliefs, these beliefs in no way give us the right to denegrate another on the basis of their age, physical handicap, national origin, sexual orientation, race, gender or religious affiliation.\\"    Residence-hall officials contend that the two men specifically violated the rule that states, \\"Pictures and other material that may be considered objectionable are not to be displayed in nonstudent room areas or windows that may be visible outside the student room.\\" 'It's Not Fair'      A university judicial board has found the men guilty, and appeal to another board has been denied. The men had to take down the material and were put on probation, which means that if they violate another university policy, they could be removed from the dormitory.    Barbara Mack, a lawyer and associate professor of journalism, called the residence hall guidelines vague, and said the univeristy was \\"trying to bootstrap the preamble language into disciplinary rules.\\" No punishment was implied in the preamble, she said, contributing to the vagueness of the Iowa State policy.    \\"It's not fair to punish a student for engaging in free speech they couldn't have known violated a university rule,\\" Ms. Mack added.

SHAKESPEARE IN A CASTLE     A stone castle on a hill in Tarrytown will be the setting for readings from Shakespeare by the Phoenix Theater Company of Westchester, tomorrow from 5:30 to 7:30 P.M. The occasion is a benefit for the four- year-old, nonprofit professional summer repertory company based at the Masters School in Dobbs Ferry.   Axe Castle, off Benedict Avenue, was built in the early 1900's by Howard Carroll, a Washington correspondent for The New York Times in the late 1870's businessman, assistant to Governor Levi Morton of New York and an Inspector General in the Spanish-American War. In 1941 the house became the headquarters of Axe-Houghton Financial Management.    Reminiscent of castles in Britain, its tower rises 75 feet, and the dining hall, where the performance will be held, has a rose window and musicians' loft and can comfortably seat 100. The meeting room of paneled oak, where the cocktail reception will be held, was taken from the general's Paris house, once occupied by the deposed King James II of England.    Tickets are $20 and can be purchased at the door or reserved by calling (212) 737-8438.

Mr. Wohabe is a graduate of Cornell Law School, and a member of the bar in Saudi Arabia as well as in the United States. He will focus on business opportunities and investment incentives in Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

indicate that infante who are retarded in certain aspects of development are much more likely to overcome their problem early in life if they are reared in upper socio‐econ family; Dr L Willerman cites study of more than 3,000 white children in Boston that shows that, if child is developmentally advanced in infancy, there is 'no likelihood of his being retarded later in life, even if he grows up in poor soc environment'; says study indicates that for children who are retarded in infancy, likelihood that they will show signs of retardation at age 4 is 7 times greater if family is from low socio‐econ class; Dr H Birch cites study that indicates socio‐econ class can sometimes wipe out deleterious intellectual effects of low birth weight due to prematurity; says child of lower soc class born with low birth weight is much worse off developmentally than normal weight children at school age, while low birth weight children of upper soc classes are no worse off than their normal siblings by time school age is reached; Willerman says environment may also compensate for possible adverse effects on child of complicated obstetrical delivery; cites study that indicates that after difficult delivery, children of lower soc classes have significantly lower IQ scores than children of upper soc classes, but are not affected intellectually when delivery is uncomplicated LEARNING LINKED TO CHILD REARING"},{"year":"2002","title":"Sixteen states and New York City have raised taxes on cigarettes this year, and some smokers are thinking more seriously about quitting in face of higher costs","excerpt":"studies suggest that price increase of 10 percent reduces smoking about 4 percent;
