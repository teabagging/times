In \\"The Real Inspector Hound,\\" he gets even with his former colleagues and with the hazards of the profession. With this devious theatrical comedy, nimbly revived by the Roundabout Theater Company, he kills two critical birds, or in Stoppard parlance, one Birdboot and one Moon. For a playwright, this is a case of character assassination. Clearly Mr. Stoppard had fun writing the play, a pleasure that is shared by his audience. In its time, 1971 Off Broadway, it seemed an amusing trifle. It has ripened into an amusing truffle.   At its root, it is a play on criticism. Moon is a second-string drama critic, an eternal stand-in, always a backup and never a lead singer, a role that he describes in an irate stream of resentment that identifies with all the understudies in life. Whenever Moon goes to the theater, he is affronted by the question, \\"Where's Higgs?\\" The absent Higgs is his newspaper's first-stringer, and the object of Moon's wrath. Birdboot, in contrast, represents critical complacency. A smug sybarite, he is a blurbster, reveling in the fact that one of his reviews has been reproduced in its entirety in neon at the Theater Royal. For him, no favoritism is strong enough to be labeled a conflict of interest.

Yet Mr. Murphy's tales bear little resemblance to the vast majority of families who face state intervention based on charges that they have failed to take proper care of their children. Most of the parents who populate the halls of our country's juvenile courts are not child abusers, but individuals who have been charged with \\"inadequate supervision\\" or \\"environmental neglect,\\" and who have fallen short of society's high standards in their struggle to feed, clothe and house their families on pitifully inadequate resources.

A series of recordings bearing the festival's rubric is being released by Composers Recordings Inc., and the festival has commissioned 12 works. And while Bang on a Can does have a polemical edge that grows out of downtown music, its sixth edition is actually uptown, just a block from Lincoln Center.

In May 1993, after 30 years of fighting, leaders of the Eritrean People's Liberation Front (EPLF) formally declared this small area of north and northeast Ethiopia to be an independent state. Ethiopia, along with the U.S., the Sudan, and several other states, quickly recognized the authority of the new transitional government led by Issaias Afwerki, former head of the liberation movement. During the early 20th century, the region of Eritrea was an outpost of the Italian empire, but it came under British rule during World War II. The British made Eritrea part of Ethiopia when independence was granted in 1952. The secessionist movement began immediately, first against Haile Selassie, then in the 1970's and '80's against the Marxist Mengistu Haile Mariam, who was finally driven from office by other forces in 1991. The new government quickly made peace with the Eritrean rebels, who promised continued access to the sea after independence became a fact. Late in 1995 Eritrea began to contest with Yemen control of Greater Hanish Island at the mouth of the Red Sea, a struggle serious enough to elicit U.N. mediation. Further troubles broke out in May 1998 when a small skirmish over the border with Ethiopia escalated into major military clashes in June. The U.S. was attempting to mediate. The bloody and incomprehensible border war continued, with much loss of life on both sides, into 2000 until June 18 when Eritrean and Ethiopian foreign ministers signed a cease-fire restoring the borders of May 1998. Both countries in April 2002 accepted the Hague Court of Arbitration's definition of the disputed 620-mile border.
