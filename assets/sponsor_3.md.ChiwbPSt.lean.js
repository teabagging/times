Her way of moving is a miraculous mix of simplicity and juiciness, of robustness and delicacy. There is a blunt good humor to the way she presents herself and her resilient body to her audience, her round elf's face brimming with teasing, impudent cheer. But there is also a miracle flow to her dancing, and a gift for deft and telling inflection as subtle as any music. There was a good deal of Trisha Brown's slippery, continuous motion to what she danced on Saturday night at St. Mark's Danspace, unsurprisingly, since Ms. Hultman performed with Ms. Brown for five years. But Ms. Hultman, who is Swedish, has made Ms. Brown's style her own.   She began to speak to the audience as she moved through her 1988 \\"Solo Untitled,\\" a piece without accompaniment that seems simultaneously both the raveling and unraveling of a dance. \\"Yes, I should talk here,\\" she said. \\"But for some reason it feels inappropriate.\\" She continued, however, the end of the dance coming when she announced that she had decided to stop talking. By then, the casual, amiable monologue had begun to sound a little cute. It didn't add much to the solo. But there was the promise of Ms. Hultman's dancing in the balance of the program. And one could go on watching such a dancer with pleasure forever.

By Hollis Alpert. (Knopf, $35.) \\"Porgy and Bess\\" was the result of a uniquely American ethnic mix: music by the son of a Russian-Jewish immigrant, George Gershwin","excerpt":"story by a white Southern aristocrat, DuBose Heyward; direction by an Armenian refugee, Rouben Mamoulian; and a story about the descendants of African slaves. As Hollis Alpert recounts in \\"The Life and Times of Porgy and Bess,\\" Gershwin made a deliberate attempt to marry elements of jazz and blues to traditional European opera. The black performers in the 1935 production, most of them classically trained singers with advanced degrees, felt little kinship with the characters they portrayed. Some critics made fun of the opera's stylistic pretensions; Virgil Thompson called it \\"crooked folklore and halfway opera.\\" Its racial attitudes and strange hybrid form -- something between a Broadway musical and grand opera -- would continue to attract criticism, but subsequent productions have validated the opera's stature. In this engrossing cultural history, illustrated by rarely-seen photos, Mr. Alpert takes us behind the curtain to an elegant evening at Gershwin's, on a tour of Charleston, S.C.'s slums to find the original Catfish Row, and through the exciting auditions and laborious rearrangement of scenes necessitated by each new production. Bringing to life the genius of a unique collaboration, Mr. Alpert, a film critic whose previous books include a biography of the Barrymores, invites us to witness the birth and development of an indigenous musical art.
