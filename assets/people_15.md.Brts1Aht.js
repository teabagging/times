One elderly woman spectator yesterday was frequently moved to explosions of mirth, and although she was unaccompanied, she followed her laughter more than once by uttering:\\"How silly!\\"The plot of this pictorial effort has no relation to that of the original that inspired it. An early chapter is concerned with the reading of a will to four expectant heirs, two spinster aunts and their two nieces. The elderly women hardly relish the news that a flapper niece is bequeathed $10,000 and that the other girl inherits $6,000,000, with the proviso that within three days, she marries a man approved of by the maiden aunts. It therefore behooves the nieces, according to the story, to do their utmost to compromise the aunts. This is accomplished through two men who are flatteringly referred to as \\"lounge lizards.\\" They make a specialty of compromising women who ought to know better.Ann, the heiress to the $6,000,000, is played by Doris Kenyon. Ann has a weakness for Yale students and especially for Gil, the mail clerk in the hotel where she resides. She offers Gil $6,000 if he will marry her, and he is indignant. There is more than a mere suggestion that he admires Ann and would willingly wed her if she did not have the proverbial penny.From the hectic action of this comedy, it might be assumed that Gil is himself compromised, although he never is intoxicated as are the plain-looking spinsters. As time goes on these two aunts become too obstreperous, especially when the nieces are endeavoring to take a flashlight photograph of a giddy scene.Virginia Lee Corbin is amusing as the round-eyed, vivacious flapper. Miss Kenyon is at times more subdued as Ann, but she has her energetic moments. Lloyd Hughes, despite his periods of embarrassment, is capable as Gil. He gives one the idea that the flighty conduct of the other characters and his own awkward predicament is distasteful to Gil. Louise Fazenda and Ethel Wales make facial sacrifices in their clever impersonations of the spinster aunts.Mozart's \\"Magic Flute\\" Sung AgainMozart's \\"Magic Flute,\\" in its German text and its elaborate new dress of Soudeikine's scenic fantasy of seventeen pictures for the current season's Metropolitan revival, was seen and heard a second time at the opera last evening.

Many races remain to be run and won before the Derby on May 4, but some old-fashioned leveling of talent took place this chilly afternoon. Appealing Skier, winner of four of his five starts, raced into the Derby picture as the horse who beat Unbridled's Song in their first start since the Breeders' Cup Juvenile last Oct. 28.

He led four rivals for one mile in the Peter Pan Stakes but then wearied of the battle and surrendered to the less  well-known but faster-closing Jamie's First Punch in the last eighth of a mile.          It would be flip to say that Jamie's First Punch was a haymaker. In reality,  Unbridled's Song was probably a victim of a self-inflicted wound: He was either  overmanaged or undertrained after cracking his left front heel before a fifth-place finish in the Kentucky Derby. After that, he skipped the Preakness and aimed for the Belmont Stakes with the Peter Pan as a prep race. But that route was chosen only after a whirlwind week of second-guessing by his owner, Ernie Paragallo.    HORSE RACING","excerpt":"Unbridled's Song Finds the Right Race.

Paragallo, who announced on Wednesday that he would prefer Monday's Metropolitan Mile against older horses because of its distance and prestige, reversed course on Thursday and opted for the Peter Pan for 3-year-olds at a mile and an eighth.

Then he considered the bad news: A very late snowfall at the end of an interminable winter had just dumped more snow onto the surface. The footing was  so slippery that the track had been closed for training to all horses in the morning and all races had been canceled in the afternoon.

Millions of Bicentennial coins in a special silver version are still gathering dust in federal vaults. What's more, many collectors are unaware that the coins can still be purchased from the Government.\\n\\nTo mark the Bicentennial, Congress authorized issuance of a quarter, half dollar and dollar with suitable commemorative designs. However, it decided that they shouldn't be brand new coins. Instead, it directed the Treasury to use the special designs on the regular-issue coins of those three denominations: the Washington quarter, Kennedy half dollar and Eisenhower dollar. Then it diluted the tribute even more by specifying that only one side of each coin -the reverse - should bear a Bicentennial design. The obverse would carry its regular design, with no distinguishing feature other than the use of double dating (1776-1976).\\n\\nThe three designs were chosen in an open competition that attracted nearly 900 entries. For the quarter, the judges selected a depiction of a Colonial drummer boy. For the half dollar, they picked a stylized portrait of Independence Hall.

In North Jersey, it's almost impossible to get the real thing, because fast-food chains like Popeyes and KFC have established a near monopoly. Only a few independently owned restaurants have dared encroach on that competitive turf. One such outpost on the front lines in the fight for Fried Chicken Independence is the recently opened Uncle Jo's Chicken, a small takeout in Cliffside Park. Unlike his competition, however, Jo Hahn has a secret weapon: He is Korean.      Mr. Hahn, a 20-year veteran of the restaurant industry, really knows his chicken. He starts off with large premium birds that have never been frozen, brines them for an entire day, coats them with flour and his secret seasoning blend, then deep-fries them until golden brown. It sounds simple, but the end result is much bigger than the sum of its parts: juicy, garlicky, with lots of black pepper.

These scenes are so absorbing that they take precedence over the lurid pictorial story. They are something at which to marvel. The airplanes are like silver-birds on the wing, forging through the air in a wonderfully exact formation. They roll and turn as one machine, the pilots being apparently as much at home in the clouds as cavalrymen on terra firma. And although there have been seen on the screen World War air duels and various other exciting airplane activities, nothing quite as stirring or as beautiful as some of these scenes has so far been pictured in animated photography.This narrative, like \\"The Air Circus,\\" gives an opportunity to trace a budding flier until he blossoms out into a full-fledged pilot. \\"The Flying Fleet,\\" however, has the distinct advantage of dealing with the United States Navy and of having had the cooperation of that fighting arm. The story was written by Lieut. Commander Frank Wead, U. S. N., and Byron Morgan, and it is evident that the hand of an expert in flying has helped matters considerably in making this film.The story is sometimes quite a bit too melodramatic, but it is acceptable as it helps to show the metal of the naval fliers. Ramon Novarro, a young actor who is immensely popular, has been cast in the stellar role. Ralph Graves, who did so well in \\"Submarine,\\" rivals Novarro in acting, even though he does not win the blonde beauty or the medal for valor.There is one rather unfortunate subtitle in which one of the characters is made to say that he wants to be a flier and not \\"be just in the navy.\\" But this is only inserted, undoubtedly, to show the eagerness of the young men to become naval air pilots.At first the yarn deals with five friends who have been shoulder to shoulder during the four years at Annapolis. To them there is nothing but the navy of the skies and they all decide to try for it. There are various contretemps, and one of the pals, through poor eyesight, finds that he can't be a pilot, but that he can qualify as a navigator. Then, of course, there is Anita Hastings, with whom both Tommy (Mr. Novarro) and Steve (Mr. Graves) fall head over heels in love.Tommy is the keen one of the lot. But just when he has the chance to fly a plane in a trans-Pacific flight he gets into trouble and the opportunity goes to Steve.Steve \\"crashes\\" far out at sea and he and the other occupants of the plane are perceived clinging to a wing of the wreck. It is Tommy who eventually discovers his pals, and just as he is about to speed to his friends his gasoline tank springs a leak. Nothing daunted, Tommy fires a pistol into the tank, which sets the machine afire and thus attracts attention aboard the airplane carrier. Tommy saves himself by parachuting to the sea. These ruddy scenes are saved by their excellent photography, and also the stirring sight of a parachute descending and alighting on the water but a short distance from Steve and the wrecked crew.The passage where Tommy is scanning the sea for his friends, and where he finally sights the men on the airplane wing, elicited applause yesterday afternoon, and still louder was the clapping when all were saved.There are some splendid sequences devoted to an airplane carrier, with its marvelous deck space and the gull-like machines gliding from the vessel and swooping back home.There is in most cases a certain dignity given to the rôles, particularly the portrayal of the Admiral by Alfred Allen. His good-natured sternness reacted as comedy, for when one of his officers stopped smiling because he caught the Admiral's eye, the audience burst into vociferous mirth.Anita Page is attractive as the girl in the case. Gardner James is capital as \\"Specs,\\" the short-sighted navigator.

He has refused to stand pat, forcing himself and us along with him to explore some fairly rough emotional territory, whether it is the American psyche or his own anguished condition.         This gives his exhibition its poignancy. The show includes about 150 photographs and two dozen films and videos that trace his restless trajectory. Born in 1924, Mr. Frank started to take photographs in his native Switzerland in the 1940's, moved to America in 1947, switched from photography to films beginning in the late 50's, then returned to photography in the 70's, though to  a sort of photography very different from his earlier work: it has sometimes come to resemble sculpture, considering how much Mr. Frank has embellished and elaborated on his prints.

Somewhat later, atter we know the characters, it devotes such close attention to fragments of human anatomy that it seems at times to be recalling those \\"geography of the body\\" movies that in provincial film societies used to substitute for art (and sex).But much later, after the hero and heroine have married and settled down to her pregnancy, the area of vision has widened to include rarely less than a bed, a body, or a corner of a cozy apartment. And it becomes apparent that Ake Falck's \\"A Time in the Sun,\\" which opened yesterday at the Carnegie Hall Cinema, has a visual program, a pleasant one, to match its decently sentimental story.The story concerns a handsome, successful young writer who meets a lovely young nurse who is dying of Hodgkin's disease. He marries her anyway, and gets her pregnant—whereupon she has both the baby and a complete reversal of the symptoms of her illness. Such a story, though in this case based on fact, pertains more to fantasy than to fiction. The film is wholly aware of its fantastic potential (the writer calls the girl his \\"princess\\"), and it is just as aware of each exploitable turn in its tale of suffering and success.As with most women's pictures (a genre I highly admire), there is a fair blend of agony and ecstasy in \\"A Time in the Sun.\\" But as with most women's pictures, the ecstasy is chiefly agony, and in health as in sickness the heroine has a pretty sloppy time of it.The misery of Hodgkin's disease and the radiation treatments (nausea","excerpt":"uncontrollable itching) is matched by the pain and anxiety of childbirth. The film stays close to both, but it exploits neither. Indeed, it understands the process of physical recovery as being an escape from the body's tyranny.Thus, the kinds of detail Falck chooses to photograph change as the characters' frames of reference change. He is especially good at figuring intimacy in terms of the camera's space (husband and wife virtually lean into the frame during their happy marriage idyl, and that frame closely defines the limits of their world). But he is especially bad at opening his film up, and two such sequences, a dance at the beginning and the new father's outdoor exaltation near the end, almost nullify the stylish discipline of the rest.But \\"A Time in the Sun\\" is really interesting only for its female lead. Grynet Molvig, a 28-year-old Norwegian pop singer whom I have not seen before, plays the afflicted girl with such intelligent, restrained, sustained directness that she achieves a performance of unusual excitement, which is totally in the service of her characterization. An attractive, unglamorous blond who looks a little like the late, wonderful Nicole Berger (\\"Shoot the Piano Player.\\" \\"Story of a Three Day Pass\\"), Miss Molvig wholly avoids tricks or easy appeals to sympathy—in a role that might have invited both. Her qualities suggest a thoroughly understood humanity, and they make me feel good about the profes-of acting.

National Notes"},{"year":"2005","title":"In her latest salvo against Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney, his Democratic primary opponent, Leslie Crocker Snyder, unveiled a new advertisement yesterday that contends that his office thwarted efforts to change the Rockefeller-era drug laws. These laws, enacted in 1973, impose long mandatory prison sentences on anyone, even a first-time offender, who is caught with a certain amount of drugs. Last year, the State Legislature reduced the minimum sentences for drug offenders. It also allowed those who had been convicted of the most serious felonies and sentenced to the longest prison terms to ask a judge for a new sentence. The commercial, called ''Anonymous,'' is running on Time Warner Cable.    PRODUCER -- Jason McNaboe.    ON THE SCREEN -- A crossing signal displays the ''Walk'' icon (a little white stick figure), then changes to the ''Don't Walk'' icon (a red hand). White lettering on a black background says, ''Thousands of New Yorkers are locked up unfairly due to the Rockefeller drug laws. Who is accountable for the slow pace of reform?'' Against a red curtain, a dark figure appears, with his face blacked out like a secret informer on a television newsmagazine. He is identified as ''Anonymous''","excerpt":"under a red line are the words, ''High-Ranking N.Y. Law Enforcement Official.'' The ad ends with a jerky, blurry shot of Mr. Morgenthau and the words ''After 30 years, it's time to hold him accountable.''    THE SCRIPT -- In an electronically altered voice, the mystery man on the screen says: ''I'm a high-ranking law enforcement official in New York State. I view it as my responsibility to report the facts of what took place at meetings where a representative of Mr. Morgenthau's office was instrumental in opposing Rockefeller drug reform. Robert Morgenthau's office, through his representative, Kristine Hamann, was a key part of that effort.''    ACCURACY -- Until last year, Mr. Morgenthau's office was not in the vanguard of those trying to change the Rockefeller drug laws -- but neither were any of the 61 other district attorneys' offices. (Their state association opposed most proposals to loosen the laws as recently as 2002.) Indeed, many politicians began to pay attention to the issue only after the Albany County district attorney was defeated in 2004 in large part because of his support for the Rockefeller laws. While Mr. Morgenthau is influential in Albany, it seems a stretch to blame him for the persistence of these laws.      The mystery man spoke to a reporter on the condition that his name not be revealed, because people in his position are not supposed to be involved in politics. He is indeed a high-level official in the criminal justice system. Ms. Hamann, whom he mentions, has long been Mr. Morgenthau's legislative liaison. But her reported opposition to changing the laws is hard to evaluate without information about when the meetings occurred and what the proposals in question were.    SCORECARD -- The Rockefeller laws are highly unpopular in many areas of New York; a poll commissioned by Ms. Snyder before her campaign began (and before the Legislature changed the laws last year) found that changing the laws was a potent issue among voters. But like Mr. Morgenthau, Ms. Snyder could be accused of being a Johnny-come-lately to this issue. In her autobiography, published in 2002, she writes that the Rockefeller laws ''are not necessarily as draconian as their opponents describe them.''
