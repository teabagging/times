She recently had a tough week. One day, she went to the aid of a neighbor whose son had been shot. Next, she pleaded with the leader of the gang in her building to hold off seeking revenge for the beating of a member -- she didn't want any shooting to start while children were coming home from school. The next day, she comforted the mother of a 14-year-old girl who had been shot in the head.\\n\\nHousing authorities nationwide have recognized that we will get a handle on violence only when we stop looking at projects as warehouses for the poor and start turning them into neighborhoods. But that is impossible when society's interest extends no further than protecting the freedom from unreasonable search and seizure -- a freedom that is an abstraction to parents who so fear stray bullets that they put their children to bed in a bathtub every night.\\n\\nNo one thinks police sweeps are the final answer. Everyone recognizes that getting a handle on the issue will involve tenant participation in managing and patrolling buildings. Many housing authorities are starting community policing efforts and focusing social service programs on particularly troubled projects. \\n\\nMany people, particularly Henry G. Cisneros, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, are saying high-rises should be torn down and replaced with low-rises or scattered-site housing. All this takes time and money that isn't always available. And it is hard to encourage people to act like neighbors when they're afraid to leave their apartments.\\n\\nFor now, the Chicago sweeps should at least clear away some fear -- sending the message that the authority hasn't abandoned the buildings and instilling some self-reliance and a recognition that a better way of life is possible. Plenty of Chicago Housing Authority residents will tell you that the day after a police sweep they feel freer than they have in a long time. There may be alternatives that accomplish the same purpose without running into constitutional issues. But if all we can summon the will to do is to tut-tut about excesses of authority, we will never find them.\\n\\nUntil we can look Brenda Bolden in the eye and say, \\"This will make your life better,\\" it is unprincipled to condemn people like those in the Chicago Housing Authority who have honestly been trying to do so.

That shortened the distance electrons must travel. Then, chip designers started to make their wares resemble high-rise apartment buildings. Layers of circuitry were stacked on each other, cutting distances even further.

After 315 years, Racine's tragedy about the ancient Greek queen Phaedra retains an emotional and intellectual power that sends one away from a performance personally troubled. And the Pearl Theater Company's production of a version by the British actress Margaret Rawlings is a reminder that this great work of France's greatest tragedian can even survive translation from magnificent 17th-century couplets into simple modern English, and a performance that deliberately avoids the grand declamatory style of classic French theater.

For his version at the Pearl Theater, Shepherd Sobel makes some deep cuts -- principally in the chants of the chorus -- and emphasizes the relentless grinding-down of the widowed and enslaved Trojan women. His production lasts 90 minutes and leaves one feeling hammered. People who know the original will miss some of the sweeping choral odes; their meaning is often murky, but they give the play a slow, majestic rhythm that heightens the terror.

A press release said \\"Emanating the Essence,\\" to recorded music of Brahms, had been inspired by the rapport between Graham and the dance photographer Barbara Morgan.

A sonata theme announces itself at the start of a movement, defining and governing the music to come. By contrast, North Indian Hindustani classical music seems diffident to a Western ear. A raga begins with a slow prelude, the alap, in which an improviser seems to pull wisps and fancies from the air, following musical impulses. Later, the raga acquires a steady rhythm, reveals its melodic contours and displays the performer's flashier side, all dependent on spontaneous inspiration. It is an ancient tradition of music for the moment.    The raga itself is not a fixed composition to be recited, but a certain scale or mode, a set of melodic gestures, a rhythmic cycle and a mood. If the soloist happens to break a string, as Ustad Ali Akbar Khan did during his concert at Alice Tully Hall on Friday night, the music continues while he changes it. Mr. Khan simply cued a solo for his collaborator, Swapan Chaudhuri, on tabla drums.

Perhaps without knowing the hobby implications, commuters in the Los Angeles area are already using another set of numismatic commemoratives: a series of 24 transportation tokens bearing Olympic designs. The tokens, which went into use on Jan. 1, are more than just a means of calling public attention to the Games. They also are raising funds to help finance the huge cost of public transit associated with this summer's extravaganza. The tokens, made of brass, are being sold to commuters for 50 cents apiece---their value as bus fare---by the Southern California Rapid Transit District. However, they also are being marketed in uncirculated sets at a substantial premium, and proceeds from such sales are expected to provide the transit district with upwards of $1.7 million---enough to close the deficit it is likely to incur during the Games. Issuance of the tokens was the brainchild of Robert G. Hennkens, president of the Marketcom Group, a marketing organization in St. Louis. Mr. Hennkens had learned that because of the added transit service required during the Olympics, necessitating the acquisition of hundreds of extra buses and the hiring of hundreds of extra drivers, the Southern California RTD faced the prospect of a multimillion-dollar operating loss. It's anticipated that transportation of Olympic athletes, officials and visitors will require a fleet of 475 vehicles. Mr.Hennkens convinced transit officials that by issuing special tokens and selling them at a premium to collectors, they could close their budget gap in a relatively painless way and also reap promotional advantages.

Certainly, rock's reform era has some benefits: blatant misogyny is on the downswing, and ethical behavior is in. But there's something sad about the demise of outrageousness. When bands like the New York Dolls and T. Rex, KISS and Cheap Trick wowed 70's fans with comic-book flash and bad-boy attitude, rock usurped the dominant ideology with a casual shake of the tail feathers. These bands played rudely constructed songs with a basic pop flair and never acted as if they deserved anything more than their share of fun.

In their haste to turn their profit, the new owners all too often have intimidated, beaten, burned, frozen and otherwise forced their tenants - many of them elderly and ill, paying rents under $50 a week from their Social Security checks - out of the buildings. The city for a long time lacked a policy (it is just now stepping in too late with too little) and in fact spurred this despicable behavior by granting ''conversion'' abatements to new owners so that ''gentrification'' would take place for the affluent.

Beset by recession and the fallout from the Persian Gulf war, airlines on average filled 63 percent of their seats in the first 10 months of 1991, according to the Air Transport Association. Hotels fared no better, with occupancy averaging 62.3 percent through November of 1991, according to Smith Travel Research.
