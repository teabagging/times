The city will be the urban core of a much broader area known as Kapolei. A master plan of the region includes developing more than 40,000 houses, a resort, a harbor and a 900-acre business and light industrial park.    The project, spearheaded by the Estate of James Campbell, will cover 32,000 acres. During the next 18 months, the estate plans to spend at least $75 million on three major projects: infrastructure for the city, the first phase of the shopping center and the Campbell office block -- two three-story buildings with a total of 121,000 square feet of space with the estate's headquarters as a tenant.    Already, about 11,000 homes have been built in the region, and nearly 1,000 are under construction. At least eight developers, plus this city and the state, are involved in building homes.    The 890-acre city of Kapolei will be a city of parks, with a lake and a landscaped corridor alongside a river that will include shade trees, extensive landscaping and fountains. The primary park will encompass a dormant volcanic cone, Pu'u O Kapolei, which once was used as a pilot hill to mark one of three east-west routes across Oahu.    The city will be split into \\"old town\\" and \\"new town\\" districts. The old town district will have buildings two to three stories high, similar to the designs of the late 1800's, with small shops and ethnic restaurants at ground level and small offices above.   The new town district will be the high density core of the community, with office towers such as the Campbell office block, a state office building and a city civic center, and shops and restaurants. There will also be mixed use areas, which will include restaurants, stores and entertainment and community facilities. These will be medium density areas with buildings limited to a maximum of six stories.    The population in the region, which last year was designated Oahu's secondary urban center, is projected to increase to 118,000 to 133,000 by 2010 from 39,000 last year.    The Estate of James Campbell was created in 1900 to administer Campbell's assets, which have grown to more than $1.22 billion. In 1877, Campbell, a sugar-cane pioneer on Maui, bought 41,000 acres in west Oahu for $95,000, and the 32,000 acres for the Kapolei master community come from that parcel.

Many heroines in many movies have been brought to the point of committing justifiable homicide, but until little Mrs. Smith in Mr. West's \\"Nobody,\\" at the Strand this week, came along, not one of them got her man. Usually, just at the moment when a heroine is about to shoot or stab the villain, a bolt of lightning on a man concealed behind the curtains, or some other opportune avenger, beats her to it, so that the desired death of the villain is accomplished without making it necessary for the heroine to stain her hands. The movie fans, you know, are not supposed to like a heroine with bloodstained hands, even if the circumstances are such that any jury would acquit her, even a jury of women. But this is all changed now. Just like Frankie, Mr. West's heroine gets the man who \\"done her wrong.\\" There's that much in her favor, at any rate.What all the shootin's for is another matter. The picture is one of those puzzle plot affairs, in which the spectator is invited to pick his murderer, with the odds that he will guess wrong, because up to the last minute the evidence is about equally distributed among four people, any one of whom can be revealed as the person who fired the fatal shot without any revision of the preceding events. It's Just a matter of guessing.Now, \\"Nobody\\" as a short story, or, perhaps, as a play, might be made effective. A skilful writer could no doubt throw such a verbal glamour over its structure of improbabilities as to make it seem substantial and, for the moment, sufficiently likely to be interesting. But on the screen, with its continual dependence upon words and the merciless exposure of its skeleton by literal pictures, the story never becomes convincing. It's clearly a consciously fabricated piece all the way through.And it isn't helped by the acting. Jewel Carmen, in the leading r√¥le, gives the impression of silliness when she is trying to appear innocent and cute in the early reels, and later, when she is supposed to be deeply emotional, she merely looks like a pretty girl doing what the director tells her to. Kenneth Harlan, as her husband, gives a sincere and, on the whole, acceptable performance, and William Davidson, as the murdered man, fits his part, but they are strikingly good only in separate scenes here and there, and illumine only a small part of the production.The cinematographic devices that might have been used to vivify the story have not been called into service.\\"The Fall Guy,\\" with Larry Semon, is the comedy at the Strand, and the pictorial program also includes \\"The Fox,\\" one of the series of \\"The Adventures of Bill and Bob.\\" The principal musical numbers are Liszt's \\"Second Hungarian Rhapsody,\\" with piano cadenza by George Halprin","excerpt":"Spaeth's \\"Come to the Sea!\\" sung by Carlo Ferretti, and Sanderson's \\"Spring's Awakening,\\" sung by Lottice Howell.\\"The Great Moment,\\" Elinor Glyn's first story written directly for the screen, is at the Rivoli this week. There are rumors that Miss Glyn's scenario underwent some gentle modification in the Lasky studio in Hollywood, and perhaps, with Governor Miller's censorial triumvirate about to take an interest in pictures, it was thought advisable to send the film to the cutting room after the picture's completion. At any rate, the \\"moment\\" is not particularly \\"great,\\" even by comparison with the many lesser moments that make up the hour or more that the story runs‚Äîor walks.Presumably the \\"moment\\" is supposed to come when the hero and heroine, having become lost in the mountains, are alone at the former's cabin. Woman's old enemy, the snake, starts things. He bites the heroine on the shoulder, and there's nothing for the hero to do but cut out the wound with his knife, suck the blood away, and then carry the heroine into his cabin to administer large doses of anti-Volstead medicine to her. Now, the heroine is engaged to another man, and when her father finds her in the cabin he is naturally upset. He does not know anything about the snake or the whisky, and he tells the man that he must marry his daughter at once. Of course the hero might have put him straight by saying, \\"A rattlesnake bit her,\\" or \\"Can't you see she's soused?\\" but he doesn't do anything as non-fictional as that. He just says, \\"You are making a terrible mistake,\\" which, of course, the father doesn't believe, and the marriage ceremony is performed. Then, for good and sufficient reasons, good and sufficient in the movies, anyhow, it is annulled; the heroine becomes engaged to another man, who gives her such parties as the fans are said to dote on, and finally everything is straightened out, as it might have been before the story was two reels old.The character of the heroine is counted on, apparently, to give vitality to the photoplay. Her mother was a wild Russian gypsy and her father is Sir Edward Pelham of England. Although Sir Edward found her mother attractive, he attempts to raise his daughter as a proper English girl, but finds it more than he can do. The mother's blood is too strong in her. She hasn't, as you might say, the Pelham manner. And it's all because of this that there is a photoplay.However, so many incredible things happen, and the action is imbedded in such an artificial setting, that the story creates no illusion. Neither Miss Glyn nor Sam Wood, who directed the production, has been able to conceal the obvious effort of the piece to be sensational. And it doesn't succeed in being sensational, either.Gloria Swanson, an actress eminently capable in some r√¥les, does not fit into her part as the half-gypsy daughter. She never seems the wild young thing she is supposed to be. She shocked Pelham, but certainly she would have been as strange to real gypsies. Alec B. Francis, as her father, is sincere, as usual, and Milton Sills, as the true hero, has the face and figure to be impressive, but one does not get any special impression from his performance.Pictorially the photoplay cannot make any claim to distinction. Some of its scenes are elaborate, but in this extravagant day they are not at all astonishing.\\"Teaching the Teacher,\\" with Snub Pollard, is the comedy at the Rivoli, and the musical program includes Tschaikowsky's \\"Concerto, First Movement,\\" with the Ampico reproducing piano, as an overture, and Ponn's\\" Sunrise and You,\\" sung by Zila Simpson and Carlo Enciso.\\"Don't Neglect Your Wife,\\" based on Gertrude Atherton's first story for the screen, is the photoplay at the Capitol, and \\"The Mystery Road,\\" a British-made Paramount picture, with David Powell in the leading r√¥le, is at the Rialto. \\"New York, the Magnificent,\\" a scenic made by Charles Sheeler and Paul Strand, is also at the latter theatre.

Even the hot young chefs are at their most thrilling when they \\"interpret\\" (as they call it) the traditional dishes of the surrounding Lazio region. Foreign restaurants, though no longer countable only on the fingers, are still largely ignored by both the public and, it is my impression, other restaurateurs. One way to satisfy the yen for something a little different is to go to a restaurant serving the cuisine of another region of Italy. Dal Bolognese    Bologna is to Italian food more or less what Stratford-upon-Avon is to English literature. The Emilia-Romagna region, of which Bologna is the capital, is the home of Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese and prosciutto di Parma, spinach pasta, tortellini, fabulous sausages and meat sauces that are made of meat, not tomato.    The challenge for a restaurant is basically just not to make any mistakes or to let the classic turn stale.   It was the lasagne verdi at Dal Bolognese that made me fall in love with Italian food some 20 years ago. (At least it was what led me to buy the first book by Marcella Hazan, a native of Emilia-Romagna, after which there was no going back.) When I returned last month, lasagne verdi was still on the menu and still inspiring.    The pasta was lightly flecked with spinach, the bechamel unobtrusive, and together they provided a squishy cushion for the tender little chunks of meat (not ground meat) suspended in a sauce that showed no visible tomato.    The Parmesan cheese was grated, as it should be, directly onto the plate. But my companion's tagliatelle al ragu -- plain egg noodles with the same meat sauce and plenty of Parmesan -- was, in its bold simplicity, even better than the lasagne.   The decor of Dal Bolognese is classic and clubby, and the address, on historic, high-rent Piazza del Popolo, tells you right off to expect customers as rich as the food.    On a recent Sunday at lunch -- the most hectic meal of the week in Italy -- the place was full of show people and cashmere-and-pearls perfect families, clearly regulars.   In such circumstances, in Rome, faces not known from either the neighborhood or the screen are often ignored. But the service was professional beyond the call of duty.    No sooner had my snobbish Italian companion raised one eyebrow to make a crack about how Americans would enjoy the sparkling Lambrusco, than our waiter was at his elbow offering to change the wine if he didn't like it.   We kept the Lambrusco, a light, regional red, to accompany his gran bollito misto, the restaurant's -- and the region's -- piece de resistance, and what practically everybody there was eating. This assortment of boiled meats is served from a special cart (carrello) that keeps them warm in their various broths.    The meats are presented with, as condiments, tubs of green sauce and \\"mostarda,\\" a fascinating fruit preserve typical, in many variations, of the northern regions of Italy.   The meats include (in the proportions the diner requests) beef, tongue, fowl, cotechino sausage, and, by rights, veal head, but when my companion asked for the latter, all that was left was a bit of ear.   My polpettone alla bolognese, two slices of a light meatloaf baked around a hard-boiled egg and served with mashed potatoes (pure in Italian) was less of a production but quite nice. The menu includes some cold dishes and simple grilled meats, so that you can get away with eating less than 3,000 calories, but there's no point in ordering anything other than regional specialties.   For antipasto, the best choice is a plate of unadorned culatello di Zibello, a delicate prosciutto-like specialty of Parma considered the aristocrat of Italian cold cuts and uncommon in Rome.   The homemade desserts, after an encounter with the carrello, seemed less appealing than something smooth and slippery, like creme caramel or sorbetto. Il Drappo   Admittedly the idea of a chi-chi Sardinian restaurant gives pause.    The region is one of Italy's poorest and most rugged, and away from the coast, its cuisine is that of the shepherds of the mountainous hinterland, which runs to grilled sheep innards -- definitely not on the menu at Il Drappo.    But the owner-chefs, Paolo and Valentina Tonu, are Sardinian brother and sister and the menu is built around island ingredients and themes, with delicious results.    And the particularly interesting breadbasket contains the typically Sardinian flat, brittle bread known as carta da musica (music paper).   The system at Il Drappo is the fixed-price meal, beginning with an antipasto of diced tomatoes on crunchy thin bread (you have to use both fork and fingers) plus tiny pizzas and some other tidbit, which on our recent visit was fritters with salady stuff inside.    The wine is the house Sardinian red or white.   The first courses change frequently but always offer at least one soup (lentil at our recent dinner) and an ample choice of pastas, usually with seafood or vegetarian sauces. We tried fettuccine with cozze (mussels) and vongole (clams) in a light, but very piquant, tomato sauce","excerpt":"spaghetti with chicory and bottarga (dried mullet roe), and spaghetti in a sauce of nero di seppia (cuttlefish ink).    All were wonderful, but the spaghetti with bottarga -- a specialty of Sardinia -- was sublime.   The main course offerings always include both meat and fish, usually in labor-intensive preparations, a welcome change in Rome. Our roast baby pork (maialino), however, was quite simple and classically Sardinian; the peppers stuffed with artichokes were less orthodox and more typically Drappo.   On another occasion, we enjoyed the grilled, stuffed squid, though the meatballs were a bit boring (both were offered on our most recent visit).   Dessert is seadas, dough filled with white cheese, then fried and topped with bitter honey. It's typically Sardinian, and very good. A chilled glass of Sardinian grappa or the much tamer bilberry liqueur called \\"mirto\\" finishes the meal.   Some people find the decor -- billowing draperies on the ceiling, Sardinian cork in the place of wood paneling -- too precious, but the waiter, Mario Bergantilli, manages to convey the true spirit of the place: the only thing you should take seriously is cleaning your plate. Tavola d'Oro   The only full-fledged Sicilian restaurant in Rome (though a handful of others serve Sicilian dishes) is a hole in the wall that becomes unbearably smoky and unmanageable when crowded, which is usually.   But a friend and I were there when it opened at 7:30 one recent evening, and enjoyed reasonable service, including the attention of the proprietor, Elisabetta Esposito.   In any case, one doesn't go there for the ambiance; one goes in spite of it, for the food.   Caponata, that wonderful Sicilian concoction based on eggplant, tomato, onion, and celery, is easier to find in New York than in Rome, so our antipasto Siciliano -- caponata, marinated zucchini, black and green olives, and roasted sweet peppers -- was sheer bliss.   The pasta offerings include the archetypal Sicilian preparation -- called alla Norma, after Bellini's opera -- with a tomato and eggplant sauce over little shells and ricotta salata grated on top; bucatini with sardines (also de rigueur); and short pasta, like penne, with broccoli (actually the pale-green cross between the cauliflower and broccoli appearing in American markets as \\"broccoflower\\") and caciocavallo cheese.   The most interesting main dishes are involtini (roll-ups) of eggplant stuffed with ground meat and the typical bistecca alla palermitana, a breaded veal cutlet baked, not fried, and large enough to share. The crespelle -- great hulking fritters, one filled with ricotta and the other with anchovies -- were too heavy.   Anyone who is able to continue can finish with a ricotta-filled cannolo -- the Sicilian dessert par excellence. Al Brigante Crocco    About 10 minutes' taxi ride from the center of town is a restaurant representing Italy's most depressed region, Basilicata, or Lucania (an archaic name), which is in the middle of the south, between Puglia on the east and Campania and Calabria on the west.    The region has almost no seacoast, and the dominant flavors of Basilicata are animal, dairy and vegetable.   This restaurant, whimsically named for a 19th-century brigand, is a cozy little spot that makes some effort to evoke its origins in its decor, which includes pottery dishes and hanging antique pistols.   The menu is strongest in the early courses. The antipasto consists of a plate of salamis and a plate of marinated eggplant, olives, mushrooms and the exotic lampascione, which looks like a small onion but has a bitter taste all its own. There was a good mushroom and potato soup on recent visit, but the homemade pastas, orecchiette (\\"little ears\\") and strascinati (flat disks of pasta about the size of a 50-cent piece), are the whole point of going to a Lucanian restaurant.   We found the orecchiette con cime di rape (broccoletti in Rome, broccoli rape in New York) a bit thin and flat (but then I found it insipid homemade in Basilicata too), especially in comparison with Tavola d'Oro's richer version. But there was nothing insipid about the superb strascinati with a strong tomato sauce, eggplant, and pecorino cheese. The rabbit with olives and the meatballs were uninteresting; neither satisfied the urge for the exotic that had taken us to the restaurant in the first place.    We might have done better with the baked baccala (salt cod), the only fish on the menu.    The carafe wine, an Aglianico (the inevitable red of Basilicata), was terrible. We eventually asked for a bottle (also Aglianico), which was decent, but we were charged for both.   The restaurant seats 45, which was about 35 more than it could handle on a Saturday night.

It also seems that Spain, like much of Europe, is nervous about the prospect. In contrast to the United States experience, where broadcasting developed within the general context of a free marketplace and commercial interests, the European systems have evolved much more cautiously under varying degrees of government control. Understandably, many of those governments are not anxious to diminish that control.\\n\\nThe Barcelona conference was coordinated by Antonio Mercader, a prominent figure in video circles, for the Institute of North American Studies, a nonprofit center founded in 1952. Housed in a seven-story building, the institute presents plays, concerts, films and art exhibits by U.S. and local painters. Its main business and source of income, however, is the teaching of English to about 20,000 students each year. With John S.

A3    Sensitive Talks in China  The continuing test of wills between China and Taiwan will enter a new phase on Wednesday with the first high-level contact in five years between the two sides.

He must serve two very different constituencies: the 6.6 million people of Hong Kong and the Communist bosses in Beijing.

A10    Fortune Is Linked to Drugs  Investigators in Switzerland say in a secret report that although some of a huge hidden fortune that belonged to Raul Salinas de Gortari, a brother of Mexico's former President, did come from executives, as he has said, much of it was drug money that he had laundered with help from an old friend who is one of Mexico's richest figures.   A10      NATIONAL   A12-16    A New Genetic Database Raises Hopes and Fears  The Federal Bureau of Investigation will open a national DNA database at a secret location on Tuesday. Advocates say it could significantly reduce the incidence of rape and other crimes by helping to catch repeat offenders, but some civil libertarians fear the computer database will be expanded to include almost everyone, giving the Government inordinate powers.   A1    AIDS Takes a Toll in Rural Areas  Rural America is becoming a new frontier for AIDS, as social taboos, remote locations, poverty and lack of education aggravate the experience of patients and of those trying to help them. And, as the AIDS virus becomes more common in women nationally, health experts are especially worried about rural women.   A1    An Education Brawl in Texas  In Texas, the biggest political fight this year is for control of the once-obscure State Board of Education. A coalition of Christian conservatives, who have gradually gained members on the board and transformed it into the state's most reliable producer of political theater and partisan discord, have a solid shot at becoming a majority on the 15-member board that oversees the nation's second-largest public school system.   A1    Sympathy for Beating Victim  As a gay college student lay hospitalized in critical condition after a severe beating in Laramie, that small city, which bills itself as ''Wyoming's home town,'' wrestled with its attitudes toward homosexuals.

The Cendant Corporation is dismissing most of the 2,200 representatives who once greeted new homeowners, and will replace them with direct marketing through the mail. The point is to reach more people, Cendant spokesmen say, and these days, people are not at home as much as they used to be, because of busier families and a surge in working mothers.   A15    NEW YORK/REGION   B1-8    Al Lewis, Caped Crusader, Finds a New Role in Politics  Al Lewis, who portrayed Grandpa Munster on ''The Munsters'' television series, is juggling his schedule as the Green Party's candidate for governor of New York with appearances of another sort. A few days before Election Day, Mr. Lewis, who is 88 years old, will don a vampire's cape, apply enough makeup for a suitably ghoulish cast, and help the Fairfield Garden Center promote its sale of Halloween costumes and lawn ornaments.   B1    New Rail Route to Open  A new section of track that skirts the southernmost tip of the Bronx along the Harlem River is opening to rail traffic after nearly 20 years. Built at a cost of more than $100 million per mile, the section, known as the Oak Point Link, is the linchpin to decades-old plans to expand rail freight traffic in New York City and on Long Island, get thousands of diesel fume-spewing tractor-trailers off the highways and allow freight trains to bypass commuter tracks. It is also the central component of one of the largest industrial projects seen in New York City in 30 years.   B1    City Unions Seek Pay Thaw  Unhappy about the two-year pay freeze in their contracts, New York City's municipal unions are warning that they will not accept such a freeze again, while several labor leaders are demanding an end to pattern bargaining, in which every union receives the same percentage raise.

A17    BUSINESS DAY   C1-12    Financial Crisis Hits Home  The global financial crisis and the plunging stock market are beginning to unnerve the nation's more affluent families and make them more cautious in their spending, the biggest source of economic growth in the United States. Recent economic surveys show that households with incomes above $50,000 were optimistic about their financial situation before the summer's sharp selloff in the stock market, but their optimism fell significantly in September.   A1    The decline of the stock market is bad news in New York, where securities firms employ almost 164,000 people throughout the metropolitan region. While these workers account for less than 5 percent of the labor force here, they make an enormous amount of money. That money gets spread around through the taxes they pay, and the things they buy.   A1    Microsoft Boss Looks to Future  The Federal Government and the Microsoft Corporation may be nearing a historic antitrust showdown. But William H. Gates, the man who co-founded Microsoft, has largely disengaged himself from the company's legal defense to concentrate on new ways to extend the world's largest independent software company's influence into the next century.

The building, put up by the local Donohoe Construction company, was completed in January. Mr. Bennett declined to say what it cost.\\n\\nDesigned by George Kalimaris, a local architect, the building incorporates the three-story facades of eight gutted town houses on the corner of Pennsylvania Avenue and 24th Street, three blocks from the Foggy Bottom Metro station and near several of Washington's better hotels.\\n\\nSpain will consolidate its 160-person staff in the new building early next year. It will retain its old embassy building on 16th Street, but has not yet decided on its function.\\n\\nFor more than two years, Spain had considered several options before deciding to make an unsolicited bid for the building. A spokesman for the Spanish Government said the size and design of the building were suitable for the embassy's varied functions.\\n\\nUnder the Foreign Missions Act, all foreign governments must obtain authorization from the State Department before they can legally execute a contract to buy or lease office space for official diplomatic purposes in the United States. Although not enforced by law, it is the State Department's policy to have the chanceries of all foreign governments within the District of Columbia.\\n\\nIn addition to State Department approval, foreign governments must appear before the District's zoning board. By law, the property of foreign governments is exempt from all property taxes. \\n\\nIn recent years, the District government and the State Department have encouraged embassies to locate in downtown commercial districts rather than in the residential areas along Massachusetts Avenue where most of the chanceries have traditionally been. Some have begun to leave for offices along Pennsylvania Avenue, the most notable being Canada, which in early 1989 opened a 287,000-square-foot chancery complex four blocks west of the Capitol for its 300-member delegation. \\n\\nDistrict officials are reviewing plans for a new embassy on Massachusetts Avenue for the Turkish Government.

Only this time the story lacks the freshness of that previous religious fantasy and the quality of the pathos seems considerably strained.It is the story of a 6-year-old orphan who lives in painful poverty with his brusque but affectionate uncle, a bullfighter gone to seed. The two of them scrounge around the city (apparently Madrid), trying to scrape up enough pesetas so the uncle can rent a bullfighter's suit and take another engagement in the bull ring in a comedy routine.After several hapless ventures at assorted shady jobs, all of them edged with pathos (the script writers pour it on), the uncle gets his go in the bull ring and is made a howling buffoon, even though he wants to shine for his nephew. That's the note on which it ends.Pablito Calvo is the youngster, a bit larger and more self-conscious than he was in the idyllic \\"Marcelino,\\" but still a very appealing lad. And Antonio Vico, who was one of the holy brothers in \\"Marcelino,\\" is the uncle here. They both act with obvious calculation, intent on making those little poignancies good for as many gulps and sniffles as the audiences' sentiment will bear. But the sum effect is a sense of trickery. It is almost as dubious as their act, when they try to cheat people with cheap watches on the plea that they need money for a hospital bill.Paolo Stoppa, Walter Chiari and Carlo Campanini are most conspicuous among the players of small roles, none of which is distinctive.

Review and article dates are in parentheses. Prices are current. Here are some Manhattan restaurants that specialize in American cuisine.    Gotham Bar and Grill     12 East 12th Street, in Manhattan, (212) 620-4020 -- If stars were awarded for the food's altitude on the plate, Gotham Bar and Grill would have no serious rivals. Alfred Portale, the I. M. Pei of contemporary American cooking, brings new meaning to the term haute cuisine with his skyscraper salads, towers of twirled pasta, high-rises of french fries and soaring desserts.   A lesser talent might use such diversions to disguise substantive shortcomings, but for Mr. Portale, one of the most accomplished young chefs on the American scene, this is just his whimsical signature. Among appetizers on the current menu are celeriac-apple ravioli with braised duck, savoy cabbage and green lentils","excerpt":"Spanish mackerel with new potatoes; chickory salad with Roquefort croutons and Caesar dressing, and a seafood salad of squid, scallops, Japanese octopus and lobster tossed in lemon and olive oil.   For main courses there are roasted red snapper with potatoes, onion, garlic and rosemary; shellfish bouillabaisse with garlic, fennel, tomato and potato; grilled Muscovy duck breast, with whole roasted shallots, sour cherries and pinot noir sauce, and grilled rack of lamb served with flageolets, mustard and roasted garlic.    Appetizers range from $8.75 to $14, main courses $25.50 to $30. Sunday hours 5:30 to 9:30 P.M. (Review, Sept. 29, 1989.) The River Cafe     1 Water Street, Brooklyn, (718) 522-5200 -- The River Cafe, on a barge on the Brooklyn shore of the East River under the Brooklyn Bridge, remains one of the most spellbinding settings in New York. The vista of lower Manhattan across the busy waterway is stirring at any time but especially at dusk, when the sky deepens to silvery indigo and the lights begin flickering in the glass towers of Manhattan.   The dining room, with a piano bar on one side and rows of well-spaced tables, all with good views, attracts a blend of special-occasion revelers, out-of-town visitors and well-heeled New Yorkers. Since early 1988, the chef has been David Burke, an inventive former sous-chef at the cafe. Mr. Burke, 28 years old, obviously has fun with food presentation, and many of his winsome creations leave diners reluctant to disassemble them.   Some starters are sauteed sea scallops with fennel seeds, pink pepper and curry oil; parfait of tuna and salmon tartar with osetra and salmon caviar; barbecued squab with foie gras corn cakes, pistachio and onion marmalade; and sauteed quail with sweetbreads, home fries and bacon.    Among the main courses are seared salmon with ginger and cracked pepper served with burgundy butter and lotus chips; lobster in honey crumbs with Japanese scented lobster sauce and scallion cake; roast rack of lamb with a chestnut meal crust and served with a sweet potato shepherd's pie, and venison steak with sauteed foie gras, roasted turnips, and confit of dates.    The dinner menu is a $55 prix fixe. Sunday service is from 6 to 11:30 P.M. (Review, May 6, 1988.) Arizona 206     206 East 60th Street, in Manhattan, (212) 838-0440 -- Any cook with a bag of jalapenos can ladle out the fiery dishes; it takes finesse to create an exciting and harmonious balance. No place does it better than Arizona 206, the Southwestern style restaurant in the shadow of Bloomingdale's. The dining room's Southwestern setting is achieved with undulating molded plaster walls, bare wooden floors and tables, and clusters of desert flowers and braided peppers.   Among starters are corn bisque with shrimp and crispy ancho chilies; creole pecan and arugula salad with pear nectar vinaigrette and blue goat cheese; black-bean cakes with dandelion greens and cajun crawfish, and sauteed sweet water prawns with herbed aioli. Main courses include red chili chicken and poblano dumpling stew; warm lobster tostada salad with chili and avocado sauce; grilled squab with Serrano-apricot glaze and hot curry linguine; seared loin of venison with white bean, broccoli rape, succotash and pistachio pesto, and roast eggplant terrine with grilled vegetable and smoked tomato salsa.   Appetizers range from $6 to $14; entrees $18 to $29. Sunday dinner hours are 6 to 10:30 P.M. (Review, March 24, 1989.) The Water Club     East River at 30th Street, in Manhattan, (212) 683-3333 -- The Water Club is an exuberant spot that offers sweeping views as well as sophisticated American cuisine by its chef, Richard Moonen. You enter the Water Club via a nautical-looking bar with a long shellfish display on one side. In warm weather, the top deck is an al fresco cocktail area. The two-tier main dining room, wrapped in glass, has views of the river and at night when the lights are low, the effect can be romantic.    Appetizers on the current menu include seafood gumbo; New England chowder with rock crab meat and steamed clams; grilled jumbo shrimp on sesame noodles, and warm Long Island duckling salad. For main courses there are grilled swordfish over sweet pepper ragout; basil-crusted salmon steak on spinach with a citrus sauce and crispy potatoes; braised grouper in chardonnay-lobster stock with wild mushrooms and artichokes, and grilled chicken served with an apple cornbread stuffing and cranberry relish.    Appetizers range from $8 to $16; entrees $18 to $28. Sunday dinner service is from 5:45 to 10:30 P.M. (Review, Oct. 21, 1988.)   The Times Restaurant Line offers capsule reviews by cuisine, price and location (in New York City and suburbs), published in the last 18 months.
