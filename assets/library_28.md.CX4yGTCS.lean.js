It was the third act of this year's Inner Circle show, the annual roast of local politicians by the City Hall press corps, and the reporter playing Governor Carey was singing the Governor's political goodbye.   The song itself was uncommon for these satirical rites, because instead of the usual barbed caricature of a public official, the lyrics (to the tune of ''My Way'') were a reasonably kind and reasonably honest depiction of the Carey career in Albany. The singer reached the fourth stanza - about the death penalty: Be true unto yourself No matter what the opposition. The state should not snuff out a life No matter what - that's my position. There was suddenly a smattering of applause. It built into a modest wave, through all parts of the New York Hilton ballroom. Only 10 seconds or so, but it seemed a long time. People looked at each other and smiled. They were surprised. Something nice had happened. Yes, some of the applause was surely of the sentimental variety, for a man who was leaving office, but there was more to it than that.

Roberts Jr., evaluating his fitness to lead the Supreme Court. Here are a few ways they probed and prodded:    Head and Heart         And I guess what has begun to concern me a little bit is Judge Roberts, the legal automaton, as opposed to Judge Roberts, the man, because I've heard so many times, ''I can't really say because it may come before me.''    Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California         Great justices are more than just legal automatons, legal technicians. They are more than just that. And though they lose their individuality when they put on a black robes, great justices never forget who they are.    Senator Arlen Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania         When you put on that black robe and assume your spot on the Supreme Court, you will surely bring with you your heart and your soul.    Senator Mike DeWine, Republican of Ohio         It's important to determine not just the quality of your mind but the fullness of your heart.    Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York         Well, there are all kind of hearts. There are bleeding hearts and there are hard hearts.    Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina    Now Batting         Judges are like umpires. Umpires don't make the rules","excerpt":"they apply them. The role of an umpire and a judge is critical. They make sure everybody plays by the rules. But it is a limited role. Nobody ever went to a ball game to see the umpire.    Judge Roberts         The umpire should call the ball fair or foul -- it's in or it's out -- but not get actively involved as a player on the field. And, unfortunately, we've gotten to a point today where in many respects the judiciary is the most active policy player on the field.    Senator Sam Brownback, Republican of Kansas         As you know, in Major League Baseball, they have a rule. Rule two defines the strike zone. It basically says from the shoulders to the knees. And the only question about judges is: Do they have good eyesight or not? They don't get to change the strike zone. They don't get to say, That was down around the ankles and I think it was a strike. They don't get to do that.    Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., Democrat of Delaware         Would a neutral umpire have overturned a 58-year-old Supreme Court precedent and gone against the understanding of the authors of the 14th Amendment and also the views of almost half of the state legislatures at that time in making the decision that they made?    Senator Herb Kohl, Democrat of Wisconsin    But Enough About You         Let me go on to my next question: violence against women. I realize it's a bit of a hobby horse for me, since I wrote the legislation. And I know people say they wrote things. I mean, I actually did write that my little old self, with my staff. And no one liked it, I might add, at first; women's groups or anybody else.    Senator Biden         When I was a federal prosecutor, I prosecuted a lot of those cases. As a young prosecutor, I was sort of an expert at it in the 70's, and I proved sometimes the interstate commerce by simply putting an agent on there saying there was no gun manufacturer in Alabama. Or it said ''Made in Italy'' on it. I remember I got that affirmed one time as proof beyond a reasonable doubt that it was not made in Alabama. So Lopez, I believe, is a good decision.    Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama         All the members of this body know a young man with Down syndrome named Jimmy. Maybe you've met him, even. He runs the elevator that takes the senators up and down on the Senate floors. His warm smile welcomes us every day. We're a better body for him.      He told me the other day -- he frequently gives me a hug in the elevator afterwards. I know he does Senator Hatch often, too, who kindly gives him ties, some of which I question the taste of.    Senator Brownback    Truly, Madly, Metaphorically         I think all of us retain, from the days of our youth, certain enduring images. For me those images are of the endless fields of Indiana, stretching to the horizon, punctuated only by an isolated silo or a barn. And as I grew older, those endless fields came to represent for me the limitless possibilities of our great land. Now that I am here, I recall those endless fields with their promise of infinite possibilities, and that memory inspires in me a very profound commitment.    Judge Roberts         It's as if I asked you: What kind of movies do you like? Tell me two or three good movies. And you say, I like movies with good acting. I like movies with good directing. I like movies with good cinematography. And I ask you, No, give me an example of a good movie. You don't name one. I say, Give me an example of a bad movie. You won't name one. Then I ask you if you like ''Casablanca,'' and you respond by saying, Lots of people like ''Casablanca.'' You tell me it's widely settled that ''Casablanca'' is one of the great movies.    Senator Schumer    Say What?         Would you agree that the opposite of being dead is being alive?    Senator Tom Coburn, Republican of Oklahoma    Does the Constitution permit the execution of an innocent person?    Senator Patrick Leahy, Democrat of Vermont         And sometimes the principles, everyone agrees, are part of the Constitution or as the late chief justice --your mentor -- said, ''tacit postulates.'' He used that, as you know, in a case just before you got there, in Nevada v. Hall. He used the phrase tacit postulates. He said that these tacit postulates are as much ingrained in the fabric of the document as its express provisions. And he went on to conclude that -- this case was about -- the case is not particularly relevant, but the point is, I think -- Chief Justice Rehnquist made this vital point and it was about state's right and language that didn't speak directly to them in the Constitution.     And he concluded that the answer was a rule he was able to infer from the overall constitutional plan.     So, Judge, you're going to be an inferrer, not an umpire.    Senator Biden    To Speak, Perchance to Sleep         It's seeming like a long birthday.    Senator Brownback, thanking Senator Specter for recognizing his 49th birthday         As the 15th speaker in the order of seniority here, I recall the adage I learned when I first came to Washington that everything's been said, but not everyone has said it yet.    Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas         Now, you've seen that each one of us have a couple of soapboxes that we like to mount. And after about five minutes of our opinion, then we ask you a question.    Senator Jon Kyl, Republican of Arizona Judge Roberts, Meet Our Expansive Senators"},{"year":"2005","title":"THE UMP  John G. Roberts Jr.  It's already one of Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr.'s most-quoted lines: ''Judges are like umpires -- umpires don't make the rules","excerpt":"they apply them.'' Chief Justice Roberts began his umpiring duties for the Supreme Court on Monday, and by Wednesday he was facing his first thorny case, concerning doctor-assisted suicide in Oregon. The question before the Roberts court is whether John Ashcroft overstepped his authority as United States attorney general when in 2001 he decided to punish Oregon doctors following the state law that allows such assistance.    BATTER UP  Harriet E. Miers  It was a long week for Harriet E. Miers. Selected by the president to fill the Supreme Court seat of the departing Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, Ms. Miers found herself under fire and scrutiny from the left, right and center. She and her supporters spent much of the time trying to assuage the critics, one of whom was Senator Sam Brownback, Republican of Kansas and a skeptic on Ms. Miers's anti-abortion credentials. Mr. Brownback called Chief Justice Roberts ''a rock star of a lawyer'' and noted of Ms. Miers, ''You're really following Elvis here.''    BENCHED  Tom DeLay  Tom who? Representative Tom DeLay's ethics woes deepened last week with a second indictment. This one, also handed up by a Texas grand jury, accused him of money laundering in a $190,000 transaction that prosecutors call a violation of the ban on the use of corporate money in local campaigns. Mr. DeLay stepped down temporarily as majority leader after the first indictment, the week before, on conspiracy charges involving the same transaction. In their first test without him, House Republicans showed signs of strain on Friday, barely passing an energy bill.    CAUGHT STEALING?  Leandro Aragoncillo  An F.B.I. analyst arrested last month on charges that he passed secrets to the Philippines is the subject of a new question: Did he gain improper access to White House secrets when he was a marine working in the office of the vice president, first under Al Gore and then under Dick Cheney? The analyst, Leandro Aragoncillo, has worked for the F.B.I. in New Jersey for a little more than a year.    THE PITCH  George W. Bush  The war against incompetence having made some headway in the Gulf Coast, it was back to the war against terror. In a speech on Thursday, President Bush said that the United States and its allies had disrupted a handful of serious plots since the Sept. 11 attacks. He referred to the enemy as ''Islamo-fascism'' and said, ''Against such an enemy, there's only one effective response: we never back down, never give in and never accept anything less than complete victory.''

The packaging mentioned that this was ''the legendary notebook of Hemingway, Picasso, Chatwin.'' Frasco's basic reaction to that was, Yeah, right. But he liked the notebook's construction and purchased one. Later he went online and did a search for ''Moleskine'' and ''My Moleskine.'' ''And man,'' he says, ''I saw a lot.'' Modo & Modo, the Italian company that has been producing the notebooks since 1998, sells more than four million a year in about 40 countries. Clearly something not only makes people want to have these notebooks but also makes them want other people to know that they have them. ''We know now that it's sort of a symbol,'' says Samantha Rossini, Modo & Modo's project manager.     The back story (laid out in a multilingual pamphlet that comes with each notebook) goes like this: The original Moleskine notebooks were made by ''small French bookbinders'' and sold in stationery stores in Paris. One devoted buyer was the British writer Bruce Chatwin, who bought them by the score until production stopped in 1986. Rossini says that Chatwin made a point to write his name, address and a reward offer in his Moleskines, should he lose one. Probably he was more interested in saving the words he had written than the object he'd written them on, but never mind. The point is that Modo & Modo decided to revive the notebooks, with a strategy of linking them to the creative people who have used them -- not unlike that old Gap campaign featuring James Dean and Jack Kerouac and other icons who wore khakis. The difference is that the journal signifies not merely style but also creativity. Consumers are encouraged to mail in quotes about writing, for example, for use in a series of postcards and stickers distributed with the notebooks.

(Upon learning that Zane's novels were being issued in Japan, The Guardian of London took pity on the translator who had to render faithfully lines like: ''No matter how hoochie I tried to be, she out-hoochied me every single time.'') Zane is the pseudonym of a suburban mother of three -- she refuses to divulge her real name -- who is in her late 30's and lives outside Washington. She began writing erotic stories in the late 1990's when, as a single mother, she was looking for something to do after her children went to bed. The stories became popular after she posted them on the Web, and she later self-published her first book, ''The Sex Chronicles,'' which sold more than 100,000 copies. Zane is well on her way to establishing herself as a habanero-hot global brand. She has founded her own publishing house, owns a bookstore, has film deals in the works and hopes to start a line of lingerie. If the titles of two of her forthcoming books -- There's a Pitbull in My Bed'' and ''Dear G Spot'' -- are any indication, Zane is looking to out-hoochie almost every writer alive.    MEET THE PELZERS: Dave Pelzer's four memoirs -- the best known is ''A Child Called 'It' '' -- are among the most successful volumes in the recent history of the Times nonfiction paperback list, where they have spent a combined total of some 618 weeks. Pelzer's books are hard to read, not only because he examines (and re-examines) the abuse he suffered at the hands of his alcoholic mother, but because they are Lloyd Webberian in their operatic weepiness. Pelzer has sometimes been accused of stretching the facts in his books. But now one of his brothers, Richard B. Pelzer, has arrived with a memoir that backs up his claims and adds a new twist to the Pelzer narrative: Richard writes that after Dave left home, he became the new-and-abused ''It'' boy in his household. Richard's book, ''A Brother's Journey,'' is No. 23 on the extended hardcover nonfiction list this week, after making its debut last week at No. 12. In ''A Brother's Journey,'' Richard is forced to drink Tabasco and is beaten so frequently that he learns to sleep with his eyes open. Some readers will find this book exceedingly honest and brave; others will think it so syrupy that they'll need a shot of Tabasco themselves, if only to cleanse their palates.

The young Cornell believes in U.F.O.'s to the same extent that he believes in his father. His mother disappeared when he was 4 years old; according to his father, she was abducted in a spaceship by aliens.   Having set up this oddly dysfunctional family and its slightly anomalous near-future world, Mr. Reed tosses the first of his bombshells. One otherwise ordinary summer evening the sky changes permanently: the stars disappear, to be replaced by an \\"everted\\" image of the surface of the earth as it might appear reflected on the inside of a vast mirrored ball. Fifty miles up, this illusion ends; the universe has not changed, only our earthbound view of it. The Change, as people come to call it, triggers a change in Cornell's relationship with his father. Instead of being hailed as a prophet in his own time, Nathan Novak is revealed as a pathetic old man whose lifelong obsession with aliens provides no insight into the new reality.

But the trial also raised some troubling issues that the verdict alone did not resolve. Foremost among them: What exactly is it that makes a photograph art?   In finding the Contemporary Arts Center and its director, Dennis Barrie, not guilty of obscenity, the eight-member jury decided that Mapplethorpe's pictures, while appealing to the prurient interest and patently offensive, nevertheless do not lack artistic merit. To be found pornographic under current Supreme Court guidelines, all three criteria have to be met.   According to reports of remarks made by several jurors afterward, the prosecution's mistake was in not rebutting the defense's expert witnesses. These witnesses - art critics, museum directors and curators - asserted with unshakable passion that the 7 pictures at issue (out of the 175 in the show) were works of art.   The explanations of why they might be works of art, however, varied from expert to expert and ranged from the tautological to the disingenuous. Robert Sobieszek, recently named curator of photographs at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and a longtime curator at the International Museum of Photography at George Eastman House in Rochester, was asked how he recognized a photograph as a work of art. He replied, \\"If it's in an art museum, it is intended to be art, and that's why it's there.\\"   Janet Kardon, who organized the offending retrospective exhibition, \\"Robert Mapplethorpe: The Perfect Moment,\\" for the Institute of Contemporary Art in Philadelphia, called Mapplethorpe \\"one of the most important photographers working in the 1980's in the formalist mode.\\"   When asked to comment on one of the photographs, one that shows a finger inserted in a penis, Ms. Kardon, who is a former director of the Institute of Contemporary Art, said, \\"It's a central image, very symmetrical, a very ordered, classical composition.\\" Asked about a picture of a forearm inserted into a man's anus, she compared its composition to one of Mapplethorpe's images of flowers.   According to the news reports, the jury based its findings largely on such expert testimony. One juror, a warehouse manager named James Jones, perhaps best summarized the panel's feelings when he said: \\"I'm not an expert. I don't understand Picasso's art. But I assume the people who call it art know what they're talking about.\\"   In the case of photography, unfortunately, Mr. Jones's faith may not be fully justified. The assertion that Mapplethorpe was an artist \\"in the formalist mode,\\" and the analysis of his photographs in terms of symmetry and classical composition, beg the question of what makes his pictures - or any photographs - art.   True, his pictures are models of conventional photographic technique","excerpt":"they are as sharp, beautifully modulated and impeccably printed as anything Paul Strand or Edward Weston produced. But their surfaces are only part of the story; they are Desdemona to the Iago of Mapplethorpe's subject matter.   Jacquelynn Baas, director of the University Art Museum in Berkeley, Calif., came closest to the truth when she told the prosecutor, Frank Prouty Jr., \\"It's the tension between the physical beauty of the photograph and the brutal nature of what's going on in it that gives it the particular quality that this work of art has.\\"   Any really believable explanation of what makes Mapplethorpe's photographs art would have to take into account not only the tension between form and content noted by Ms. Baas, but also the peculiarities of photography as an art form.   For example, the history of photography as an art is filled with examples of pictures that convert traditionally ugly or tasteless subject matter into images of beauty. Graffiti and gutter trash have been turned into painterly abstractions; the sick, mad and dispossessed have been shown in poses that mimic Renaissance compositions. And almost from the moment of the medium's birth in 1839, photographers have been fascinated with the contradictory but inherent eroticism of the camera's disembodied gaze.   One might go so far as to say that the limits of propriety have always been one of photography's essential subjects, and that this tradition is essential to the medium's existence as a form of art. In its interactions with the traditions of painting, photography has long functioned as a reminder of the actual world, as a sign that art, no matter how incorporeal, is rooted in the flesh.   In Mapplethorpe's case, the contested, fleshy subject matter of the pictures featured in the Cincinnati trial coexists with such \\"innocent\\" contents as the faces of celebrities and calla lilies. By placing them all in a single continuum, Mapplethorpe's work suggests that society's traditional moral values are less important than the Platonic ideal of beauty. This is the essential key to his art, whether one agrees with it or not. (Cincinnati officials, obviously, did not.) Still, one cannot judge Mapplethorpe's work as art without seeing his elegant prints, and undoubtedly the most curious aspect of the trial was that the jury never did. Instead, they were shown 8-by-10-inch glossies - press prints, in common parlance - and videotapes of the exhibition as it hung at the Contemporary Arts Center last spring. That they could intuit this secondhand evidence as art was as much of a surprise as the verdict itself.   Inside the courtroom, the apparent vindication of contemporary art seemed less clear-cut than the verdict would indicate. Watching the jury selection, as this writer did for two days, one could not help noticing that most potential jurors were of two minds. Asked by the prosecution if society had a right to proscribe certain sexual images from the public eye, they answered yes. Asked five minutes later by the defense if adults should be able to look at whatever they wanted to, so long as they did so of their own free will, they also answered yes.   In this apparent contradiction lies something essential to the American character, which in the end was as much the subject of the trial as Mapplethorpe's photographs. Americans, by and large, still bear the traces of their colonial heritage: they are at once predisposed to Puritanism and deeply resentful of governmental interference in their daily lives. Asked to decide between the two, they often opt for a libertarian position.   The finding of artistic merit in the Mapplethorpe case, coming in the wake of repeated attacks on the National Endowment for the Arts for promoting artwork that some find pornographic, blasphemous or unabashedly political, may have eased somewhat the art world's growing sense of alienation from society at large. Here, after all, was a jury of four men and four women who rarely if ever had entered a museum, whose cultural life consisted largely of watching television and reading magazines, and who by all appearances represented a cross section of middle America. Yet they took only two hours to agree that the prosecution had not proved its case.   It could have been quite different, a possibility that the defense lawyers, H. Louis Sirkin and Marc D. Mezibov, acknowledged when they spoke about how they chose their expert witnesses. Mr. Sirkin is reported to have sought out those with Midwest connections and manners, adding, \\"My big concern is that they don't equate us with the 'wacky' art world.\\"   If the prosecution had been able to frame the case in terms of us versus them - common-sense middle America against a \\"wacky\\" art world - it might have struck a nerve. For contemporary art, especially that which positions itself in the vanguard of cultural life, is always on the edge of social acceptability and thus always vulnerable.   Contemporary art is also linked in the public mind to a moneyed, urban elite that has little in common with the cultural life of the Cincinnati jurors. The prosecution might have done well to enlist the thoughts of Martha Rosler, a New York artist and critic, who has written that most art is \\"patently exclusionary in its appeal, culturally relative in its concerns, and indissolubly wedded to big money and 'upper class' life in general.\\"   The reaction of the art world to the trial did little to dispel this bias. Cincinnati came to be seen as a place filled exclusively with religious fanatics, bigots and philistines. As prospective jurors were being questioned in the courtroom, sympathizers of the Contemporary Arts Center could be heard to groan over their answers. Ordinary men and women who had never had occasion to visit an art museum were assumed to be proponents of censorship, or worse. Of course the verdict turned these preconceptions on their heads.   Smug feelings of superiority are exactly what contemporary art does not need if it is to widen its audience and gain more sympathy. Instead of standing on the barricades defending itself with the First Amendment, it should be trying to bring its messages to the very kinds of people that served on the Cincinnati jury. In this sense, the Mapplethorpe trial may have lessons for everyone.

Cocteau, and it is \\"a probing study of the private world of a brother and sister who share one room, with its secrets, treasures, memories and cluttered appurtenances that betray the total lack of emotional discipline and the disorderly lives of those who occupy it.\\"So long as the program says so, we imagine that's what it's about. We could make out a young man and a young woman, played by Edouard Dermithe and Nicolo Stephane, who are brother and sister in the fable and who certainly reside in a \\"cluttered\\" and \\"disorderly\\" room. We could also see very plainly—again as the program says—that \\"they are not the ordinary brother and sister","excerpt":"they are bizarre, eccentric, lovable, wicked and strange people—untouched and isolated by circumstances from the world.\\"But more than this we can't tell you—except that they steal watering cans, eat crabs in bed, walk through echoing chambers and eternally yap at each other like peevish dogs. They also have a couple of moody playmates in Ranee Cosima and Jacques Bernard, who appear to be utterly bewildered by the tortured eccentricities of their friends.Nor does M. Cocteau help matters any by breaking in on the sound track now and then to mutter mysterious phrases in poetic cadences—such things as \\"no sooner had Paul entered this deserted studio than he took possession of it like a cautious cat\\" and \\"all they could discover were shadows, phantoms of feeling.\\" Rot!In this corner's estimation, \\"The Strange Ones\\" is pretentious poppycock and the actors who have to swish through it look downright ridiculous in their roles.

How much longer can this bull market last, they wonder, and what happens if stocks decline?   Value investing, or buying stocks that are relatively cheap, may offer some comfort for the skittish. These shares tend to rise when the economy is expanding -- as is projected next year -- and to hold up relatively well when stock prices fall.   \\"There are no great expectations with value stocks,\\" said Lewis J. Altfest, a New York financial planner. \\"Low price-earnings stocks tend to have lower declines in an extended market decline.\\"   Value stocks are broadly defined as issues selling below book value with above-average dividends and the potential for much higher valuations in the near future. \\"A value player is really going against conventional opinion,\\" said David Dreman, chairman of Dreman Value Management.   In contrast, growth stocks have high price-earnings ratios and low dividend yields","excerpt":"they are bought by investors for the long term. \\"Growth managers tend to buy things that are perceived as being cheap some years ahead,\\" said Robert Moseson, president of Performance Analytics, a Chicago pension consulting firm.   Buying value stocks does not necessarily mean sacrificing returns. Value stocks, especially the cyclical issues, have largely outperformed growth stocks for the last two years.   Among the Standard & Poor's 500, value stocks rose 16.61 percent in the first 11 months of this year and 10.59 percent in 1992, according to the S.& P./Barra value index. The comparable index of growth stocks is up only 0.97 percent this year, and rose 5.14 percent last year.   The smaller stocks in the Russell 1000 followed a similar course. Its value index advanced 18.4 percent in the first three quarters of 1993 and 13.8 percent in 1992, while its growth index fell 0.9 percent in the first three quarters and advanced just 5 percent last year.   Many stock experts believe this pattern will continue in 1994 as the economy picks up steam. \\"Some people are saying that growth stocks are due for a liftoff, but I think it is premature,\\" David Shulman, chief equity strategist for Salomon Brothers, said. \\"I think value stocks will continue to outperform in 1994.\\"   That is because companies that sell at low price-earnings ratios are generally sensitive to overall economic conditions. Roger Hertog, president of Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, said, \\"If you look at the last period of time when the economy went through robust growth, 1983 to 1986, value stocks did extraordinarily well for a significant portion.\\"    A prime candidate for some value stocks would be an investor who loaded up on small-company growth stocks over the last few years. Although value stocks have generally been ahead of the pack, this subset of growth stocks has an exceptional three-year record. The Wilshire small-company growth index rose 12.5 percent in the first 11 months this year, 13.2 percent in 1992 and 56.8 percent in 1991.   By chasing those high returns, many investors have assumed significant risk, for their stocks would probably be hit hard by a market reversal. Some diversification now could lessen any blow.   Among the well-known names in the value category are American Express, Baxter, Cigna, Exxon, General Motors and Helene Curtis. Peers on the growth side include Coca-Cola, Home Depot, Kellogg, Microsoft, Pfizer and Wal-Mart.   Stocks often move from one category to the other over time. I.B.M., for example, reported superior earnings for decades and was considered a leading growth stock. Then its price plummeted, making it a value stock.   Banking issues were perceived as value stocks in 1989 when Wall Street professionals were generally uninterested in their lackluster performance. Two years later, lower interest rates ignited a prolonged rally in bank shares, which soon after were classified as growth stocks.   History indicates that neither growth nor value stocks will remain on top too long before being supplanted by the other. In the three years before 1992, growth stocks surpassed value stocks.   For that reason, some money managers are beginning to shift toward growth. Value stocks may already have peaked, these managers suggest, and growth stocks will soon reign supreme.   \\"I'm looking for companies with high earnings growth,\\" said John H. Laporte, president of the T. Rowe Price New Horizons Fund. \\"If I can find companies that are growing at 20 percent, I know I'm going to do well.\\"   Cautious investors will want to make sure they have both growth and value issues in their portfolios. Some advisers even suggest going for the best of both worlds.   John L. Manley Jr., a managing director of Smith Barney Shearson, suggested, \\"Try to find a stock with some natural growth that is cheaper than it once was.\\" In a Slumping Market, Value Stocks Can Shine"},{"year":"1929","title":"Fourteen steamships will sail today for foreign ports with 3,000 passengers going to the South of France, Italy, Egypt, South Africa, Central and South America and the West Indies.   14 SHIPS SAIL TODAY FOR FOREIGN PORTS","excerpt":"They Are Bound for All Parts of the World--Passenger Lists Total 3,000.

The Hearst Corporation will produce and distribute the series, to begin in January in Boston. The periodic installments are expected to run for two years. Although Heinz is to be the only national advertiser, air time will be open to local advertisers.   The series would include star-studded dramas, documentaries and other features, dealing with the \\"stresses and challenges\\" of American family life in the 90's.    \\"When people buy a product, their choice goes beyond the performance of that product","excerpt":"they are buying a company,\\" said Brian Ruder, the vice president of consumer products for Heinz U.S.A., a subsidiary of the Pittsburgh-based H.

(Ecco, $19.95.) As was the case with his 1949 novel, ''The Sheltering Sky,'' this collection of shorter fiction explores the Muslim experience and sensibility, and the Western fascination with an exotic Islamic culture. Written between 1946 and 1993 (when Bowles lived as an expatriate in Tangier), these stripped-down and ruthlessly unsentimental tales provide a ''map . . . of the author's development: the long contours and big shapes of the Bowles career are visible as we work through the pages and the decades,'' John Sutherland said here in 2001.    A SMUGGLER'S BIBLE, by Joseph McElroy. (Overlook, $15.95.) While traveling aboard a trans-Atlantic liner to London, David Brooke, the tormented hero of McElroy's first novel, tries to connect eight jumbled manuscripts into a single narrative recounting the lives and sufferings of his family and friends. The book's chapters alternate between the manuscripts, or ''memories,'' and an account of Brooke's emotionally unnerving shipboard experiences. Our reviewer, James R. Frakes, called this a ''remarkable novel'' and admired the author's ''daring, range and brilliant subtlety.''    CICERO: The Life and Times of Rome's Greatest Politician, by Anthony Everitt. (Random House, $14.95.) The author traces the ascent of Marcus Tullius Cicero to the Senate, where he reigned as Rome's premier courtroom orator and a tactful persuader, and his later disappointment, exile and worse -- his execution -- as the republic slid toward autocracy. Last year in these pages, T. Corey Brennan said Everitt ''writes fluidly and has taken the trouble to look at many ancient sources relevant to his study, especially Cicero's own works.''    A PELICAN IN THE WILDERNESS: Hermits, Solitaries and Recluses, by Isabel Colegate. (Counterpoint, $15.95.) A British novelist's first nonfiction work is a series of meditations on extreme solitude and those hermits throughout history who have been driven from the flock by their disgust at the lack of spirituality in whatever culture they belong to. The cast runs from the Buddha to J. D. Salinger, and includes a fifth-century saint who lived for 36 years in a hut on top of a 60-foot pillar. Colegate's ''pace is civilized and leisurely, but she covers much ground and has clearly done a good deal of research and travel, some of it arduous,'' Frank Kermode said in the Book Review last year.    THINGS THAT FALL FROM THE SKY, by Kevin Brockmeier. (Vintage Contemporaries, $12.95.) Among the things that fall from above in this first collection of short fiction (much of it preoccupied with loss) are a deadly bucket that crashes through a schoolroom window, rain, turning leaves and a gigantic black spot that eclipses the sun and threatens to destroy an entire town. The result is a ''delightful, sad and often magical book,'' Hillary Frey wrote here in 2002. ''Brockmeier's small, carefully made worlds are like Steven Millhauser's","excerpt":"they are definitely fantastic and, miraculously, utterly human.''    SOMEBODY'S GOTTA TELL IT: The Upbeat Memoir of a Working-Class Journalist, by Jack Newfield. (St. Martin's, $15.95.) The feisty Brooklyn-born muckraker tells of his experiences in the tumultuous 60's, and of the era's wild characters from the worlds of politics, sports, crime and journalism. It's all brought ''fleetingly and vividly to life,'' Richard Lourie said here in 2002. ''Future historians will be glad to come across this book, which echoes the music of the times, a crazy jazz syncopated by gunshots.''    DEMON OF THE WATERS: The True Story of the Mutiny on the Whaleship Globe, by Gregory Gibson. (Back Bay/Little, Brown, $14.95.) The grisly 1824 mutiny aboard the Globe, a New England whaler, was the bloodiest in the history of American whaling, featuring ax murders, beatings, nasty encounters with Pacific islanders and the eventual murder of the chief mutineer, a Manson-like figure who dreamed of ruling his own tropical kingdom. Last year in the Book Review, Sara Wheeler, reviewing this account and Mutiny on the Globe: The Fatal Voyage of Samuel Comstock, by Thomas Farel Heffernan (Penguin, $14), found them both to be ''lively'' re-creations of the uprising and its aftermath (six crewmen managed to escape). The authors ''are scrupulous,'' she added, ''and both have produced a welcome addition to the canon of whaling literature.''

The human rights situation in Kenya that prompted some countries to restrict aid has not changed enough to warrant restoration.   Kenya remains a one-party state by law, where lawyers, members of the church and others who have espoused views different from those of the Government are harassed by the authorities.

The works happened to be on opposite ends of the operatic spectrum, calling for radically different vocal and dramatic styles: Strauss's \\"Elektra\\" in a 1975 Gotz Friedrich production, and Smetana's \\"Bartered Bride\\" in an English National Opera production new to Chicago this season.

A large number of spectators, many of them invited for the occasion, gave it hearty approval.It is as a work in kinetic photography the screened \\"Four Horsemen\\" should first be considered, because its standing as a photoplay depends upon its pictorial properties and not upon its relation to a widely read novel. The most important fact about the production, then, is that, although it has a good deal of the wordiness, erratic tempo and illogical emphasis common to screen adaptations of printed stories, it is nevertheless distinguished from many other works of its kind by genuine cinematographic qualities. It is made, if not entirely, at least in large part, of telling moving pictures. Many of its scenes are the result of fine photography, and, better still, fine cinematography. Rex Ingram, the director of the production, is among those who believe that principles of painting and sculpture should be applied to motion pictures, and scenes in \\"The Four Horsemen\\" are concrete illustrations of what the application of these principles means. Evidently Mr. Ingram's expressed ideas are not merely subjects of idle conversation with him. He tries to do what he says ought to be done. His pictures, for example, are smooth and soft, and yet as distinct as the sharpest photography could make them","excerpt":"they are effectively lighted; and their dramatic, as well as purely pictorial, value has been moving and still objects. Mr. Ingram must have devoted much time and thought to composition, and in a number of instances he has achieved something different and better than materials at the disposal of other directors and frequently used by them in the last few years. For example, there is a scene of troops marching through a French village, which is scarcely a new subject at this post-war date, yet Mr. Ingram has presented it with new effectiveness by breaking the main line of march of the troops and occasionally diverting from it companies and squads of men. Thus he has given fluidity and unity to his whole scene instead of dividing it into two still pictures as a continuous column of men moving in a straight line or simple curve would do—and often has done in other photoplays.Mr. Ingram has made many eloquent motion pictures. This means that, although the spectator now and then has the impression that the photoplay is simply the novel splendidly illustrated, this impression is dissipated as often as it is formed by scenes and successions of scenes which speak for themselves, tell their part of the narrative in their own language without the aid of words. The execution of the citizens of Villeblanche, for example, is done in pure cinematography, and is one of the most impressive incidents of the story. In bringing the symbolic Four Horsemen into the photoplay Mr. Ingram again has done his work cinematographically, and with such a discerning sense of the unreal in reality that what might easily have been banal or incongruous has become a pervading and leavening part of the picture.The photoplay has been cast with a clear eye for types and acting ability. The characters used primarily to give color to the picture—South American natives. Spanish, French and German specimens—are all strikingly individualized, and those who have the more extensive roles not only look their parts but act them intelligibly, especially Rudolph Valentine as the young Julio, Joseph Swickard as old Don Marcelo, Alice Terry as Marguerite, Alan Hale as Karl von Hartrott, and Nigel De Brulier as Tchernoff, the Russian mystic.Many will want to know, of course, how closely the photoplay resembles the book, and they may be assured that it is, on the whole, a faithful and appreciative translation of what Blasco Ibañez wrote. There have been changes, some necessary or wise, others capricious, but June Mathis, who made the scenario, has followed the main trend and thought of the novel. All things considered, she has done a difficult job well. There have been omissions, of course, as all of the book could not be put into a film of reasonable length, but the part of the story that is its reason for existence, the latter section dealing with the war, has been treated adequately and in the intense spirit of the original. The section dealing with South American life has been only sketched, though vividly in spots, and its chief character, the old centaur, Madariaga, has just been mentioned in passing, so to speak. The love affair between Julio and Marguerite and the character of Tchernoff have been considerably idealized, and the death of Julio has been made more melodramatic than it was in the novel. Also the spiritistic element, absent from the book, has been introduced into the photoplay, and another innovation, much less justifiable, is the bringing in of a pet monkey which has been made to act as if he definitely understands and sympathizes with the moods and situations of the human beings around him. Of course, trained animals do not do this, and the tricks of the monkey are simply broad comedy, entirely out of harmony with the rest of the story. It was felt, no doubt, that \\"comic relief\\" was desirable in so serious a work, and accordingly the incongruous animal was dragged in to supply the missing ingredient, but the added stuff does not accomplish the first business of an ingredient, which is to mix with the other ingredients of a compound. It is too bad that the adapters felt called upon to monkey with their material.When all is said about \\"The Four Horsemen,\\" however, the central fact remains that it is an exceptionally well done adaption of a novel, and an extraordinary motion picture work to boot.When an unsophisticated New England youth comes to Broadway and wins the love of a cabaret dancer, only to destroy her cherished ideals and a regular metropolitan white-wayfarer saves her from going to the devil by leading her to his gentle old mother and offering her honorable marriage—there's a story that has not been done to death and has just as many points of contact with life as the conventional version of the country boy public dancer-city fellow combination. It is the central idea of \\"The Gilded Lily,\\" at the Rivoli this week and despits its extravagances of action and treatment, the picture is generally interesting and has more real moments than most photoplays. Mae Murray, as the dancer, is entirely convincing, of course, when she's dancing, and surprisingly persuasive in a number of her many emotional scenes. Lowell Sherman, usually a villain immaculate in performance as well as appearance, is as finished a hero as could be desired, and Jason Robards, as the unstable New England youth who is fascinated by the dancer's gilt and glitter but loses interest in her when she wants to be his housekeeping wife, is as genuine as the fictional excesses of the photoplay permit.Robert Z. Leonard, who directed the production, seems to have appreciated the main points of the story, which was written by Clara Beranger, but, in treating it, has given it the oven-ornamentation which, in the movie trade, marks a picture as \\"special.\\" As a result, the photoplay is often interesting, but sometimes becomes ornate and incredible movie stuff. On the whole, it's above the average, however.Thomas H. Ince, with the likable House Peters and personable Florence Vidor at the head of his cast, and John Griffith Wray to direct under his supervision, has made a melodrama of considerable pictorial quality and some logic, if little originality, out of \\"Lying Lips,\\" which is at the Capitol this week. Mr. Ince has employed many tried and true theatrical ingredients, but has mixed them so skillfully that his production is likely to seem more real than it is. It is most real in the character of Nancy Abbott, a spoiled English girl who loves wealth and a man with character but no money. Miss Vidor makes the girl's struggle mean something. Often she seems to step out of the artificialities of the plot and become a human being. The solution of the heroine's problem does not come, however, until after the hero has inherited a nice fortune, which would seem to make the moral of the story run to the effect that girls should not discard poor young men too soon because they might become rich overnight.There are many well-made moving pictures in \\"Lying Lips,\\" although the shipwreck scene, for which advance promises were made his somewhat disappointing. Slow-motion photography is used in it, but the glimpses of the vessel's going down are so brief and cut up that suspense is not developed and sustained.The scenario of the picture was prepared by Bradley King from a story by May Edington.Whether one enjoys golf or not he can enjoy the latest Sport Pictorial from Grantland Rice and Jack Eaton, \\"The Happy Duffer,\\" also at the Capitol this week. It probably has fine points for the expert that the uninitiated cannot appreciate, but it has fun for everybody.\\"The Nut,\\" with Douglas Fairbanks, is at the Strand, and \\"Chickens,\\" with Douglas MacLean, is at the Rialto. \\"Buried Treasure,\\" with Marion Davies, remains at the Criterion.

For one, the tuna steak is coated with a mixture of curry powder, black pepper, anise, sesame seeds and salt. You might want to try variations on this mix, but I find that the curry and the anise have a great affinity, and the pepper gives it a lively kick. Second, the sesame seeds lend a pleasantly crunchy texture. If you cook over a barbecue grill, the sesame seeds will take on a lovely aromatic toastiness.

L. Rothapfel, maker of programs, is offering varied and, for most people, interesting entertainment this week. It is worth remarking, especially, that the well-made program does not suffer from poor pictures, as some of its predecessors have.After an elaborate opening number, composed of scenes from \\"Rigoletto,\\" with orchestral accompaniment, the first picture is \\"Some More Samoa,\\" a Chester-Outing travelogue, demonstrating, incidentally, that scenes of semi-savage life can be entertaining without the embellishment of home-made thrills. Katherine Hilliker wrote the bright leaders for the picture.A \\"Valse Caprice,\\" danced by Mlle. Gambarelli follows, and then the interesting Capitol News, with excellent views of the yacht races.The featured photoplay comes next. It is \\"Cupid, The Cowpuncher,\\" an adaptation of Eleanor Gates's \\"Alec Lloyd, Cowpuncher,\\" directed by Clarence G. Badger, with the always delightful Will Rogers in the leading rôle. Rogers is becoming, for many he has become, one of the established screen characters. His personality is a substantial thing, apparently, that can be photographed—at any rate, it emanates from his figure on the screen—and, contrary to rather the positive expectations of some, he has distinct pantomimic ability. His smile, his homeliness, his awkward manner, his odd gestures, are, of course, part of his make-up, but if they were an end in themselves they would soon become tiresome. Their charm is in the fact that they serve to convey thoughts and feelings","excerpt":"they are expressive. In other words, Rogers acts. He usually impersonates the same character—it may be himself—but he makes it live and have a meaning. It is genuine.In \\"Cupid, the Cowpuncher,\\" Alec Lloyd is a ranch foreman who is always managing some one else's marriage. Finally he falls in love himself, and finds matrimonial management more difficult than it had proved hitherto. But, of course, he is successful in the end—and every one is happy. That's all one needs to know about the story. Its excellence is in Rogers himself, Helene Chadwick, his heroine; Andrew Robson, one of his difficulties; Dr. Simpson, another obstacle, and others in the cast who suplpy action and atmosphere. Director Badger also makes a sizable contribution to the production.The concluding number on the program, shown only at 3:55 and 9 P. M., is \\"In the Land of the Sky-Blue Waters,\\" an effective combination of tableau, music and motion pictures.Photoplays with a foreign stamp, and more particularly those presenting life in the Orient, stir the interest unusually, even if their workmanship is not above the average of the home product, and for this reason, if there were no other, \\"The Breath of the Gods,\\" which opened at the Astor Theatre yesterday afternoon, would be of more than passing interest. It has what seems an authentic Japanese character—at least to one who has never been west of the Mississippi—chiefly through the work of Corley Z. Ito, who supervised the production, and Tsuro Aoki, the wife of the better-known Sussue Hayakawa, who has appeared with her husband in a number of pictures and is now coming out at the head of her own cast.But \\"The Breath of the Gods\\" does not depend upon its Oriental flavor to win friends. It is, in all departments, a work above the average. The director, Rolin Sturgeon, whose name, with those of most of the players, is omitted from the program, must be credited with skillful work, and the story, an adaption of a novel by Sidney McCall, gives opportunities for the acting of an excellent cast, including, especially, Tsuro Aoki, as the heroine; Stanhope Wheatcroft, as one who loves her not wisely but too well; Paul Weigel, as the Austrian Ambassador in Japan, and Andrew Carewe, as a Japanese Prince. Miss Aoki, if that is the way she should be designated, is not an altogether finished actress. Some of her gestures and expressions seem too studied and deliberate, too conscious of the camera, but, nevertheless, she has the quality of genuineness and succeeds in making the character of a Japanese girl influenced by unassimilated Western ideas consistently appealing.Although the story is essentially a melodrama, and Japanese perhaps only to those who do not know Japan, it seems real in many scenes. This is due not only to the acting and stage settings but to the narrative's simple directness and honest acceptance of a tragic ending. The death of a defeated Japanese girl may not seem tragic to some, but if the character is conceived of as the victim of conflicting customs, traditions and desires, represented chiefly in a man of the East and one of the West, there is tragedy in her life and death—and Yuki Onda is such a victim.\\"Crooked Streets,\\" with Ethel Clayton, is the photoplay at the Rivoli this week. \\"The Perfect Woman,\\" with Constance Talmadge, is at the Strand. \\"The Prince Chap,\\" with Thomas Meighan, which was at the Rivoli week before last, is now at the Rialto, and \\"Humoresque\\" is holding on at the Criterion.\\"Up in Mary's Attic,\\" supplemented by \\"A Beach Promenade\\" of girls in bathing suits, opens at B.

These tips for both city and suburban commuters were compiled from the Transit Authority, the New York City Transportation Department, and consumer transportation advocates. Leave early or late. The best times for getting a morning subway train are between 5 and 6 A.M., and between 9 and 10 A.M. The worst time is between 8 and 9 A.M. Going home, the best times are between 3 and 4 P.M., and between 7 and 8 P.M. The worst is from 5 to 6 P.M. Avoid the E and F subway lines from Jamaica to midtown Manhattan. These express lines, which generally provide the fastest and most convenient service to midtown, are already the most crowded in the city. Though they are the easiest to reach for many Long Island commuters, the Transit Authority is urging suburbanites to look elsewhere.   If you insist on heading to the first stations on the E, F or 7 lines, prepare to wait outside the stations until the police let you down the stairs. To keep masses of riders from holding open train doors, officers will be \\"metering\\" the crowds by restricting access to the platforms. Metering will also take place in the afternoons at the Fifth Avenue and Lexington Avenue stations on the E and F lines in Manhattan. Try the J and Z trains, which leave from Jamaica Center at Parsons Boulevard and Archer Avenue and head for lower Manhattan","excerpt":"they are generally under-used. Even if you're headed for midtown, it will be faster to take one of these trains and transfer to the uptown IRT at Chambers Street/Brooklyn Bridge. Second-best are the 7 line from Flushing to midtown and the A and C trains from southern Queens to downtown. These lines are already crowded, but not as much as the E and F trains. Charter buses ($5 from Nassau, $8 from Suffolk) will drop off Long Island commuters to the parking lots at Shea Stadium on the 7 and Kennedy International Airport on the A. Avoid transferring bewteen the 7 train and the E and F lines at 74th Street and Broadway in Queens, because there will be limited room on the trains and the police will be metering the crowds. The 7 train will be entirely local for the duration of the strike, which will mean more trains for riders at local stations but will annoy those used to an express ride.    And if the strike continues until the next day game at Shea Stadium on June 29, stay away from the stadium lot. Take local trains rather than expresses. The R train from Forest Hills to midtown will be more comfortable than the E and F trains on the same track. Subway riders in the Kew Gardens area are advised to walk or take a bus a few blocks west on Queens Boulevard to an R stop. Dress for the Tropics. Nearly all of the special buses to the Queens subway stops will be school buses without air conditioning. And there are likely to be far more people than tickets, so have a backup in mind. If you're driving in from Long Island, consider taking Jericho Turnpike, Route 25a and Sunrise Highway as alternatives to the Long Island Expressway, the Northern State Parkway and the Southern State Parkway. But be advised that less congested roads are likely to fill quickly. \\"Traffic is like water, it follows the path of least resistance,\\" said Melvin I. Cooperman, a State Transportation Department spokesman. Parking. Transportation officials say that if you must drive, try to leave the car in Queens of Brooklyn rather than driving into Manhattan. Long Island drivers who know Queens well can try parking on city streets near local stops on less-popular trains. Stephen Dobrow, president of the Committee for Better Transit, a consumer group, recommends driving to Astoria and taking the N train, or parking in Elmhurst or Woodside along the R line. To make these schemes easier, the city has suspended alternate-side parking in Queens and Brooklyn until the strike is over.   There are also inexpensive parking lots near Queens Center, downtown Jamaica and Queensborough Plaza that are adjacent to subway stops. But getting that far into Queens on jam-packed roads will be hard enough. And Robert Slovak, a T.A. spokesman, advises commuters not to cruise the streets of Queens aimlessly looking for a space. \\"Take a map,\\" he suggests. Don't think about Monday, Thursday and Friday will probably be bad but next week will probably be worse. Those who can skip work today and tomorrow will probably rejoin the commute by then.

This demographic imperative accounts for 70 percent of denominational change, according to calculations I published (with Andrew Greeley and Melissa Wilde) in the September 2001 issue of the American Journal of Sociology. The remaining 30 percent of denominational change stems from the growing efficiency of conservative denominations in holding on to their own.

The pictures are not pretty","excerpt":"they are hard, brutal and coarse. But they are real, too, and rather terribly fascinating if you can watch death in close-ups for an hour.One of the bouts of the show is a detailed struggle between a king snake and a rattler. The king strangles his somewhat larger opponent and swallows him alive in a slow and painful series of chews and gulps. There are seven preliminary events. Two land turtles fight it out in a bucking contest which ends when one is pushed over on his back and left to die in the sun. A centipede defeats a black widow spider in a brief and desperate struggle and then eats the paralyzed victim in a disturbing close-up which forced many in the Cameo's audience to turn their heads away.A gila monster kills a diamond back snake in a grueling contest of strangle-holds. A mongrel pit dog, in a contest which is reminiscent of the celebrated mongoose-cobra struggle, shakes the life out of a rattlesnake. A monkey-faced owl defeats a snake by the ingenious trick of prolonging the fight until the steaming Arizona sun kills his cold-blooded opponent. A ferret-like animal called the fitch corners a desert rat, but lets his enemy escape, and then tackles a rattlesnake with unhappy consequences.These isolated items have been strung like so many death-heads along an amateurish narrative dealing with the adventures of a camper in the Arizona desert.

''Curse of the Starving Class'' is, at the same time, Shepard's most comic and most excoriating study of the indomesticity of the American household, where isolated individuals spend hours staring at the bare inside of a refrigerator - the hearth of the contemporary home - and where everyone is plotting an escape.

For this moth-eaten bundle of horse feathers, in which Paulette Goddard and Fred MacMurray are rudely stuffed, is no more than a skit with pretensions, just another of those husband-wife things. It tells the story of a plainly foolish lawyer who wants a divorce from his wife, while she (silly girl that she is, obviously) doesn't want to give him one. So, for eighty-five minutes he tries vainly to persuade her with quaint contrivances, up to and including a performance as a show-off to embarrass her with her friends, and for eighty-five minutes she coquettes him with everything, including the old black negligee routine. In the last two minutes he remembers that they were really quite happy together once and, now that he can lift a ponderous barbell (which is suddenly dragged in), may be again.Even if Hollywood had not already run this husband-wife stuff into the ground, this silly exhibit of wrangling would still be in a rut.

This film comedy is deftly directed and cleverly acted, but the pivotal incident, one wherein a valet through jealousy of his gay master seeks an impossible revenge, is rather out of tune for the time being with the rest of the story. Subsequently, Mr. d'Arrast adroitly brings his photoplay back to its sophisticated allure.The team of d'Arrast and Menjou is an excellent one, for in his last two productions Mr. Menjou, under Mr. d'Arrast's direction, returns to the high mark he set in \\"The Grand Duchess and the Waiter,\\" from which he slumped through \\"The Ace of Cads\\" and \\"Evening Clothes.\\" On the program it is printed that this present film was adapted from Roy Horniman's story, \\"Bellamy, the Magnificent.\\" It is a subject that affords Mr. Menjou singular opportunities and Mr. d'Arrast reveals imagination in his direction. Like most of Mr. Menjou's good productions, it has intelligent fun with decided characterizations. Lawrence Grant, as General Latour-Latour, by a mere look, and a natural one at that, yesterday afternoon stirred up as much merriment as that created by any of the other scenes.Here one finds a French Marquis, who often tells his valet, Joseph, that he wonders what he would do without him. It happens in the opening chapter of this chronicle that the Marquis, as is not unusual, has been out all night. The General and his daughter, Jacqueline, who is engaged to marry the Marquis, come to Paris to visit the noble night-hawk. Joseph telephones to various fair creatures who are not unknown to the Marquis in an effort to locate his master, but without result. Finally the Marquis drives up to his home, and on learning that the peppery General and Jacqueline are waiting for him he speedily takes off his dress clothes and refreshes himself under a shower. The valet shaves his master and the latter pokes his face through the curtains of the shower bath. A few explanations and everything goes well.The Marquis is a lucky gambler and his prospective bride is averse to his dallying with the cards. The Marquis is also a facile talker, and quite often he prevails upon Jacqueline to let him play for half an hour, and in that time it is not unusual for this scion of an old French family to win 100,000 francs.Trouble arises through Joseph discovering that the light-hearted Marquis is quite struck by the very girl with whom Joseph, himself, is infatuated. This calls for a most amusing sequence, in which Joseph is sharpening the razor to shave the Marquis, who is quite a little concerned as to what Joseph might do with the razor if the thought occurred to him. Nevertheless, the Marquis risks his throat as the valet handles the razor, but during the conversation Joseph, who, of course, knows how necessary he is to his master, declares, as he wipes the soap off the razor blade, that there is more than one way of cutting a throat.The valet takes his own means for revenge, and the consequence is that the Marquis is denounced as a card cheat. General Latour-Latour is only too ready to lend the Marquis his revolver so that he (the Marquis) can sever this mortal coil. The throng of persons down below are all awaiting the report of the pistol. They are not worried about the Marquis","excerpt":"they are merely curious as to whether he will or will not shoot himself.Needless to say that even if the author had insisted on this gentleman of Paris destroying himself Mr. Menjou and his producers would have frowned upon such a climax. So it is not revealing any secret to say that the Marquis fires a shot, but not so as to endanger himself or any one else.John Murray Anderson's stage contribution, \\"Dance Caprice,\\" possesses action and originality.

The hourlong program itself is divided between Palestinian and Israeli, with the first half given to the enduring leader of the Palestine Liberation Organization, who seems almost to have shaved for the occasion. Despite a little talk-show vaporing (\\"But that's the dream that's never left you,\\" Mr. Frost prompts Mr. Arafat about Palestinian claims to Jerusalem), the program does get into several prickly subjects.   On Jerusalem, Mr. Arafat, whose spotty English requires Mr. Frost to repeat some answers, proposes making the contested city the joint capital of Israel and a Palestinian state. For some reason, Mr. Frost does not elicit the Israeli Prime Minister's opinion of any such innovation. Nor does he ask Mr. Arafat about his intentions toward the Jewish settlements in Gaza, which Mr. Rabin maintains \\"are going to stay","excerpt":"they are not going to be uprooted.\\"   Although Mr. Rabin avows his commitment to successful negotiations, he does not exude as much confidence as his new television partner, who announces more than once, \\"Where there's a will, there's a way.\\" To one interesting question -- what would the newly organized Palestinian police force do if a Palestinian should shoot an Israeli -- Mr. Arafat replies, \\"Sorry, we are not speaking about small issues.\\"   Among the issues that Mr. Rabin does not consider small is whether, as Mr. Arafat holds, an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho represents the beginning of a Palestinian state or whether, as Mr. Rabin views it, the withdrawal is only \\"an interim agreement that leaves the future open.\\" They also disagree on which side will control the borders of the territories in question.   Both men assure Mr. Frost that they can manage the opponents among their own people to any agreement, but Mr. Rabin expresses skepticism about Mr. Arafat's ability to bring into line groups like Hamas, which are continuing to attack Israelis. The Prime Minister observes in his flat bass: \\"They deny the right of Israel to exist. They opposed the very peace negotiations. They are against the agreement.\\"   The two leaders display different styles. Mr. Arafat is more the showman; he speaks of himself as a martyr. Mr. Rabin is the Jewish Al Gore. But in their different ways, both leaven hope with wariness as they edge toward what Mr. Rabin calls \\"calculated risks for peace.\\"   Their appearance tonight makes plain, in case there was any doubt, that despite Mr. Arafat's waving away of what he calls \\"small issues,\\" the road to peace in the Middle East is still a minefield of details as well as principles.

The situation, however, is decidedly out of the ordinary, because the pupils in the well-appointed mobile home classroom are the juvenile stars of the popular television comdey series \\"Home Improvement.\\"    \\"Do we have to do school now?\\" whines Zachery Ty Bryan, 12 years old, who portrays Brad, the eldest son. \\"I don't want to do these stupid lessons.\\" Steve Elster ignores Zachery's lament and plunges into a lecture on how amino acids contribute to hereditary cell defects. As a studio teacher, Mr. Elster is one of a cadre of professional hybrids on whom children like Zachery depend. In order to do their jobs well, Mr. Elster and his co-teacher, Daphne Boelsma, must be by turns tutors, friends, therapists, protectors and surrogate parents for their young charges.   While California minors toil making commercials, acting in television shows or movies, those who haven't graduated from high school must go to school three hours a day, 15 hours a week. Although all states require a minimum number of hours of instruction for children working in the entertainment industry, only California law specified that even when a child's educational needs have been met, a state-certified studio teacher must be present on the set, serving as guardian of his or her health and safety, even during summer vacations.    With children so prevalent in movies and television the last few years, studio teachers have not been faced with the intermittent unemployment that plagued them in the past. Hired by production companies from a roster maintained by the teachers' union, they earn more than public school employees when they do work -- though considerably less than their students do.    Children who work have to be registered in accredited school, and the curriculum covered by their studio teacher is determined by their school of record. Students with continuing jobs, such as roles on television series, sometimes don't actually visit the schools at which they are nominally enrolled","excerpt":"they are often in independent study programs, which were developed for pregnant students trying to keep up with their lessons while out of school. Rare Visits to 'Regular School'    Zachery, a sixth grader, and his two television brothers call their home schools \\"regular school,\\" an apt term since studio schooling is predictably irregular. Some children study with a studio teacher only a few days a year while appearing in commercials, while others spend several months making a movie or miniseries. And since many situation comedies schedule a break one week each month, the youngsters in their casts can return to their home schools periodically.    Jonathan Taylor Thomas, 12, a sixth grader who plays Randy, the middle son in 'Home Improvement,\\" says: \\"A lot of kids at my regular school don't understand. They go, 'Oh, you're so lucky. You don't have to go to school.' It's not like that. We do the same exact work that the public schools do, but sometimes it's more difficult because we have to do it in a shorter amount of time.\\"    Studio teachers maintain contact with their students' home-school teachers, getting copies of texts used and tests given. In many cases, they fax or mail work done on the set to the classroom teacher. For a junior high or high school student, they will keep track of work assigned by as many as six different teachers.    The goal of most studio teachers is to keep students academically up to grade level and personally down to earth. Mr. Elster's dry sense of humor surfaces when his pubescent scholars sound inappropriately mature. \\"I like being on this show because I know I have a steady job,\\" 12-year-old Jonathan tells a visitor. \\"Right,\\" Mr. Elster adds. \\"He has the ex-wives, the alimony, the mortgage to worry about.\\"    How well studio schooling works depends on how important education is to the parents involved. Parents who value learning communicate that ethic to their children, who work hard in school even while they're busy acting. Conversely, the unmotivated student typically comes from a family more interested in a child's earning potential than in his acquisition of knowledge.    Arlene Singer-Gross has been a studio teacher for 15 years, 8 of them on the long-running comedy \\"Who's the Boss?\\" \\"I've worked with parents whose priority was, 'How come my child didn't get a close-up and the other child did?' rather than 'Can she read?\\"' said Ms. Singer-Gross.    She briefly taught a 16-year-old whose parents considered education a necessary evil. They were eager for the boy to take his high school proficiency exam so he could work longer hours as an actor. \\"He had gotten the message,\\" Ms. Singer-Gross said. \\"It wasn't like he wanted to do homework; he wanted to do his publicity photos. I felt in that situation, my job was to teach him life skills. I taught him how to write a check, how to balance a checkbook.\\"    By law, California studio teachers may work with a maximum of 10 students, but the student-teacher ratio is usually one or two to one. As in Ms. Singer-Gross's experience, opportunities to tailor programs to a student's needs are abundant. \\"I can take a child in the seventh grade and have him reading Shakespeare, if he's that advanced,\\" she says. \\"Or if a child is having a hard time with the multiplication tables, I can work on that for three days, design an approach just for him, or turn the math lesson into a game.\\"    Actors and actresses are the beneficiaries of the societal assumption that because a person is attractive and personable, he or she is bright. \\"I've taught some wonderful, sweet kids who were great when it was time for them to do their scenes, but they were struggling in school,\\" says Laura Gary, a studio teacher who went on location when the movie \\"Free Willy\\" was filmed, and is currently working on \\"Full House,\\" one of the television comedies that started the trend to family shows with young cast members. She enjoys being able to explain and drill until a subject is mastered, without worrying about boring the faster learners that inhabit a large, heterogeneous classroom.    Zachery of \\"Home Improvement\\" says, \\"You get a lot more accomplished on the set because it's one on one with the teacher, not one on thirty. The teacher doesn't have to wonder about me not understanding something, because if I don't I'll just tell her. If I get it right away, we can just go on to the next thing.\\"    Studio teachers are as aware of a student's moods as his academic strengths and weaknesses. Although one of the professional child's survival skills is adaptability, the actor who goes directly from performing a very emotional scene to grappling with geometric proofs might not have an easy time making the switch. \\"When they come into the schoolroom from the set, I try to give them a cooling-off period,\\" Ms. Singer-Gross says. \\"I might encourage them to talk about the experience they went through and how they internalized it, or instead of doing math, which takes more concentration, I give them an assignment to read for a while, so they can calm themselves down.\\"    When she isn't making a movie like \\"The Addams Family\\" or its sequel, 14-year-old Christina Ricci attends a suburban public school in New Jersey. For the four months she will work on the upcoming film \\"Casper\\" (about the friendly ghost), school is a one-room trailer that she has adorned with a Red Hot Chili Peppers poster, berthed on the Universal Studios lot. Although there are desks in the trailer, Christina can lie on the floor, pop a tape into her cassette player and drink a soda while she completes her assignments. \\"Here I call my teacher Rhona,\\" she said. \\"In regular school, it would be Ms. Gordon.\\" That reflects the rapport and trust that frequently, and rewardingly, develop between student and studio teacher.    Like the private tutors once engaged for children of privileged class, studio teachers, by virtue of the intimacy and variety of situations they share with their students, inevitably impart more than the basics. When a teacher and student eat dinner together on location, a number of teachers say they can't help but notice a child's table manners and would be inclined to correct them if the need were obvious.    Everyone expects that addition, subtraction and the causes of the Civil War will be covered in school. But questions of values that may not arise in regular classrooms are inescapable in an environment that is part school, part glamorous workplace.    \\"There is no other business that tolerates the kind of behavior you see in this one -- spoiled, demanding behavior,\\" Ms. Gordon says. \\"It happens with adults, teen-agers and young children. I've worked with children who were supporting their families and the balance of power was off. It got to be, like, who's running the store here? The kid was used to controlling everybody, and I felt it was up to me to teach him to treat adults with respect, because no one else had done it.\\"    But while it is inevitable for studio teachers to take on a variety of roles in their students' lives, including buddy and confidant, often what a young person really wants in a friend is someone the same age with the same interests, fears and curiosities.    Lecy Goranson portrayed the eldest daughter on the top-rated television show \\"Roseanne\\" from age 13 to 18, and during that time, she said, she craved friends in her own age group. Ms. Goranson attended Vassar her freshman year, and at 19 is currently taking night classes at the University of California at Los Angeles. \\"When I went to college,\\" she said, \\"I was better prepared in some ways than my peers, because I was always around adults on 'Roseanne,' and that was a very advanced learning experience.\\"    \\"But I think I missed out being isolated,\\" she continued. \\"Even though my TV sister, Sara Gilbert, is really smart, there were still just the two of us in a little room. There was no recess, no walking from one class to the next where you would see other kids. You don't learn just from books or from your teacher. You learn from other students, too, from hearing what they have to say. When I think about having sat in the same room for hours and hours every day for five years -- the closest parallel I can draw is a prison.\\"    The 7-year-old stars of \\"Full House,\\" Ashley and Mary-Kate Olsen, \\"do school\\" in a blue-carpeted second floor schoolroom inside a Burbank sound stage that is windowless, but hardly prison-like. The saucer-eyed twins (identical except for temporarily differing patters of baby tooth loss) sit on the flowered cushion of a white wicker loveseat taking turns ready a picture book, \\"Josefina Finds the Prince,\\" aloud with their teacher, Ms. Gary. A rehearsal for \\"Full House\\" is going on directly below, on the permanent set for Uncle Jesse's attic apartment. Growing Up on 'Full House'    The twins have shared the pivotal role of Michelle since they were nine months old. They have thus virtually grown up on \\"Full House,\\" and their parents, acting coach and teachers have made special efforts to infuse the twins' lives with elements of normalcy, including ballet classes for Ashley and riding lessons for her sister. The show films on a four-day workweek, so the girls attend separate second-grade classes at a private school on Mondays and every fourth week, when the show is on hiatus. To eace the transition between the two school settings, Ms. Gary has deliverately made herself less available in her classroom, prohibiting questions from her two students in the middle of a test, for example.    The attempt to foster autonomy makes sense, but it seems to be an uphill battle. When Ms. Gary previews a nutrition test that will have to be completed and sent to their school (\\"Which picture shows a balanced meal?\\"), the girls, natural cuddlers, get up from their Lilliputian desks and each cling to one of her arms as they study the material.    Independence, manners, spelling, a sense of persective about show business and single-cell reproduction -- if children in studio school learn all their lessons, they have the chance to avoid what every child dreads, being different. \\"I've met kids in this business who have never been around kids their own age and they don't know how to relate to them,\\" Christina Ricci says. \\"It's weird.\\" Teachers to the (Child) Stars"},{"year":"1993","title":"Joan Mitchell   Robert Miller Gallery  41 East 57th Street  Manhattan  Through May 8    This is among the most beautiful gallery shows in a long while and a fitting tribute to one of the leading second-generation Abstract Expressionists.

In \\"Phyllis,\\" the only work on view from 1991, not 1992, Mitchell paints in broad, almost blunt strokes that seem to be pushed and pulled across the canvas.

An increase in corporate taxes so that business will bear a ''fair share'' of the national tax burden will run the serious risk of curtailing jobs, growth and capital formation.

Does Mr. Campbell expect the historian - whose quest, after all, is for truths and facts (even if, in that pursuit, he or she sometimes succumbs to passionate indignation over historical injustices) - to perform the tasks of the politician or of the diplomat? And have heads of states and other negotiators not failed in their undertakings perhaps precisely because of their ignorance of, or contempt for, such truths and facts as Joan Peters brings to light?    Mr. Campbell also seems to equate evenhandedness with ''recognition'' (if not an outright condoning) of Britain's self-interest during World War II, when victory ''took precedence over efforts to mitigate the tragedy of the Jews of Europe.'' Yet the reviewer questions Mrs. Peters's objectivity when she does grant recognition - but a recognition of the priorities of the Jews in their efforts for survival in the ancestral homeland.

OUTDOORS: ON WATERFOWLING IN NORTH CAROLINA"},{"year":"1933","title":"EVERY few months Paris, like all other great film centres, has the opportunity of hailing a really important picture, one which stands out head and shoulders above the usual run, and therefore makes film history. Such a picture has just been released here after months of genuinely interested expectation on the part of both critics and the public. It is G. W. Pabst's \\"Don Qui-chotte,\\" with Feodor Chaliapin in the title rôle.For one thing, any film produced by Pabst is certain to be a source of keen interest and discussion. This is his first production since \\"L'Atlantide,\\" about six months ago. There is no mistaking the Pabst \\"signature,\\" any more than one could fail to realize in a moment that one is seeing a René Claire film in looking at \\"Quatorze Juillet.\\" Pabst never does shoddy or unintelligent work.That the part of Don Quixote should have been played by Chaliapin was another important reason for being interested in the picture. This is the Russian basso's introduction to the screen, for though he admits to a small part in a silent film many years ago it was before he had reached the fullness of his powers and his fame, and long before he had a chance to employ his magnificent voice as well as his ability to act.However one may like and even admire motion pictures generally, not even its stanchest champion could deny that many a beloved and revered classic of literature has been brutally maltreated on the screen. This has been true to such an extent that one approaches a film based on such a classic with fear and trembling. The thought of what could have been done to Cervantes's book by less reverent and intelligent hands than Pabst's and Chaliapin's is enough to give one shudders. Even so, a certain amount of criticism has been aroused by the scenario which Paul Morand and M. Arnoux prepared for the film.A Difficult Undertaking.That they had a thankless and virtually hopeless task, there is no denying. The wealth of material in the book, the multiplicity of incidents, the loose structure of the plot, and the undramatic ending which has lost its point for us now that the vogue for books on chivalry has been out of fashion for three centuries—all these things make adaptation for the screen an extremely difficult task. What the scenarists have done is to pick out certain of the more famous incidents, to shuffle them about a bit so as to make the charging of the windmills the climax of the film instead of one of the early, minor events of the history, to radically revamp the scenes in the ducal court, and, above all, to rewrite the ending entirely.It was on the last score—of changing the ending—that the only note of hostile comment was aroused among the critics. As a matter of fact, it is difficult not to consider the ending as a glaring example of just that sort of maltreatment of literature which has turned so many booklovers against the screen—but it is only a minor fault in what is certainly an admirable film. The producers, in any case, are not thinking of the few spectators who have read \\"Don Quixote\\" and remember its ending","excerpt":"they are playing to a public with those vague ideas about the hero which have crept into popular belief and into all languages, a public which presumably likes dramatic endings, coûte que coûte.The picture opens with Don Quixote, his head turned by reading books of chivalry, determining to set out with his trusty Sancho Panza on the quest of adventure. We see him caparisoning himself, getting knighted, swearing fidelity to his Dulcinea, and setting off on Rosinante for those ludicrous and pitiful adventures Cervantes tells about. The Duke, Governor of the province, tries to cure him by feeding his folly, but Don Quixote learns he has been duped and rides haughtily away. It is then (on the screen) that he encounters the windmills that appear to him to be giants and, gallantly charging them, is caught on one of the wings, lifted from his horse and carried helplessly around. When finally taken off he is grievously hurt, and is carried back in a cage to his native town amid the jeers and mockery of the citizens. There he finds that his niece, the curé and Carrasco are burning his precious library, and, broken in body and spirit, he dies. The book, however, in which his story is told comes back to life from the flames.Poetry and Pathos.To quarrel with the disposition of the story would be rather fruitless. Whatever the scenarists had done would have brought criticism, and the important thing is that Pabst and Chaliapin between them have brought Don Quixote back to life in all his tragic beauty. The sureness with which Chaliapin has caught the eternal spirit of the \\"Caballero de la Triste Figura\\" is something to glory in. The gentleness, the poetry, the pity and the courage of the man, tilting high-heartedly against cruelty and ugliness and injustice, carries that same inspiration which comes to the solitary reader evoking the figure of Don Quixote from the pages of that great book. Chaliapin, with the certainty of genius, has grasped just those qualities which have made Don Quixote de la Mancha eternal, and has conveyed them to us from the screen.It was Pabst's part to fill in the background and furnish the medium whereby this Don Quixote was to be introduced to the public, and he has done it with his usual consummate artistry. There are scenes in this picture of breath-taking loveliness, and, best of all, there is an atmosphere which conveys the spirit of the times and the story without the slightest jar to one's sensibilities.The music for the picture (there are a great many opportunities for Chaliapin to use his singing voice) was written by Jacques Ibert. It, too, is an effort to recapture the spirit of the book, and it has generally been recognized as a commendable one. However, for some reason or other it is music that sounds strange to our ears today, and for that reason a certain amount of criticism has been aroused. Some of the critics found it distracting, rather than an integral part of the story.Finally, it would be unfair not to mention the splendid characterization of Sancho Panza by Dorville, one of the great comedians of the French stage. He is excruciatingly funny, and at times runs away with the picture. Though one is generally too cognizant of the fact that he is a French comedian, rather than the good-hearted, faithful, incredibly stupid Sancho, he makes an excellent foil for Chaliapin.All in all, it is a great picture in the French version. There is also going to be an English one, with Chaliapin still playing the leading rôle but with George Robey as Sancho Panza. It is doubtless the English version which New York will see, but one need not expect anything very much different in its fundamentals.

If Mrs. Ostriker had intended yet another survey (there are plenty already), then Ms. Rosenberg would have a valid criticism, but Mrs. Ostriker's closely reasoned thesis is that women's poetry did not emerge as a genre, as a group activity, as an entity with discernible form and structure, until recent years.

Remember that guy - John somebody?''   At first glance, this scrap of conversation isn't very illuminating, and it certainly doesn't seem inherently musical. But Scott Johnson, a composer and electric guitarist who is performing with his ensemble at the Dance Theater Workshop next Monday and Tuesday, has used this snatch of dialogue as the basis for a composition more than 28 minutes long, the title piece on his new album ''John Somebody'' (Nonesuch).   Mr. Johnson's music bristles with the sounds of contemporary America - the stinging whine of electric guitars, the vocalized chattering of saxophones, the overlaid complexities of multitrack recordings. The composer, who played the guitar in various rock bands when he was a student at the University of Wisconsin in Madison, says that ''the music I'm doing is based on a love of the sounds and instruments of rock.'' But while Mr. Johnson's sound world will be familiar to anyone who listens to rock, his compositional methods are hardly standard fare. And comparing his work withi the music of Glen Branca or Rhys Chatham, also downtown composers who write for electric guitars, would be misleading.

For this latest feature-length picture from the Disney atelier is peculiarly like a basket of assorted Easter eggs—vivid, motley, ornamental and just-a-bit questionable in spots. Into one hour and fifteen minutes Mr. Disney and his dexterous crew have packed ten distinctive cartoon subjects of varying character and length, some of them thoroughly delightful and some of them ponderous and dull. No artistic pattern associates the lot. They are just so many short subjects. You pays your money, and you takes your pick.To this writer's taste, the best item, for sheer artistic delight, is the briefest one in the assortment. It is a brilliant abstraction wherein fanciful musical instruments dance gayly on sliding color disks, sets of romping fingers race blithely down tapes of piano keys and musical notes fly wildly through the multi-hued atmosphere—all to the tingling accompaniment of Benny Goodman's quartet playing the ancient and melodious torch song, \\"After You're Gone.\\" Color, form and music blend dynamically in this bit, and a rich stimulant of sensuous rhythm is excitingly achieved. A less subtle musical diversion but a characterful one, withal, is a cartoon burlesque, backed by the orchestra of Mr. Goodman playing \\"All the Cats Join In.\\"In the popular style of Mr. Disney's familiar story cartoons are the five most dominant items—and two of those are tops. A stylized illustration of the old poem, \\"Casey at the Bat,\\" with Jerry Colonna reciting, is a strikingly funny skit and we highly recommend you keep a close watch for that sneer that \\"curled Casey's lip.\\" Also observe those base runners","excerpt":"they are real Disney imps of the perverse. The second amusing cartoon fable is \\"The Whale That Wanted to Sing at the Met,\\" which tells of a fabulous cetacean with a triple-gaited voice. No less a star than Nelson Eddy provides the sound track for this event, which presents a temptation for a wise-crack that we will quietly avoid.A lengthy little whimsey based on Prokofieff's \\"Peter and the Wolf\\" will probably delight the kiddies—except for the horrendous wolf. It was just a bit sticky for our taste. And a silly romance between two hats is sketched to the Andrews Sisters' warbling of \\"Johnny Fedora and Alice Bluebonnet.\\" A passel of gangly hill-billies feud amusingly in \\"The Martins and the Coys,\\" done to a rambling guitar ballad, but the draftsmanship here is confused.As for three musical interludes—\\"Without You,\\" which Andy Russell sings; \\"Blue Bayou,\\" sung by the Ken Darby Chorus, and \\"Two Silhouettes,\\" a dance routine—they are dubious animations of song-slide and valentine art. The best excuse to be made for them is that the picture needed footage for full length, so Mr. Disney, who must have winked anyhow at this mélange, just threw them in.

Miss Griffith is charming as Lady Helen Haden, the rôle made famous before the footlights by Ethel Barrymore. While the film does not approach the artistic stage production, it is nevertheless an entertaining effort, which might have been infinitely more worthy if the producers had not pandered to what they believe is provincial popular taste.The story is one which needed delicate handling and studious care, and the standardized ideas of movies ought to have been avoided. Although Robert Vignola, the director, has restrained himself in a measure, he has introduced old ideas in certain sequences, especially a prolonged kiss, which reminded us of that line in Mandalay: \\"With 'er cheek ag'in my cheek.\\" Butlers appear to be treated as if some day they might be social climbers, and the principals' utterances are written in a verbose fashion, mindful of characters of popular novels.Lady Helen Haden, who is descended from the \\"Mad Varricks of England,\\" is an unfortunate woman who is married to a knighted parvenu, Sir Bruce Haden. He never misses an opportunity to saturate himself with port, and his actions are unspeakably offensive. Perhaps Lady Helen would have fallen in love with any good-looking young man who chanced to cross her path, but nevertheless, her sudden infatuation for Ned Thayer, a young American, is rather startling. Mrs. Leslie threatens to reveal the contents of a letter Thayer has written to Lady Helen, and to pacify Mrs. Leslie, Thayer consents to cheat at cards with the hope of winning a high stake. It ends in Thayer's exposure and being forced to leave Sir Bruce's home. Mrs. Leslie later reads the letter to Sir Bruce and his guests, thus bringing disgrace upon Lady Helen.Subsequently Lady Helen is seen with her faithful maid in the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in New York. Her bill is six weeks overdue, and she is pursued by Rudolph Solomon, a wealthy and utterly unscrupulous person. Lady Helen refuses Solomon's attentions, in spite of his protestations of affection, or rather admiration, and when Lady Helen, weakened by circumstances, goes to his home, he shows her the portrait of her ancestor. Lady Joan Varrick, which he had bought from Sir Bruce.Some of the passages in New York are effective, but the comedy furnished by two actors at the boarding house is exaggerated. They go to Solomon's home, and, when the butler extends the tray for their cards, they think that he wants a tip. At a dinner party to which Lady Helen had invited these comedians, known as the Waltons, the antics of the couple are beyond anything that one would expect to happen. They are more than awkward","excerpt":"they are ridiculous. Lady Helen takes the check for the party and, with her last diamond ring around it, gives it in payment to the head waiter, who had known her in her more fortunate days in the Savoy, in London.Rockliffe Fellowes plays the part of Sir Bruce, who attacks his wife when he wants to kiss her. He twists her arm, and then she sweetly embraces him. Mr. Fellowes is a splendid actor, but he has been forced to overdo the coarseness. He slaps women on the arm at dinner and is hardly ever what one might generously term sober.Miss Griffith's performance is creditable. She has, however, been almost too obedient to the director, and more spontaneity would have improved certain scenes in which she appears. There is no denying her loveliness and her graceful carriage. In this picture, for the first time, she is careful to close her lips occasionally, and therefore her facial attraction is even more appealing.The villain, Solomon, is impersonated by Clive Brook, who shows himself an efficient actor. Lloyd Hughes is a little too theatric in most of the scenes. He figures as Ned Thayer, the young man to whom Lady Helen loses her heart.In the introduction to this picture the story goes back to the days of long ago, when Lady Joan Varrick, who had vexed the King, is ordered to he beheaded. So one has the opportunity of seeing the beauteous Miss Griffith walking up the scaffold to the block and kneeling down like Lady Jane Grey of old.

Why me? I protested. My knowledge of kosher cuisine was nil. I was French, raised in a convent. I knew nothing of Jewish tradition, possessed no childhood memories to help me conjure up recipes. The little I knew was that kosher cooking was often overdone, heavy, high in cholesterol and, above all, unimaginative. But, I was told, nowhere is it written that this should be so. I learned that there are a growing number of young people who, while not brought up in a kosher tradition, are now keeping a kosher home.

This was a challenge I could not turn down.   For months, I studied the laws and traditions of kosher cuisine.

I assembled ingredients such as French spices, soy sauce, Agar-agar (the clear gelatin made from seaweed), dashi (the Japanese fish broth) and sauces made with vegetables and fruits. I sought meats and poultry at kosher butchers and combed the city to find kosher supermarkets. I replaced cream with soft bean curd and used fragrant oils instead of butter.

Many novices are more concerned with color schemes than species, and interested only in the limited number of plants that will survive their uncertain ministrations.

It put the simple question of \\"What film, in 1931, interested you most?\\" to 100 Parisian personalities, receiving 92 answers. As was to be expected. René Clair's \\"A Nous la Libertê\\" won hands down, with Jean Choux's \\"Jean de la Lune\\" a not very close but decided second.One could hardly question these choices","excerpt":"they are the obvious ones, and it is gratifying to know that New York audiences have had the opportunity to see both of them recently. They are the proof of the fine quality and capabilities of the French screen—pictures universal in the scope of their appeal and yet basically French.There is no need to say anything more about René Clair's film. Like \\"Le Million\\" and \\"Sous les Toits de Paris,' New York and London have heard almost as much praise of it as Paris. But, for some reason or other, \\"Jean de la Lune\\" seems to have met with a cold reception on the other side of the Atlantic.A Detective Thriller.Paris, for instance, has just had the opportunity to see a detective thriller as good as anything you could expect America to produce. It is called \\"Au Nom de la Loi\\" (In the Name of the Law) and was taken from the novel by Paul Bringuer.The story is about a drug ring and the finally successful efforts of the Paris police to break it up. A young detective goes into a den in Paris's Chinatown, following a clue, and that is the last seen of him until his body is found floating in the Seine several days later. The only clue is a woman's glove. The dead man's friends on the force vow to avenge him, and receive information leading them to suspect one Sandra, a beautiful foreigner, played by the stunning Marcelle Chantal.She flees to Marseilles, where she has an affair with a young man named Marcel, whom she takes to an opium den. There they are joined by Bullack, the head of the band, who orders Sandra back to Paris. Marcel, who turns out to be a detective, cannot bring himself to betray Sandra to his associates, but in trying to involve Bullack alone he falls into a trap which ends in the death of Bullack after a most exciting battle with the police, and the suicide of Sandra, who had come to love Marcel and felt life wasn't worth living if he had betrayed her.An even more interesting basis of comparison with Hollywood, however, is the French version of \\"The Little Accident,\\" which as a play did so well for itself a few years ago in New York. It emerges as a most charmingly amusing film, which is as French as it could be. The name now is \\"Papa sans la Savoir\\" (A Father Without Knowing It).The plot should not need more than a brief mention. On the day of his marriage a young ne'er-do-well learns that he is a father and that the mother, a young mistress he had abandoned, was going to have the baby adopted by a rich woman. The finance drops his marriage unceremoniously, steals the infant from the maternity home and decides to work in order to support his child. Six months later the mother of the baby forgives him and his parents do the same.This is not quite the plot of \\"The Little Accident,\\" for one thing, the French scenario and dialogue being left in the expert hands of Yves Mirande, whose laudable purpose was to make the picture as French as possible. The Parisian atmosphere and French cast do the rest. Noel-Noel as the young father and Françoise Rosay as his irate mother give superb performances, so that, all in all, the film is now one of the biggest hits in Paris.\\"Truly French.\\"But to come back to the real point under discussion, with remarkable unanimity the critics called the picture \\"Truly French,\\" \\"Really French\\" and words to that effect. Only one of them, however, explained what he meant by it.\\"I understand by that,\\" he wrote, \\"that it is only with us French that one can carry on a plot of this type without false sentimentality—a dialogue where one can put malice in replies which too much seriousness would make ridiculous, where one knows how to delineate living and moving characters, where, finally, one endows all the characters with an intelligence subtle enough to prevent them ever becoming puppets.\\"Apropos of that, there is a type of picture which must also be equally French, since it takes Frenchmen to appreciate and enjoy it. One such cropped up here about ten days ago—\\"Aux Urnes, Citoyens!\\" (To the Polls, Citizens!). It is what one critic called \\"an amiable satire on our political customs, which uncovers the little foibles of those who were, and perhaps will be, our idols, with the best of humor.\\"It does, indeed, do that, to give the devil his due, and the audience did seem to be getting a mild, but steady, degree of amusement out of it. But the only conclusion that two bored foreigners, who could not even see it through to the end, were able to draw was that one would have to know and care a lot about French politics to appreciate its humor.Very briefly put, it is the story of a rich manufacturer whom an unscrupulous politician induces to run for Deputy. His vanity makes him an easy prey, and leads him into all sorts of ridiculous situations, until he learns how he has been duped, whereupon we see him at the end a sadder and wiser man.At the \\"Boxy.\\"Our own \\"Roxy\\" Theatre reopened here after a complete transformation into one of Paris's most beautiful motion picture houses. The first picture shown is \\"La Fortune,\\" by that veteran of the stage and screen, Tristan Bernard. It is by no means typical of his best, but he is such an expert at amusing his audiences, both with funny situations and the malicious wittiness of his dialogue, that one ends by being reasonably well entertained.It is a variation of the old story of trying to break the bank at Monte Carlo, with the invariable lack of success. The effort is made by two young cousins— a boy and a girl—and a chaperon, who is more foolish than the youngsters. One sees them playing at the roulette table, and the next time they show up they are street singers, trying to pick up enough to eat.

PARIS SCREEN NOTES"},{"year":"1997","title":"HERZOG-Chaim. The entire Boys Town Jerusalem family joins with the family of Israel in mourning the passing of Chaim Herzog, the sixth President of Israel. We remain inspired by the remarks he made after his visit to Boys Town. ''The things I saw here today convince me that Boys Town Jerusalem is truly unique. This outstanding institution of Torah and technology gives its students not only a comprehensive education but a sense of respect and love for the People and the State of Israel. Behind the name of Boys Town Jerusalem rests an exalted conceptone which brings together the youths of all tribes of Israel and unites them in the spirit of the Torah, 'whose ways are ways of pleasantness and whose paths are all of peace.' Here, one learns not to shut oneself in, not to be isolated from the community of Israel, but rather to be an involved, creative and responsible citizen of Israel as it takes the first steps on the road to redemption. If there is any development that should give us cause for concern, it is the splintering of the Jewish People into sects and groups of all kinds. At Boys Town Jerusalem, I have found a source of hope I have found a source of hope for unity and love between the different parts of the Jewish People. The students of Boys Town Jerusalem leave here strengthened in their Torah and in their faith, able to identify heart and soul with the building of the State of Israel, and appreciative of the contributions of all segments of our nation, without exception, to Israel's redemption. Boys Town Jerusalem's graduates are spread throughout the land. They have fought in the ranks of the Israel Defense Forces, shoulder to shoulder with their brothers from cities, villages and kibbutzim. Many have fallen in battle, and their names are inscribed forever in the hearts of our People. In the weekly portion of the Prophets, we read: 'And the people shall all be righteous and they shall inherit the land forever","excerpt":"they are the offshoots of My plantings, the glorious works of My hands. The small shall grow into thousands, and the young shall become a mighty nation. These wonderful verses are fitting to be said of Boys Town Jerusalem. May there indeed be more of you.'' May there be many more like Chaim Herzog. May the Almighty comfort his family among the mourners of Zion and Jersualem. Josh S. Weston, Chairman Alexander S. Linchner, V. Chmn Rabbi Moshe Linchner, Dean Rabbi Ronald L. Gray, Exec VP    HERZOG-Chaim. We mourn the passing of our dear friend, Chaim Herzog, sixth President of the State of Israel, Ambassador to the United Nations, head of the Israeli Military Intelligence and General in the Israel Army, who not only lived through a historic period in world history-but helped to create it. As the son of Isaac Halevy Herzog, first Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi of the State of Israel, he received a thorough religious and secular education starting with the Hebron Yeshiva through the Wesley College in Dublin, the Government of Palestine Law School in Jerusalem and London and Cambridge Universities. Although he received many awards as co-author of more than six books, liberator of the victims of Nazi concentration camps while serving as officer in the British Armed Forces and honored by both branches of the U.S. Congress-In recent years he was most proud of the establishment of the Chaim Herzog Center for Middle East Studies & Diplomacy and the Ben Gurion University in the Negev-he served as a distinguished member on the Board of Directors of our Slim Fast Foods Companies for many years as a colleague of the greatest reliability, a loyal associate and an important factor in the success of a number of our business decisions. President Chaim Herzog brought a great sense of dignity and respect to the Jews throughout the world in general, and the citizens in Israel in particular because of his intellect, warmth, and his profound feeling of love and understanding for all members of the human race throughout the world. May the ''Almighty'' comfort his wife, Aura, his children and grandchildren among the bereaved people of Zion and Jerusalem and may his memory serve as a beacon of light to guide them all in the years ahead. S. Daniel Abraham, Chairman of the Board Dr. Edward L. Steinberg, Vice Chairman of the Board Slim Fast Foods Company    HERZOG-Chaim. Dearest Aura, we extend to you our deepest and most heartfelt condolences on the loss of your beloved Chaim. Our thoughts are with you and your family. We all mourn the loss of your beloved husband, a great leader and our dear friend. Through his devotion, commitment and courage, Chaim's life was perfect metaphor for the history of our people. His guidance and wisdom, always so pivotal to the growth and well being of our young nation, will be deeply missed. His brilliant legacy, however, will never fade. Chaim Herzog lives on in the hearts of all of us. May the Almighty comfort his family and the bereaved people of Zion and Jerusalem. American Friends Council for a Beautiful Israel    HERZOG-Chaim. United Jewish Appeal mourns the passing of Chaim Herzog: courageous soldier, Israel's brilliant and articulate Ambassador to the United Nations and sixth President, who served with dignity, strength and grace.

Moscovitz V.P., Chief Operating Officer    HERZOG-Chaim. The Anti-Defamation League mourns the passing of former Israeli President, Chaim Herzog.

May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. David H. Strassler National Chairman Abraham H. Foxman National Director    HERZOG-Honorable Chaim. Con gregation Kehilath Jeshurun mourns the passing of the illustrious past President of the State of Israel who was a cherished member and regular worshiper in our Synagogue during his days of brilliant service as Israel's Ambassador to the United Nations.

When a new season rolls around in a cultural capital like New York, already busy people are faced with an unpleasant reality: you can't see it all, so you have to pick and choose. But how? Well, who better to ask than people in the arts, many of whom know New York's cultural menu practically by heart? Here are their responses. ANITA GATES ANNE MEARA Acress and comedian    It's total nepotism. The things I choose to attend are the things my friends are in. PAUL RUDNICK, Playwright and screenwriter    I am hopeless arts-and-entertainment addict, so this fall I intend to see everything, with the following provisos:    1. I can't think of any activity, let alone an artwork, which should last eight hours and require a trip to Brooklyn.    2. In any medium, it is best to avoid trilogies, or anything which is proclaimed a \\"cycle.\\" Artists often declare that they will create a separate work for every decade of the century, every member of a fictional family or every color in a nation's flag. These are not promises of creative depth","excerpt":"they are threats.    3. Phrases to fear: dance/theater piece, performance piece and piece-in-progress. The word piece may actually b a synonym for \\"no air-conditioning\\" or \\"My folding chair is missing one rubber leg-tip.\\"    4. I will resist any theatrical presentation which does not involve speech but claims it is not mime. Dead giveaways:    \\"New Vaudeville,\\"    \\"Keatonesque,\\"    \\"balletic.\\" It's always mime.    5. In lyrics, let's declare a moratorium on the metaphorical use of the word \\"colors,\\" as in \\"The Colors of My Life\\" or \\"The Colors of the Wind.\\" The wind has no colors, unless there has been an explosion in a paint factory; your life has no color, unless you are standing near the factory. Only a ballad entitled \\"The Colors of My Hair\\" is acceptable. WENDY WASSERSTEIN Playwright    I see most plays. Other than that, I tend to go to the standbys that I go to every year. I'll always go to ABT. I'll always see \\"The Nutcracker.\\" I'll always get the City Ballet subscription for Thursday night, then call and ask to switch to Tuesday. ERIC STOLTZ Actor    I look for the play, film, exhibit or concert that has received the least amount of publicity and has no advertising budget. The less I know about something, the more likely I'll be open to being affected by it in some way, especially if my head isn't clouded with reviews and hype and word on the street. Of course, sometimes there is no avoiding the buzz (the current Hopper show, the coming revival of \\"Company,\\" the new David Hare, the new Scorsese film), so I try to see them the very first ay that I can. PATTI D'ARBANVILLE-QUINN Actress    Whatever is on the cutting edge, with the scissors. MARILYN HORNE Opera singer    I try to see the new things that are in town, but I can't tell you how many times I've bought tickets and had to give them away. Either I'm tired or I've been singing much too much or the weather's lousy, and I can't take the chance with my voice. I wanted to go to \\"Call Me Madam\\" with Tyne Daly, and the weather was just foul that night. I couldn't take the chance. ESTELLE PARSONS Actress    I like things that are going to be sort of new and different and give me a new perspective, and I do that more than I do Broadway or Off Broadway. I like Robert Wilson. I like Pina Bausch. I go to a lot of things from reviews; you an't help but be swayed by them. If I had my druthers, I'd go to everything. I think Sheldon Harnick gets to everything, actually. SHELDON HARNICK Lyricist    My wife and I pop up a lot of places, and people say I go to everything, but I don't. What I do see is a lot of theater. I do go to see Broadway plays; then there are the Off Broadway things that look interesting. And the plays that I miss I read. But if you mean the ballet and other things, I don't get to them. I love symphonic music, and I almost never get to go to a concert. We miss a great deal. There's just too much. PHYLLIS NEWMAN Actress    I get the paper and circle things that I'm really eager to see, then I put them on a list. And movies I go to whenever I have a minute. I use them like Prozac. MURRAY LOUIS Choreographer    I gore myself on all sorts of things. I will force myself to go to Lincoln Center. You can rest assured that you'll see quality there. Maybe not creativity, but quality. I go to Broadway to enjoy myslef. I'm a terrible plebeian in that way - singing the tunes, seeing a good hoofer. And I love Broadway at its mechanical best. I loved \\"Sunset Boulevare\\"! If there was something going on that I couldn't stand, there was always something else I could focus on - a wonderful chair, the staircase. And I loved seeing Glenn Close in that white fur costume. It was hideous, but I loved the audacity of it. BOBBY SHORT Musician    I'd love to see everything, but there just isn't time. This year there's an evening with Paul Bowles that I want to get to, and a big celebration at the Public Theater that I'm angling for. But i've gwoen accustomed to missing things. I missed Robert Wilson because I couldn't get a ticket. KITTY CARLISLE HART Chairman, New York State Council on the Arts    I try to go to events where I feel that my being there can do the organization some good.I missed Robert Wilson this year, but he didn't need me; he had most of the glitterati of New York at his performances. And I'll try to catch him next time. PAUL TAYLOR Choreographer    All I see are the professionally related things that I'm obligated to see. I don't even go see my own work in New York. Once they go into dress rehearsals, I make a beeline to my house in the country. PAUL BARTEL Director    I'm a subscriber to both Playwrights Horizons and the Manhattan Theater Club. But the thing that I most look forward to is the New York Film Festival, where I get to see the things I didn't see if I didn't make it to Cannes. JAC VENZA Executive producer, \\"Great Performances\\"    I tend to look at the talent in the production rather than the production itself. I also tend to look at producing organizations. And I have to have my radar out for people I've never heard of before and keep track of them. CHARLES BUSCH Actor and drag queen    Whatever I can a free ticket to. But when I do pay, I pay top dollar. Usually once a season there's one play I feel I should see for educationsl purposes: Vanessa Redgrave in \\"Orpheus Descending,\\" Maggie Smith in \\"Lettice and Lovage,\\" Kathleen Turner in \\"Indescretions.\\" The only thing I'll pay top dollar for this year is Zoe Caldwell in \\"Master Class.\\" Otherwise it's comp, comp, comp.

This fall, the list of restaurants to open is almost as brief as that of Democratic Presidential candidates. But where kitchens are being built, and menus conceived, there is optimism.   \\"I think I know what it takes,\\" said Arnold Israel, a former advertising and promotional executive who is opening his first restaurant, a refurbished edition of the Art Deco One Fifth at Fifth Avenue and Washington Square in about a month. Paradoxically, the recession made it easier for him to open the restaurant now than during the boom years of the past decade because his initial investment was considerably less than it would have been then and it was easier to negotiate favorable terms for the space.   \\"The economics are good now but you still have to be prepared to work 16 hours a day to cater to your customers,\\" he said last week. \\"By giving people excellent food, service and value you can sustain it beyond the initial flush of curiosity.\\"   A sound philosophy does not guarantee success, of course, but now that much of the glamour in the New York restaurant business is gone, this year's crop of intrepid restaurateurs will try to follow the lead of establishments that are weathering the recession and transition from the free-spending 80's to the cautious 90's.   In New York and around the country, these perennial magnets continue to fill their tables night after night. In contrast to the hot spots that briefly attracted a feeding frenzy of fashionable crowds before closing down, these durable restaurants have in common a businesslike attitude of dedicated professionalism.   \\"Successful restaurants like the Gotham Bar and Grill are about fabulous consistency and constantly paying attention to detail,\\" said Richard Lavin, who is working with Mr. Israel as a consultant. \\"We think we're all headed for Broadway, but we must be willing to edit all the time.\\"   Like the Gotham Bar and Grill, there are other places known for top-notch food in relaxed but stylish settings that were established in the early 1980's and are still going strong. Union Square Cafe, Elio's and Provence are some notable examples. Some restaurants, ranging from formally elegant to brassy, like Le Cirque and Jim McMullen's on the Upper East Side, Cafe des Artistes on the West Side and Smith & Wollensky and the venerable Palm in midtown, have been enjoying even longer successful runs. Commander's Palace in New Orleans, Legal Seafood in Boston and Joe's Stone Crab in Miami are all examples of restaurants in other cities around the country that continue to succeed regardless of the economy.   A casual neighborhood spot like Isabella's, with its sidewalk cafe on the Upper West Side, which opened in late 1987, never enjoyed the high profile of some others but has become solidly established. Stephen Hanson, one of the owners, said that to date, business in 1991 is outpacing that in 1990 by about 6 percent.   A few newer places at various price levels, including Aureole, Trattoria dell'Arte and Zarela, have been around long enough for the novelty to have worn off, but are still packed with diners night after night.   \\"Business is up by 20 percent,\\" said Sheldon Fireman, the owner of Trattoria dell'Arte. \\"There's no magic, it's all hard work and having a flexible attitude that doesn't dictate to the customers but keeps them happy and coming back.\\"   And judging from the many customers who dine there week after week, Coco Pazzo, the busy Italian spot on the Upper East Side that is scarcely a year old, appears to fit the profile of a place settling in for a long run rather than one doomed to become a fashion victim. \\"People come in here, look around and asked, 'What recession?' \\" said John Fanning, the maitre d'hotel.   The key, of course, is nurturing repeat business. Successful restaurateurs say their regular customers make up anywhere from 40 to 90 percent of their business, which may explain why neighborhood restaurants that depend on a local clientele seem to be thriving. Eddie Schoenfeld, an owner of Vince and Eddie's near Lincoln Center, is opening another restaurant on the West Side in September, Fishin Eddie on West 71st Street.   \\"We hope we can continue to satisfy the needs of this neighborhood,\\" he said. \\"It's very important to understand your marketplace.\\"   It's not only the neighborhood places that hope to cultivate a local clientele. \\"We do not want to be that once-a-year special occasion sort of place,\\" Peter W. Tischmann, vice president and general manager of the newly restored St. Regis, said of the hotel's luxuriously appointed restaurant, Lespinasse. \\"We want to be the kind of place people will come back to because they like the food and the service and because they can afford it.\\"   \\"Having repeat customers makes a place recession proof,\\" Mr. Tischmann said, \\"but to do that we must first establish ourselves.\\" Lespinasse will open Sept. 10 with Gray Kunz, formerly of Adrienne in the Peninsula across the street, as chef.   Mr. Tischmann said a three-course lunch would cost $35, comparable to many of the top midtown restaurants. But the price of a three-course dinner, including extras like chocolates and petits fours, will be $50, $5 to $20 less than most of the competition.   But delivering value is not just about low prices. In the past few years a number of Manhattan restaurants like Hubert's and Rakel restructured their menus and cut prices but still went out of business. \\"New Yorkers are sophisticated and they understand about prices,\\" said Sirio Maccioni, the owner of Le Cirque.   \\"It goes back to perceived value and that can happen at any price level,\\" said Drew Nieporent, owner of Montrachet and an owner of TriBeCa Grill. Mr. Nieporent says that TriBeCa is extremely busy, and that Montrachet has \\"hung in there.\\"   \\"Your customers have to buy what you're delivering,\\" he said. \\"And it's not just the food. For some it's the room or the service or the greeting at the door. Maybe they really like just one dish.\\"   Indeed, there is a host of elements that contribute to a restaurant's success. And unlike in the flush economic climate a few years ago when droves of people would show up at the latest multimillion-dollar cattle barn with sponged walls, halogen sconces and $25 grilled chicken, close attention must be paid to every one of them.   Mr. Hanson said that when he opened Coconut Grove, his first restaurant, in early 1987, it was meant to be trendy. \\"It was less well-conceived and that wasn't wise because trends pass,\\" he said. \\"By the time I opened Isabella's I had a better understanding of how important it was to attract people from the community. You have to work much harder at service.\\" Unlike Isabella's, Mr. Hanson said, business at Coconut Grove is off about 8 percent.   \\"Customers are much more demanding these days","excerpt":"they are very aware of prices and are very sensitive to the details on how they are treated -- on the phone, when they come in, by the waiter, everything,\\" said Elio Guaitolini, co-owner of Elio's, which opened at Second Avenue and 84th Street in 1981 and where some customers dine as often as two or three times a week. \\"We have to be much more careful than we were three years ago when the mood was lighter,\\" he said.   Marc Sarrazin, who runs an informal personnel agency for chefs in addition to being an owner of DeBragga & Spitler, wholesale meat purveyors to the restaurant industry, believes it is important for restaurants to deliver according to expectations. \\"There is room for great restaurants at every level, but there has to be harmony,\\" he said. \\"Customers can sense when there is tension, when the kitchen and dining room are at odds. We should give them more credit.\\"   Pretension is out and personalization is in. Even at Le Cirque, where the social and power scene makes it seem as if the 80's never went away, Mr. Maccioni can be seen patrolling the dining room with an eagle eye; he's not above aligning the salt and pepper shakers or instructing a waiter to remove plates.    Mr. Maccioni and others also pointed out how important it was to refresh a restaurant. At the Gotham Bar and Grill, for example, Jerome Kretchmer, an owner, and his chef, Alfred Portale, are developing a complete four- or five-course dinner for the first time. \\"It's just to give our steady customers the possibility of a new experience,\\" Mr. Kretchmer said.   Charles Palmer, chef and co-owner of Aureole, said nothing can be taken for granted. \\"Business has been great, but if there is any lapse it could go the other way. This place is not cheap but I guess people perceive it as value.\\" The complete dinner at Aureole is $55.   And just as chefs and owners are paying careful attention to the details of greeting and service as well as to the quality of food, they are forever fine-tuning costs so they do not have to increase prices in the face of higher expenses. \\"We no longer have the guys from Wall Street coming in and showing off with $400 bottles of port,\\" Mr. Palmer said.   These former big spenders, it seems, are also going to bed earlier these days. Fashionably late no longer seems fashionable and many restaurants, even the highly successful ones, are trying to devise ways, like not closing for vacation, to compensate for the decline in business after 9:30 or 10 P.M. It's a situation the newcomers will have to face. These hours around the edges of the prime dining times can often make the difference between profit and loss.   Along with the high-rolling party atmosphere, out went the dilettantes who regarded having a stake in a restaurant as a way of nourishing their egos but who never wanted to do the hard work.   \\"When you think of the great restaurants of Europe, they're about the people who run them, not two-or-three-million-dollar installations,\\" Mr. Sarrazin said. \\"In the past few years the restaurant business became distorted, a monster. Maybe now it's getting back on a better track.\\" Taking Lessons From Restaurants That Still Fill Their Seats"},{"year":"1974","title":"New York met Moscow in basketball last night, and the coach of the Soviet team, Yuri Burakov, summed up the game accurately.

Take the widespread notion that young instrumental virtuosos these days, while technically proficient, are bland, conservative and utterly lacking in individuality, ''soul'' or ''heart.''   This is an assumption with a curious combination of proponents, uneasily allied. Older music teachers believe it, out of nostalgia for their own youth (although naturally they carefully exempt their own best students from the general stigma). Record collectors and scholars with an interest in Romantic performance practice believe it, clinging to their scratchy old disks. Lots of knowledgeable concertgoers and music-business professionals, dispirited from the general round of mechanically executed, calculatedly careerist concerts they encounter, believe it. Even some contemporary-music specialists, those who regret the seemingly broken bonds between living music and present-day performers, believe it, arguing that young performers today are spiritually dead because of their lack of contact with their own time.   But what if this widely held thesis isn't valid?

But this, like the film's humor, is flashed only intermittently in this somewhat disjointed account of the continuing clashes between the tough padre and equally rugged Communist Mayor of an Italian village. The principals appear to be tiring. They are not nearly as fresh and explosive as they once were.Since an observer cannot avoid comparisons in dealing with a sequel, it should be noted that Julien Duvivier—he again helped adapt and directed from Giovanni Guareschi's lively book — has drawn unusual characterizations from an Italian-speaking, Franco-Italian cast. And, in shooting his comedy-drama in authentic settings, he has captured beautiful footage in both mountainous territory and a hamlet on the banks of a river that turns into a raging torrent.Unfortunately, however, a moviegoer who has not been exposed to either the stories or the previous film might find this new series of tussles slightly puzzling. Despite a profusion of literal English subtitles, \\"The Return of Don Camillo\\" lacks cohesion. Some incidents are merely more memorable than others.Although it does take up where the first film left off, with the saddened Don Camillo en route to a new parish, there is no doubt in a viewer's mind that the padre will soon be back in his beloved Brescello and in constant strife with Peppone, the Mayor, and his hot-headed proletarians. That the struggle between the priest and Mayor is ideological and not fatal is at once evident.Although he is plagued unmercifully, our priest, a genuinely compassoniate man, helps the Mayor with that official's strangely recalcitrant son. The embattled pair confuse the villagers with the clocks on the church and town hall","excerpt":"they argue with the rich landowner for acreage on which to erect a dike, and they are vicious in taunting each other on religious and political issues.But when the chips are down they are a team. In an effective, climactic scene, the priest, celebrating mass in his empty water-filled church as his fleeing parishioners listen on high ground near-by, is saved by the Mayor when the bell crashes from its tower. Our cleric is still cute when he regains consciousness in the Mayor's arms. \\"Forgive me,\\" he says, \\"for thinking I was in paradise.\\"As the priest, Fernandel again proves he is one of the world's major comics. He is amusing and genuinely appealing and sincere as the pastor who thinks nothing of talking aloud to his God, of belting a pugilist who is about to annihilate the Mayor and of skipping stones over a stream with a young boy.As the heavy-set, belligerent Mayor, Gino Cervi, is superficially hard and muscular. Affection for his adversary rises above his political differences with the pastor. Alexandre Rignault and Claudy Chapeland, as his somewhat yokelish sidekick, and Eduard Delmont, as a wise old doctor, stand out among the villagers.Politics, as we were saying, actually plays second fiddle to simple and abiding friendships in \\"The Return of Don Camillo.\\" But the parts of this folk tale are greater than the whole.

By Brent C. Brolin. Illustrated. 338 pp. New York: St. Martin's Press. $30. BRENT C. BROLIN writes that ''Flight of   Fancy'' is intended ''to understand why ornament, which had been an integral part of life for millenia, should have virtually disappeared at the beginning of this century.'' The explanation offered by Mr. Brolin, an architect and writer, is that the newly emergent European middle class of the 18th and 19th centuries, unlike the aristocratic patrons of the arts before, brought a largely uneducated taste to the marketplace its buying power created. Because of its penchant for decorative excess, however, the middle class alienated artisans from ornamentation. Starting with the English architect A. W. N. Pugin in the early 19th century, reformers tried to elevate middle-class taste levels by setting esthetics on a moral basis","excerpt":"they argued in favor of honesty of materials, function and structure.

All the essays in ''Notes of an Anatomist'' are colored to a greater or lesser degree by his professional experience, and in one of them, ''The Dead as a Living,'' he wonders openly what effect years of performing autopsies can have had on his personality. Pathologists deal with morbid conditions","excerpt":"they become habituated to cutting open and cutting up.

The essay, and perhaps the whole collection, could also have been entitled ''A Pathologist's Apology'' - for Dr. Gonzalez-Crussi goes on to insist that pathology has its ''ennobling and even poetic qualities.'' While almost everyone else reduces the dead to an abstraction, it is the pathologist's distinction to be concerned with them for their own sake, as human beings who are still maintaining an individual existence - until, that is, his job is done, at which point they cease to be human and no longer interest him.

So moviegoers ate up Mr. Serpico's no-good-deed-goes-unpunished story in which he learns about widespread police corruption, reports it and soon finds himself in danger, turned upon by his fellow officers. The film, directed by Sidney Lumet, still stands up as drama and as an intriguing example of early Pacino style. Mr. Pacino won a best-actor Golden Globe for the role.    PAULINE AND PAULETTE (2001)  Sunday at 12:45 and 6:30 p.m. and Monday at 5 p.m. on IFC  Once upon a time there were four elderly Belgian sisters. One of them, Pauline (Dora van der Groen, below right), was mentally retarded. Another, Martha (Julienne De Bruyn), took care of her. But when Martha died, neither Cécile (Rosemarie Bergmans) nor Paulette (Ann Petersen, below left) wanted the responsibility. The catch was that if one of them didn't take on the job, they wouldn't inherit any of Martha's money. This was unfortunate, because Pauline didn't fit in with Cécile's decorating scheme. When the film opened in New York in 2002, A.O. Scott, writing in The New York Times, called it ''subtle, poignant'' and a ''refreshing contrast'' to Hollywood melodramas about mental disability. Lieven Debrauwer directed.    THE HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY (2005)  Saturday at 9 p.m. on Starz  Arthur Dent (Martin Freeman) thinks he has troubles, just because his house is scheduled for demolition. But he soon learns from his pal Ford Prefect (Mos Def) that the planet is scheduled for demolition too. (Dolphins were trying to tell us, but we weren't listening.) Just before Earth blows up, the two men escape by catching a ride on a spaceship. And they're off on their adventures. Sam Rockwell (above right, with Mr. Freeman, center, and Mos Def) lets his ego run wild as Zaphod Beeblebrox, the flamboyant president of the galaxy. And Arthur even runs into a pretty girl (Zooey Deschanel) he met at a party back home. Garth Jennings directed this lovably goofy adaptation of Douglas Adams's book.    THE LIVING END (1992)  Monday at midnight on Sundance  Nothing left to lose is just another word for freedom in Gregg Araki's comic drama about two young, gay, H.I.V.-positive men.

Sometimes the crime being committed in the name of cinema seemed outrageous enough to justify such a response, but I restrained myself.It is because I have a deeply rooted respect and love for filmmakers that booing has never been a part of my film vocabulary, that is, until I saw Dusan Makavejev's film, \\"WR-Mysteries of the Organism.\\" Booing was plainly not the proper thing to do at the somewhat austere critic's screening at the Vivian Beaumont, especially since Makavejev was expected to appear momentarily for a press conference. But it was, it seemed to me, a proper response for a film that in the name of freedom, joy and the \\"avant garde,\\" exploited, misinterpreted and maligned the very man's work that it professed to hold dear. Unfortunately, the deception of the film is masked so slyly and subtly that its insidiousness is not easily apparent. And it was this that outraged me.Before going further, a brief description of the film might be helpful. Dusan Makavejev came to America a few years ago from Yugoslavia, with the alleged purpose of making a film about Wilhelm Reich, the controversial psychiatrist who died in 1957. Makavejev interviewed relatives of Reich, doctors who currently use his methods of therapy, and various people who he thought represented aspects of the sexual changes taking place in America. Edited into this is a political comedy located in Yugoslavia, based on a girl who, we are led to believe, is a follower and admirer of Reich's views and sees his theories as helpful to the growth of Yugoslavian Communism. (It should be noted quickly however, that the girl's understanding of Reich is so simplistic and distorted that she hardly represents what Reich believed at all, although the director would like us to think so.)For a final touch, there is footage of an old Russian film on Stalin plus assorted other film tidbits, all rather freely (but not without conscious design) edited together. Unfortunately, the intent of the editing is not to make the connection between these disparate scenes clearer but, more often than not, to obscure and often misrepresent what is really going on.It is here that the problem of the film comes into focus. For under the guise of artistic license, Makavejev takes bits of reality and truth and distorts them through the use of editing tricks, subliminal visual associations and Reich's own words used out of the context and spirit in which they were written. Such techniques of character assassination and audience manipulation are not new in film, but rarely have they been used in such a devious way.Take, for example, this use of editing. We are shown a scene of a conscious man actually being given shock treatment in a hospital. A piece of cloth is jammed in his mouth and the electric shock administered. His body writhes in pain and involuntary muscle contractions. It is a pathetic sight, Makavejev cuts from this scene of almost utter horror to a Reichian therapy workshop where people are screaming and going through strange body movements. The distinct impression caused by this scene, especially when immediately preceded by the shock therapy sequence, is that these patients are undergoing a similar experience. Although it is hard to know exactly what Makavejev meant by juxtaposing these two scenes, their effect is to present a ludicrous and negative picture of Reichian therapy.Makavejev does not bother to explain that the screaming and yelling in the workshop are a therapeutic means of getting in touch with one's anger and negativity by direct vocal expression. He does not bother to explain that the strange body movements are very specific positions used to break down tension blocks (or armor, as Reich described it) in the body so that good feelings can flow more easily.So while Makavejev, on the surface, seems to be praising Reich, the actual content of the film mocks and maligns him. Makavejev then cloaks these distortions in a web of comedy and \\"avant garde\\" ambiguity. It is an old trick. Hide the poison in sugar. And Makavejev's film is just that. He gives us so much sugar (off-beat poet Tuli Kupferberg, transvestite Jackie Curtis, sex scenes, music, comedy, plus political pokes at the United States and Russia) that our senses get clouded and we forget, indeed can hardly decipher what the film is about. We think it must be about Reich since he is quoted, talked about and seen so much. But in point of fact, the film bears as much resemblance to Reich and his work as Coke does to \\"the real thing\\" or Pepsi to Living and Giving (You've got a lot to Live and Pepsi's got a lot to Give).Some people prefer to stop at this point and ask why Reich should even be discussed in an appraisal of the film. Can't the film be judged on esthetic grounds alone?To bring the issue closer to the hearts of most film lovers, let me offer this analogy. Imagine that 30 years from now François Truffaut has become a relatively obscure film director. A film is made titled, \\"FT-Mysteries of the Cinematic Process.\\" We are led to believe that the film will be a sympathetic re-discovery of Truffaut's work. The film consists in good part of scenes from Hitchcock, Renoir and Truffaut films, showing the influence of these masters on his filmmaking. But instead of explaining that part of Truffaut's esthetic was a continual homage to these filmmakers, the film deviously presents Truffaut as just a rank imitator.By not explaining Truffaut's own esthetic accurately, by taking scenes out of context, or juxtaposing them so as to downgrade him, the film totally misrepresents Truffaut. I wonder how many film lovers would elect to dismiss any comparison with the real Truffaut as being unimportant to the meaning and critical appraisal of the hypothetical film I have outlined. Yet it is this type of cinematic logic that I have found quite prevalent when Makavejev's film is discussed.In order to determine if my own feelings were true that Makavejev had misrepresented not only Reich's views but those of the Bioenergetic doctors depicted in the film, I spoke to Drs. John Pierrakos and Alexander Lowen","excerpt":"they brought up many objections to Makavejev's use of Reich. But foremost was Makavejev's misinterpretation, and therefore distortion, of Reich's views on sexuality.\\"Reich believed, and in all his writings stressed, that sexuality should be based on feelings of love,\\" Dr. Pierrakos said. \\"But Makavejev makes no distinction between healthy sexuality and libertinism. Ho disassociates sex from love. Almost all of Makavejev's references to sex in the film show it as either a mechanical act, masturbatory or perverse. By leaving the feelings of love out of sexuality, Makavejev distorts Reich's views. Mr. Makavejev is entitled to disagree with Reich, but he is not entitled to put his views in the mouth of Reich or to identify them with our work in Bioenergetics.\\"The question inevitably arises — if the film is not about Reich, or is a conscious misrepresentation of Reich, what is it really about? I submit that instead of being a tribute to Reich, \\"WR-Mysteries of the Organism\\" is little more than a putdown of practically everything it touches. It uses Reich as a device, to show the repressive nature of the United States government, and to show what unbridled sexual \\"freedom\\" might lead to. There is hardly a scene shot in America which does not seek to focus on either the bizarre or perverse, except those scenes which mock, in one way or another, Reich.By the association of Reich's theories with these scenes of current-day America, Makevejev implies that the two are connected. And as for Russia, Stalin is given his due in scenes which epitomize his stiffness and inhumanity.By contrast, the only joyful place is an apartment in Yugoslavia where two beautiful girls romp around, proclaim a sexual revolution (which has much to do with sex; but little with love) and generally make merry. These scenes are usually comic and lighthearted — especially when juxtaposed with the perversity in America and the authoritarianism of Russia. The two superpowers have gone astray, each in its own way.This seems to be the message of Makavejev's film and no doubt there is truth in it. But I question if, in the name of freedom and fun, Makavejev has not grossly misused his directorial powers. If a film is pure fiction, then all praise to the director who lets his imagination run rampant. But when the actual lives of people, both living and dead, are represented in a quasi-documentary which is supposed to be \\"about them,\\" the test of reality and truth must also enter into an understanding and appraisal of the film.The film certainly fails this test and, unfortunately for Makavejev, \\"WR-Mysteries of the Organism\\" fails also as comedy and satire. For any film based on an essentially dishonest approach toward its subject must eventually go sour. It is no wonder then that the film, which begins by proclaiming that life should be joyful, turns out to be one of the gloomiest of recent memory.

Too breathless to scold she spent her rage in rolling the helpless body hither and thither, holding both wrists in one firm grasp, and stuffing eyes ears nose and mouth with the feathery seeds of the grass ... For the next two seconds they rolled indiscriminately in a bundle, imparting handfuls of grass together with gestures which under other conditions might have been described as kisses.''   But when ''The Voyage Out'' was published in 1915, the final version of the scene was quite different, both in its language and in the addition of Terence, Rachel's fiance. It now read: ''Helen was upon her. Rolled this way and that, now seeing only forests of green, and now the high blue heaven, she was speechless and almost without sense.

Harcourt Brace Jovanovich. $24.95.   In his new book, \\"Words With Power,\\" the distinguished literary theorist Northrop Frye examines the role of myth and metaphor in the Bible, showing how many of its central themes and images reverberate throughout Western literature. His conclusion is that \\"the organizing structures of the Bible and the corresponding structures of 'secular' literature reflect each other,\\" that a finite number of species of myths (including myths of creation, fall, exodus, destruction and redemption) provide the narrative sources of literature.    Such ideas, of course, have been suggested by Mr. Frye before -- most notably in his famous 1957 study, \\"Anatomy of Criticism.\\" In fact, \\"Words With Power\\" serves as both a sequel to his earlier study of the Bible and literature, \\"The Great Code: The Bible and Literature\\" (1982), and as a summing up and restatement of his overall critical views. As a result, some of this book (particularly its theoretical first half, which deals with different idioms of linguistic expression and the social function of literature) feels turgid and overly pedantic, as though Mr. Frye were simply reworking earlier assertions, while trying to answer questions raised by other critics.      It is the second part of the book, which actually deals with specific myths and archetypes found in the Bible (and their reinvention in modern Western literature), that will be most accessible to the nonspecialized public that Mr. Frye says he hopes to reach. Clearly the reader may question his methodology in this section: Mr. Frye's choice of examples is highly selective, sometimes even random, and his discussions of individual works can feel similarly arbitrary. In addition, many of his observations relating biblical stories to classical and primitive myths will be familiar to readers of Robert Graves's \\"White Goddess,\\" James George Frazer's \\"Golden Bough\\" and Joseph Campbell's studies of mythology.   Still, this portion of \\"Words With Power\\" intermittently makes for lively and provocative reading. Drawing on his vast reading, Mr. Frye helps the reader recognize some of the recurring myths that connect religious and secular literature, and he shows how ideological and social changes can cause changes in the interpretation and emphasis of those myths. While early hard-line Christians regarded parallel classical myths as \\"demonic parodies of the true biblical ones,\\" he adds that later, more liberal Christians came to regard classical mythology as a kind of \\"supplement or counterpoint to the Christian one.\\"      As Mr. Frye sees it, the idea of the axis mundi -- the vertical line postulated by the ancients as running through the cosmos, connecting heaven to earth and earth to hell -- underlies many of Western literature's central myths, providing writers with a wealth of metaphors and images. Those images, he notes, tend to fall into two categories: ascent and descent. Images of ascent, which symbolize man's longing for heavenly perfection, include Jacob's ladder, the purgatorial mountain in Dante's \\"Divine Comedy,\\" the turning staircase in T. S. Eliot's \\"Ash Wednesday\\" and the towers and spirals that recur in Yeats's poetry.    The reverse movement -- downward into death or damnation -- has yielded equally powerful images. Christ's descent to earth echoes Adam's fall from innocence, while Adam's expulsion from the garden is mirrored by the exile of Cain. Whereas Mr. Frye sees downward movements in Dante and Milton as \\"simply descents to death and hell,\\" he argues that they can take on more creative aspects in other writers's work.   Proserpine's descent every winter into the nether world is a necessary prelude to her ascent in the spring -- and the earth's renewed fertility. Prometheus is punished by Zeus for bringing fire down from heaven but is heralded as the liberator of mankind. Ahab descends into madness as he searches for the great white whale but in doing so becomes a symbol of man's eternal quest for wisdom.      For Mr. Frye, the lower depths represent not only death or hell","excerpt":"they can also stand for \\"whatever in human nature is subordinated in the traditional structures.\\" In Freud, this comes to signify the unconscious promptings of the id; in Marx, the energetic strivings of the proletariat. For such revolutionary thinkers, Mr. Frye says, \\"the initiative comes from below\\" and \\"the response to it is normally a journey of exploration downward.\\"    In the course of \\"Words With Power,\\" Mr. Frye also discusses other recurrent literary themes, like the wheel of fortune (which brings together images of ascent and descent into an endless cycle), the \\"purgatorial vision\\" of Exodus (a three-part narrative that moves from the bondage in Egypt to the wandering in the wilderness to the entry into the Promised Land), the Virgin Birth and the Garden of Eden.    His discussions of these themes, like the ones noted above, tend to be discursive, peremptory and quite often reductive. Darwin, Schopenhauer, Kierkegaard as well as Marx and Freud are dealt with in a couple paragraphs, and Blake's idiosyncratic mythology (once the subject of an entire book by Mr. Frye) is summarized in several pages. As a result, the reader finishes this volume hungry for more details and deeper analysis. Indeed, one can only surmise that that was one of Mr. Frye's objectives in writing \\"Words With Power\\" -- to send the reader back to other books, to other volumes of criticism, as well as to the Bible and other works of literature.

A DAY THAT LASTED A YEAR AT MARULANDA"},{"year":"1995","title":"FOR a nation sharply divided about how to save rare species like the spotted owl, the California gnatcatcher and the Florida panther, the idea of ecosystem management seemed just the thing. Rather than letting the life or death of a single species determine the fate of proposed dams and timber projects, this new philosophy of land management was designed to protect broad natural habitats, including the species within them, while still leaving room for humans to exploit the land. Ecosystems, unlike species on the brink of extinction, are elastic enough to take some abuse by humans","excerpt":"they can be preserved without getting in the way of progress. So, in this era of public ambivalence about nature's neediest cases, the idea of ecosystem management seemed to have a bright political future. It offered something for everyone -- liberals and conservatives, conservationists and industrialists.    Over the last two years, the Clinton Administration has embraced the concept of ecosystem management. In 1993 the Interior Department set up the National Biological Survey, a group of 1,700 scientists and natural resource specialists, charged with the task of making this concept work.     The survey had scarcely begun when the Republicans came to town. The problem then became how to sell the Republicans on an environmental novelty that nobody could easily explain. Now that problem looks more intractable than ever.    An ecosystem is an area -- usually a distinct landscape like Appalachia or a watershed like the Chesapeake Bay -- in which plant and animal communities live in complex relationships with one other and with the region's soil, water, air and climate. The trouble is, ecosystems, like cuisines, are inherently hard to define. \\"To some degree, an ecosystem is in the eye of the beholder,\\" Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt once testified in Congress.     Ecosystem management is even harder to define. It's a slippery concept, calling for extraordinary cooperation among various uncoordinated bureaucracies and competing interest groups. A Congressional Research Service report on ecosystem management stated drily that \\"there is not enough agreement on the meaning of the concept to hinder its popularity.\\"    Apparently, though, there is enough agreement to kill the concept altogether. When the Republicans swept in, they quickly began devising a budgetary death for ecosystem management.    This month, at the first budget hearing called by the new Republican majority on the House Appropriations Committee's subcommittee dealing with natural resource issues, star witnesses from conservative think tanks (including the conservative Heritage Foundation, the libertarian Cato Institute and the pro-business Citizens for a Sound Economy) advised the House to abolish the National Biological Survey, whose very existence was never explicitly authorized by Congress.     Already the biological survey is under assault. The House Republicans' \\"contract\\" of high priority legislation envisions practically eliminating the scientific budget of the Interior Department -- a cutback that the new Republican chairman of the House Budget Committee, John R. Kasich of Ohio, wholeheartedly favors.     But even while the National Biological Survey is threatened, the Clinton Administration's senior environmental officials are trying to save it. Their first small step in its defense was to rename the scientific agency the National Biological Service, which they hope will sound more appealing. Ultimately, they want to persuade lawmakers that ecosystem management is not a radical concept but an idea that all ideologies can embrace.    \\"This approach, whether you call it ecosystem management or not, is the most significant contribution that this Administration has made to environmental policy,\\" said George Frampton, the assistant secretary of Interior. \\"Trying to involve as many stakeholders as possible in our decisions, trying to meld good science with practical solutions, those are all things that the Republican center of power in Congress ought to support, even more than liberal Democrats.\\"    Three recent examples show what ecosystem management has accomplished under the Clinton Administration:    *A Federal judge in Seattle has approved the Administration's plan for the old-growth forests of the Pacific Northwest. The plan allows for logging to resume at a low enough level that it does not disturb the endangered spotted owl's habitat or the streams that shelter salmon and hundreds of other species.    *The State of California has reached an agreement with Federal water and wildlife agencies for managing the San Francisco Bay and its neighboring tributaries and deltas. According to that agreement, water would be allocated to agricultural and urban users in such a way that the spawning grounds of local fish would be protected.    *In southern Florida, the Corps of Engineers has begun planning for the rehabilitation of the Everglades, an unfathomably complex ecosystem that in the past 50 years humans have altered almost beyond recognition.    Still, the prospect for ecosystem management looks grim. Ecosystem management works best when artificial boundaries like state lines or property fences or bureaucratic turf do not matter. But in a world where boundaries do matter, the idea of ecosystem management, like the Endangered Species Act itself, collides again and again with the interests of private property owners -- and that is exactly what has bothered the conservatives about environmentalism all along.

The kind used depends on the type of fire involved. Water extinguishers are used to fight Class A fires, which involve wood, paper, cloth or other combustible materials. Mr. Summerline said water extinguishers should never be used on fires involving electrical equipment. Liquefied gas extinguishers are the most widely used because they leave no water or powder as do other extinguishers, Mr. Summerline said.

But to blame racism for theater owners' reluctance to show \\"New Jack City\\" -- and some whites' qualms about seeing it -- seems intellectually dishonest.   Mario Van Peebles says it's not the content of his movie that provoked a riot, but the fact that there weren't enough seats for everyone who wanted to see it. (Or perhaps because they had seen a video of the Los Angeles police beating incident). Well, I've been to a lot of sold-out movies that didn't produce bloodshed. Is there something different about \\"New Jack City\\"?   The answer is the movie's content.  The Van Peebles film deals with neglected subjects: drugs, street life, problems of black urban America. Not surprisingly, it attracts people for whom the movie is particularly relevant -- not    only    those, but certainly those. In other words, there are some people who see \\"New Jack City\\" for whom violence is a part of everyday life. These are not people who see \\"The Little Mermaid.\\" (And, as Melvin Van Peebles points out, tough crowds don't have to be black","excerpt":"they can be white soccer fans or concertgoers as well). If theater owners are uncomfortable with a potentially violent audience, it doesn't make them racist, just cautious. Who wants a multimillion-dollar lawsuit from an injured patron?   Mario Van Peebles also argues that theater owners and moviegoers shouldn't object to the participatory style in which some blacks see movies. Instead, they should \\"get hip\\" to it. Why? If someone wants to see a movie without interruptions from the audience, he or she should be able to. That doesn't make the white moviegoer who stays away from \\"New Jack City\\" for this reason racist. Some people don't think audience participation improves the experience of watching a movie.   Why does all this matter? Because there's enough racism in American life without seeing it where it doesn't exist. Would it be so awful for Mario Van Peebles to come out and say, \\"Sure, there are some tough crowds at my movie. That's because my movie is realistic and they can relate to it.

If plants are growing in a sterile non-soil potting mix, as mine are, shouldn't they have some fertilizer now, even though I read that this is a dormant period? Dr. P.M., Arlington, Va.     A. Applications of fertilizer at this time of year depend greatly on two things: the kind of plant and its exposure. There are no nutrients in the soilless mixes and supplemental fertilizer is necessary during the plants' active growing periods. However, if the plants are not growing actively, and the roots are not absorbing the fertilizer, salts can accumulate no matter what the growing medium. This is a difficult question to answer as so much depends on the above factors. If the plants appear to be vital, then applications of fertilizer should not be necessary now. If the plants lag in color and vigor, applications of water-soluble fertilizer at a reduced rate would be helpful. But caution on any overfeeding at this time of year. Egg Shells/Soil    Q.

The governorship of New York will cost the winner about $10 million and the losers another $10 million. Electing the entire House of Representatives cost more than $300 million in 1992, and 60 of the winners spent more than $1 million each. Much of this money can be fairly called a bribe -- it is laboriously gathered from corporations and individuals seeking favors from Government. No more desirably, some of it comes from the personal fortunes of candidates. Most of the money goes to buy television commercials that are often misleading and even mendacious. Charges of drug dealing, tax cheating and criminal coddling crowd the screen, with not even a pretense of proof.    Television, in other words, has simultaneously corrupted and debased the American political system.    That stark sentiment is widely acknowledged even by the compromised members of Congress. But the search for remedies has been frustrated by their diverse self-interests.  And, alas, too few of the remedies address the central problem: the high cost and low quality of TV ads.    True reform -- a revolution really -- would force the candidates to forgo commercials in return for free television time, in segments long enough to make them debate their issues and qualifications. Considering the failure of lesser reforms, it's a fantasy worth pursuing.   THE PRESENT SCANDAL HAS two dimensions. By surrendering enormous influence to organized donors -- the political action committees of bankers or physicians or environmentalists -- the system distorts and blocks legislation in every field. And by filling the campaign chests of incumbents, the committees enfeeble all challengers except millionaires who can subsidize themselves. The PAC's don't just pursue their own little loopholes and benefits. They join with like-minded others to acquire the force of what the former Senator Warren Rudman of New Hampshire has called \\"wolf packs.\\"    Moreover, the influence of PAC's extends beyond a single vote. As the former Senator William Proxmire of Wisconsin has said: \\"It may come in a speech not delivered . . . in a colleague not influenced. It may come in a calling off of a meeting . . . in a minor change in one paragraph . . . in a witness not invited to testify.\\" PAC's don't always win, but they are investors, betting on a high rate of return. They favor incumbents over challengers by a ratio of $10 to $1.   As for the millionaires, they were given a fast lane to political power in 1976 when the Supreme Court simultaneously upheld laws that limit contributions to candidates but struck down, on free-speech grounds, limits on spending by candidates. That has produced high rollers like Representative Michael Huffington, the Republican candidate for the Senate in California, who lent or gave himself at least $17 million this year, and Senator Herb Kohl, the Wisconsin Democrat whose own $3.5 million fund is 10 times the amount his challenger could raise.    The risk of encountering such a rich opponent also means that the moment they win one contest, legislators turn to special interests for help in amassing a huge war chest for the next. If they thus discourage a challenger, so much the better","excerpt":"they can then become a PAC themselves by giving to other campaigns -- or employ the imaginative strategies by which members continue to divert leftover campaign funds to personal spending: a car or two, restaurant accounts, a \\"study\\" trip abroad.    MINDFUL THAT JOURNALists, for some reason, are widely suspected of cynicism, let me turn from sordid reality to the realm of reform.    The most successful reform yet devised dealt with the election of Presidents. By raising a lot of money in small amounts, candidates can qualify for Federal matching funds and, if nominated, they can qualify for full subsidy by accepting a limit on total spending. That limit in 1992 was $55 million -- except that roundabout contributions to the Democratic and Republican Parties allowed them to spend an additional $71 million and $62 million respectively to help Bill Clinton and George Bush offset the challenge of Ross Perot's own $60 million.    A Federal Elections Commission is supposed to prevent such evasions, but its three members from each party can't often reach a majority decision of consequence. It is also woefully underfinanced; not until last May did it fine the Bush campaign for fund-raising violations in early 1988!   The larger lesson here is that money that wants to be spent will find a way to be spent, like water seeking its level. Limit spending for Clinton speeches and he'll find a surrogate to celebrate an unnamed political genius in Arkansas; limit spending on Bush rallies and he'll spend for \\"get out the vote\\" meetings in his Houston neighborhood. Give away free television time and the candidates will use the money they save to write personal letters to 150 million voters every week.    But no matter: if given abundant television time, no candidate would lack the means to get a well-rounded message to the electorate.  And if given enough television time in return for giving up TV ads, candidates would be liberated from endless fund-raising and from the dictates of special pleaders. A half-hour a day, including some prime time, for a few weeks before elections should suffice to cover all but very local races. Some interviews, some debates, with the real candidates, not hired guns and graphics.   Force campaign coverage onto broadcast television but not onto cable and into newspapers and magazines? Yes, indeed, and for very good reasons. Broadcast television has largely given up serious coverage of elections even as television commercials have become the main campaign arena. (Cable at least subsidizes the excellent C-Span programs.)   The most compelling reason, however, is that broadcast television bears a huge public debt. In exchange for the promise of \\"public service,\\" licensed television stations never paid a cent for the use of the broadcast spectrum or for the law that required cable systems to carry their programs. They still owe us, for many decades. Come the millennium, perhaps we'll collect and reclaim our democracy.

A frenzy to learn more about the ancient Maya, whose culture flourished in the Yucatan 3,000 years ago and whose ancestors still thrive by the millions in Mexico, Guatemala, Belize and western Honduras, may soon supplant our habit of looking chiefly to other continents to study pre-Christian advanced civilizations. For the decoding of Mayan hieroglyphs has revealed the startlingly sophisticated and brutal history of this Mesoamerican culture, described in painstaking detail by Linda Schele, a professor of art at the University of Texas, Austin, and David Freidel, an archeologist who teaches at Southern Methodist University. They helped decipher the glyphs and cartouches that reverse previous notions concerning the Maya's peaceful nature and uncomplicated existence. According to the authors, the three-tiered Maya world, consisting of \\"the starry arch of heaven, the stony Middleworld of earth made to flower and bear fruit by the blood of kings, and the dark waters of the Underworld below,\\" was \\"thought to be alive and imbued with sacred power, including the sky, which was represented by a great crocodilian monster. This Cosmic Monster made the rains when it shed its blood in supernatural counterpoint to the royal sacrifices on the earth below.\\" Ms. Schele and Mr. Freidel describe how oral tradition preserved many Mayan beliefs originally recorded on perishable paper","excerpt":"they claim that Central American festivals and such practices as shamanism derive from this ancient heritage. \\"The genius of the Maya was expressed through the creation of new visions of power,\\" they write. \\"They invented political symbols that transformed and coordinated such age-old institutions as the extended family, the village, the shaman, and the patriarch into the stuff of civilized life.\\" Although \\"A Forest of Kings\\" is in places thick with dry verbiage, it is throughout rich in revelatory research.
