Mr. Ginsberg was not then, in his words, \\"a big picture taker\\": he produced only 30 rolls of film between 1953 and 1963. Explaining why he took the pictures at all, Mr. Ginsberg writes that he simply \\"had a sacramental sense of these friends.\\" Encouraged and taught by such renowned photographers as Robert Frank and Berenice Abbott, Mr. Ginsberg developed into a gifted pictorial chronicler. Among the most appealing of these photographs (each accompanied by a caption handwritten by the photographer) is the \\"heroic portrait\\" of Jack Kerouac smoking a cigarette on a fire escape in New York City. Another shot shows Neal Cassady and Natalie Jackson embracing beneath a movie marquee advertising Marlon Brando in \\"The Wild One.\\" The book also features the now-famous photograph of Lawrence Ferlinghetti and his dog, Whitman, in San Francisco's City Lights Bookstore; portraits of such usual suspects as William Burroughs and Gregory Corso; and several fine, unflinching self-portraits. Snappily designed, \\"Snapshot Poetics\\" is an evocative riff on a specific slice of time in American literary history.\\nROBIN LIPPINCOTT IN SHORT: NONFICTION;\\nAnd the Beats Go On"},{"year":"1958","title":"TV program Ad World, trade show sponsored by indus, premieres","excerpt":"subliminal ad tested; seen failure New Trade Program"},{"year":"1957","title":"J Gould on dispute over use on TV A STATE OF MIND","excerpt":"Subliminal Advertising, Invisible to Viewer, Stirs Doubt and Debate"},{"year":"1964","title":"Three companies from the world of insurance, one of the nation's top industries, are represented at the World's Fair, and their sales pitch is either extremely soft, subliminal or nonexistent.

Several years ago, General Dynamics considered building a series of submarine tankers to carry liquid natural gas or oil from the Arctic to other regions. Traveling smoothly underwater they would not be subject to ocean storms and turbulence, and using advanced sonar technology, they could safely avoid any undersea mountain ranges or obstructions.    They could be an alternative to pipelines, which are subject to sabotage and environmental concerns.

It quickly acquired the reputation of being in a class by itself as a compendium of Hollywood scandal","excerpt":"subsequently, as the world grew more permissive, it became an international best seller, and it is not hard to see why. As a former child movie actor and a leading underground film maker, Mr. Anger knew his Hollywood from the inside, and in addition to being more candid than his predecessors, he brought enough wit and artistry to the book to make it something a good deal more stylish than a scissors-and-paste compilation.   In devising a sequel, Mr. Anger has been faced by two obvious problems. In the first place, he has already used up much of his best material. Fatty Arbuckle, Jean Harlow's wedding night, Mary Astor's diary, Errol Flynn and his wicked, wicked ways - even Hollywood cannot come up with an indefinite supply of such all-time greats. And the world really is less innocent - less innocent in its public assumptions, at least - than it once was.

It is true that Lenin after 1917 made a big point of changing the so-called \\"law of uneven development\\" that characterized earlier imperialisms and that subsequently the Central Asian republics gained at the expense of the Russian Republic. This Soviet policy has brought about some change in the behavior of neoimperialist powers, particularly in the period of the cold war. Foreign aid and foreign investment that resembles foreign aid, because it is eventually written off the books, are relatively new institutions.   What is interesting about the Plan Econ tables on subsidies by republic is that apparently Soviet policy has also been modified as a result of the changes brought about in World War II. The greatest recipients of subsidies from the Russian center have been those republics added as a result of the war, the three Baltic republics and Moldavia, presumably those with the least friendly populations. At the same time, less developed Turkmenia and Azerbaijan have received very little subsidy.   The Russians have correctly perceived the Lithuanians as the most problematic republic in the Soviet Union. And it is the one that has the most to lose from following a separatist path.

Take, for example, two pitch-black comedies by the Spanish director Luis Garcia Berlanga that are included in the series Spanish Eyes III: Classics of the Spanish Cinema, 1960-1975, which opens today at the Joseph Papp Public Theater. On the surface, both films, which were made during the waning years of the Franco dictatorship, don't seem particularly political. But peel away the humor, and you will find acerbic critiques of Spanish culture under Franco in which the bitterness is masked by farcical loquacity and absurdism.    Mr. Berlanga's 1961 film, \\"Placido,\\" which begins a six-night engagement this evening, is a chattery comedy about an impoverished man who spends the day before Christmas trying to avoid foreclosure on his motorbike. The character's frantic dealings with bankers and lawyers are set against the film's satirical canvas of a provincial town putting on a showy Christmas campaign called \\"Seat a Poor Man at Your Table.\\" With its harshly funny portrait of the penny-pinching gentry, of greedy nuns and aggressive salespeople pushing pressure cookers as miraculous kitchen tools, the film offers a scabrously mocking portrait of officialdom putting on a display that is as grotesque as it is hypocritical.

Above the ditch, clusters of 18-story office towers rise unexpectedly, like grain elevators on the vast one-story suburban prairie.   For developers, the suburban silos are bulging with profit. Last month, as the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority opened a new nine-mile extension of the Metro's east-west Orange Line into the booming Virginia suburbs, the five-year total of subway-inspired commercial construction reached 46 million square feet. When completed, the projects will represent a total investment by private developers of more than $3 billion, half the cost of the subway project itself to date.
