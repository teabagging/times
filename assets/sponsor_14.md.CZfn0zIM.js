For in its early scenes of men and women set against the hostile environment of the dust bowl and in the personal response of a pair of alien refugees to a new and unknown catastrophe the Messrs. Herbert, March and Ornitz have kept their story stripped, unpretentious and grimly honest. It is when the camera moves to the migrator, sequences that the personal dramas are lost and the film becomes glib and stilted, a fairy-tale version of \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" told without anger.The story has potency when it tells of the arrival of an elderly Viennese surgeon and his daughter, who have been driven from a gentler tradition and face the challenge of a small dust bowl community—a barren landscape where farmers in vacant bitterness watch the dry earth lift and move away, the cattle stand gaunt and the arms of the wind pump whirl madly above empty wells. But they remain, and when the community ultimately moves to the greener pastures of Oregon the two accompany them, no longer refugees but pioneers.But where the Okies of \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" found only a cruel mirage, these settlers find an Eden which is apparently there for the taking. The problem which the earlier film answered only inferentially is here given an answer that seems a little too pat and easy. The caravan's trek of 1,500 miles seemingly entails no hardship and is only momentarily halted by a pair of dissenters. And how a community supposedly ruined by dust storms manages to acquire rich bottomlands of Oregon with hardly any trouble isn't explained. An economic impasse can't be evaded by a trick with mirrors.The dialogue, too, is uneven, sometimes turning a dramatic situation into prolix discussion. When Leni, the daughter, informs her dust bowl swain that she is beginning to \\"take root\\" it is a denial of the essence of drama which should make such a bald statement unnecessary. Of the cast John Wayne, as the dogged young farmer, again turns in a performance of conviction and casual assurance","excerpt":"Charles Coburn as the surgeon and Spencer Charters as a grizzled townsman are excellent, and Sigrid Gurie is less than adequate as the heroine.

C. WYETH: A Biography, by David Michaelis. (Perennial/HarperCollins, $24.95.) The first biography of the illustrator and painter N. C. Wyeth (1882-1945) portrays him not just as the patriarch of a famously art-obsessed family but as an exacting artist whose accomplishments (notably his illustrations for ''Treasure Island'' and other classic texts) were larger than one might have imagined. This is ''a full-scale, many-voiced, deeply researched study,'' Adam Gopnik wrote in these pages in 1998. The Wyeths ''emerge as both more likable and more Gothic than one had expected: half Pennsylvania Bruegels, half the Addams Family.''    FAIR WARNING, by Robert Olen Butler. (Grove, $12.) This novel's heroine recounts her dazzling career as a fine-arts auctioneer whose bravura performances involve pumping up the cupidity and insecurity of her wealthy audience to a point where a successful bid becomes an orgasmic necessity. The result is ''witty, airily entertaining . . . between a comedy of manners and a philosophic comedy,'' Richard Eder said here last year.    BREAKING CLEAN, by Judy Blunt. (Vintage, $13.) The author describes the 12 hard years she spent as a Montana farm wife, mother and ranch laborer, starting with her (virtually arranged) marriage as a teenager and winding up with her decision to sever generations of tradition and expectation by divorcing her husband and becoming a writer. Her ''powerful memoir'' is ''a judgment-free depiction of a place and time and ethic most of us will never experience,'' Elizabeth Gilbert wrote here in 2002.    THE ENGLISHMAN'S DAUGHTER: A True Story of Love and Betrayal in World War I, by Ben Macintyre. (Delta, $13.95.) Excavating a remarkable but little-known incident, the author tells of the concealment of four stranded British soldiers in an occupied French village, and of their eventual betrayal and execution. His account, which draws on the recollections of a woman he met in 1997 whose father was one of the soldiers, ''finds not just the sorrow and the pity in this conquered district but the moral confusion as well,'' Thomas Mallon said in these pages last year.    AMERICA'S FIRST DYNASTY: The Adamses, 1735-1918, by Richard Brookhiser. (Free Press, $14.) This group portrait takes brief measure of four generations of brilliant, successful and flawed men: John and John Quincy, the former presidents","excerpt":"Charles Francis, a diplomat; and Henry, a writer and historian who felt himself a failure. The result is a ''succinct and skillfully written'' book, Jeff Shesol wrote in the Book Review in 2002.    SOURCE: Poems, by Mark Doty. (Perennial/HarperCollins, $12.95.) In his sixth collection of verse, the poet explores themes of selfhood -- in particular, through ruminations on cityscapes, people and paintings, the nature of the American self. Last year our reviewer, Ruth Padel, said ''Doty is a poet of glow'' who ''finds ways to bring the 'source' of being alive up to the surface of his poems.''    HOUSE OF WOMEN, by Lynn Freed. (Back Bay/Little, Brown, $12.95.) Secret gardens, a woman trapped in a tower and a wicked sister are among the fairy tale elements infusing this dark, dreamlike novel about the intensely symbiotic relationship between an aging opera singer and Holocaust survivor and her daughter, with whom she becomes locked in a struggle to the death. The result is ''an unusual and unusually satisfying'' work, Kathryn Harrison wrote in the Book Review in 2002.    A MIND OF ITS OWN: A Cultural History of the Penis, by David M. Friedman. (Penguin, $15.) This chronicle of the penis over the centuries covers everything from papal testicular exams in the 1400's to mankind's long battle against impotence and the current pharmaceutical ''erection industry.'' The result is a ''surprisingly smart, concentrated'' study, Mike Albo said here last year.    ONE STEP BEHIND, by Henning Mankell. (Vintage Crime, $13.) In this Swedish police procedural, a conscience-driven detective suspects departmental corruption may have had a role in the murder of three young people dressed up in 18th-century costumes for a Midsummer's Eve party in the woods. ''The sweep and complexity of Mankell's plot are reason enough for tackling this dense book,'' Marilyn Stasio said here in 2002. ''But his meditations on surprising subjects like time travel and 'man's relationship to monsters' make him something special.''

For, while George Raft does help himself to a slice of \\"dangerous living\\" and a modicum of romance, he is acting as though he never left home. The Mediterranean locale nothwithstanding, our hero has been through all this, or a reasonable facsimile thereof, a few times before at several studios hard by the Pacific. And, he isn't generating any great excitement this time either.Say this for Kaydor Productions, lowever. The independent company, which took cameras to those European spas captured some eye-filling and rugged scenery, both natural and man-made. The story, transported and filmed abroad, is something else again. On this excursion into crime Raft is cast as an American gambler vacationing in San Paolo, who runs afoul of an international ring of counterfeiters, a fact, incidentally, that isn't made clear until a good deal of footage has been expended. What is obvious, however, is that our man will be and is chased all over the rocky coast before he, an Italian Treasury agent, his girl friend, an Italian gamin and several others capture the culprits.As the gambling gent, who takes to his heels to avoid being the patsy in the murder of an American T-Man, George Raft is, as has been noted, working in a tailormade role. He is laconic, a smooth tango dancer, tough on dastards and easy on the eyes of several ladies. Chief among these is Coleen Gray, who unwittingly entices him into a trap but is willing to make up for it later. If one watches carefully, other susceptible dames arrive and swiftly depart from his orbit, among them being Constance Smith, Greta Gynt and Margot Grahame.Enzo Staiola, the appealing Italian youngster who made a hit in \\"The Bicycle Thief,\\" does a competent job as a shoeshine boy who aids Raft","excerpt":"Charles Goldner is restrained as his Italian accomplice and Walter Rilla, Martin Benson and Peter Illing, as the leading villains of the piece, strenuously essay to be adequate in stereotyped roles.

By Elsa Lanchester. Illustrated. 269 pp. New York: Harcourt, Brace & Co. $3.50."},{"year":"1936","title":"Simplicity is a dangerous word to pin upon so diffuse a work as Victor Hugo's \\"Les Misérables,\\" yet it is simplicity—simplicity of production, of mood, of performance and direction—which distinguishes the French film edition of the classic now being shown at the Cinema de Paris and lends it dignity, strength and a measure of great beauty.Eighteen months have passed since Hollywood presented its version of the novel and time has blurred all but two images","excerpt":"Charles Laughton as the relentless Inspector Javert and Fredric March as the harried Jean Valjean. When another eighteen months have gone, I am sure we shall have a different recollection of this new \\"Les Misérables.\\" There will be no spotlight of memory playing steadily upon one or two characters, but a warm glow gently suffusing an entire, well-rounded production.For this is a thoroughgoing edition of Hugo, telescoped perforce, but not a sketchy abridgment nor a high-lighting, however admirable, of one phase of the novel. The picture has a running time of two and three-quarter hours, but you probably will not be conscious of its length. Raymond Bernard, its director, has not wasted footage. Although the film is not keyed to the Hollywood tempo, it is no laggard, and it moves swiftly when there is need. And always, as it moves, the camera reaches out to seize upon some bright detail of scene or incident or characterization and use it to enrich its filmic pages.It is part of the simplicity of the Gallic producers that they do not require, as Hollywood always requires, that their leading man be handsome. Here Jean Valjean is represented by Harry Baur, an actor with gross features, beady eyes, shaggy brows, a shambling walk and alarming girth, with none of the implied asceticism of Mr. March, bestial in appearance rather than long-suffering. Mr. March had your sympathy from the moment you saw him; Mr. Baur's Valjean must overcome repugnance to win yours, and that he does, utterly, is the most objective way of appraising a magnificent performance.In Charles Vanel's Javert, the film is less fortunate, although that admittedly is less the actor's fault than the producer's. Mr. Vanel unquestionably comes closer to Hugo's description of Javert than Mr. Laughton, but his motivation in tracking down Valjean—his fanatical obedience to duty, to his code—is not brought out with sufficient clarity, and for that reason Javert lacks dimension. On the same count, the picture has made less capital than did Twentieth Century's version of the implacability of the man hunt in which Javert epitomized the eternal bloodhound, Valjean the eternal quarry. It is still a story of the chase, but the personal equation has been removed. It is not as strong dramatically.Yet there are compensations in superabundance. The trial at Arras, at which Valjean appears to save Champmathieu from going to the galleys in his stead; the episode dealing with the waif, Cosette, in the Thenardier's inn; the fight at the barricades, Valjean's horrible descent into the sewers bearing the wounded Marius—these have been plucked living from Hugo's pages and turned vividly into the classical literature of the screen. And there are, through it all, settings of undeniable authenticity and performances of rare quality. Beyond question, the French \\"Les Misérables\\" has its faults, but only the hyper-critical could be blinded by them to its equally unquestionable excellence. Two From France: 'Les Miserables,' at the Cinema de Paris, and 'The Mysteries of Notre Dame.'"},{"year":"1932","title":"Experiences in N Y A \\"VILLAIN\\" IN NEW YORK","excerpt":"Charles Laughton Finds That Five Pictures Have Made Him Known to the City"},{"year":"1944","title":"HOLLYWOOD, Calif., March 1 -- Charles Laughton has been signed by Universal to star in \\"The Suspect,\\" a murder mystery to be based on James Ronald's novel, \\"This Way Out.\\" The film will be produced by Islin Auster.

The homicide itself is slipshod, sober and rather arrogantly routine in arrangement. But when Ned Sparks walks on the scene as the detective in the case, all hands wake up and the film begins to sparkle. Mr. Sparks has the full-bodied part that his admirers have always hoped for. Sadder of countenance and more cynical of speech than he has ever been, he quizzes witnesses and investigates clues with such comic gravity that half of his lines are lost in the uproarious laughter of the customers out front.The mystery itself is ingenious enough, but the director has not done it justice. Mr. Somers, the building magnate, is up to his neck in trouble and proposes to kill himself. He persuades his young office assistant to hide the gun and remove the powder marks so that his heavy insurance will not be negated by his suicide. About the time he is preparing to destroy his troubled life, a mysterious Mr. X beats him to it. When the police arrive, nearly everybody in the Somers office has a special reason for not telling the truth. As Mr. Sparks acidly observes, the Somers office force has as careless a manner with the facts as the speakers at a Presidential convention.Zasu Pitts flutters in her best style under the detective's merciless probing.

Indeed, that's one reason the Spoleto arts festival is so embraced, for it serves as the city's grand farewell before the long, sullen days of summer. \\n\\n      This month marks Spoleto's 20th Charleston festival, about 19 more than skeptics thought the city could support.

This writer's random surveys show classical music to be the most preferred, with talk radio ranking surprisingly high and, in the warm months, many painters listening to a baseball game while working. But a large number listen to jazz, and the fact that jazz stimulates artists doesn't need explanation.\\n\\nIn a pleasant, 11-artist exhibition at the Rye Art Center entitled \\"The Color of Jazz and Blues,\\" the bull is taken by the horns, and the strong comparison between jazz and painting is made at the outset. \\n\\nIn 1951, the influential art critic Henry McBride wrote in Art News: \\n\\n\\"There is a temptation to think the artist a musician as well as a painter, for he starts softly on the blank page like a musician improvising and as he sees a subtle motif taking shape, flings into it with confidence, plays it up for what it is worth and then, satisfied he has gone the whole way with it, permits it to fade softly out.\\" \\n\\nMcBride doubtlessly was thinking of the working method of Actionpainters like Jackson Pollock, who we know was a jazz buff. And along with Pollock, pioneering painters like Mondrian -- with his influential \\"Broadway Boogiewoogie\\" -- and Stuart Davis fit easily into anyone's jazz/painting pantheon.\\n\\nThe painters at Rye, all black artists, are mostly of a younger generation, and much of the work was painted in the last couple of years. Many record the jazz scene in figures, rather than recapitulate its colors, textures and rhythms with the devices of abstraction. But it all adds up to a lively and moving exhibition.\\n\\nChronologically, the show begins somberly with \\"Orphan Band,\\" painted in 1934 by Malvin Gray Johnson. Neither the onlookers nor most of the band in their plain uniforms seem to be under the sway of jazz, but the leader, who hunkers down a bit, is in the spirit.\\n\\nIn \\"Blues Singer\\" by Charles Alston, painted in 1955, the white flower is at the woman's shoulder rather than in her hair, so she is not Billie Holiday specifically. But there is strong emotion in this painting, signaled by the intense red of the woman's dress. Overlapping, proto-Cubist rectangles in the background are an earmark of this work, which was painted in the 1950's. \\n\\nThe celebrated Romare Beardenspent much time in the studio of Stuart Davis, where he doubtlessly imbibed much information about collage and the layering of artistic motifs. An elaborate collage look is present in an etching, \\"Jamming at the Savoy,\\" which depicts a full orchestra, while in \\"Back in Kansas City\\" there is a contrast between a strong monochromatic background and the three musicians who are cut out of a single sheet and painted in filmy watercolor. \\n\\nThrough Bearden's expertise we understand how the layering of motifs in collage is very much like the layering of musical motifs in jazz. But also handy with scissors is Camille Billops, whose cutout silhouettes in \\"Dance Collage\\" might be the ink-on-paper figures of \\"Buck and Bubbles,\\" seen going on stage in the drawing by Marion Brown, going with special alacrity into their dance. The very \\"with it\\" dancing goat in Ms. Billops's other contribution is the single most fetching character in the exhibition.\\n\\nA woman's face painted on a cello lets us know that Michael Singleterry understands that jazz and collage are blood brothers, but a more interesting document is Mr. Singleterry's \\"Is It Still Wet?\\" A good piece of this painting is a realistic jazz combo but most of it is a solid mass of white acrylic with some dripping a la Jackson Pollock invading the figures' territory.\\n\\nA good case can be made that Norman Lewis was the most important black painter who can be included in a discussion on Abstract Expressionism. Painted in 1960, Lewis's untitled moody painting here reminds this viewer of the major work of Arshile Gorky, the vanguard Abstract Expressionist. Patches of intense color, which Lewis endowed with a myriad of eyes, emerge from a neutral ground that some critics have written Lewis identified with \\"emptiness.\\" \\n\\nOne might feel a touch guilty embracing, in this context, Joe Overstreet's paintings, which are tangential to the jazz theme. As his pastel pallette might indicate, Mr. Overstreet is painting nostalgically, evoking the time in the early years of this century when New Orleans's Storyville District was in flower. The pleasure in his painting \\"The French Quarter\\" is seeing the figures, the nude women and the piano player, emerge from an Impressionist haze and acquire specificity. \\n\\nThe last four works become object lessons about the incorporation of jazz rhythms and texture into visual art. Catti, an artist who goes by that name only, presents a lineup of red shield-like forms that establish a strong steady rhythm, while James Phillips's jagged forms remind one of the word balloons in comic strips that express violent action, like \\"Pow!\\" \\n\\nSam Middleton's silk screens are inspirations from specific jazz compositions","excerpt":"Charlie Mingus's \\"SwedishPastry\\" is appropriately done in yellow and light blue. A pair of collaborators, the trumpeter Miles Davis and Jo Gelbard, may have had a heavy and light contrast in mind as evanescent faces contrast with assemblage elements: rope, bamboo and rusted hardware.

This, of course, necesitates carrying on the deception so that the old gentleman will bequeath his money without ever finding out that the real wife is a person who, in his judgment, is insane.The picture itself goes almost insane at times, for it possesses so many irrational moments that its logical points seem strangely out of place.Miss Greenwood, who appeared in the stage version about ten or so years ago, does exceedingly well in her part of the light-headed wife.

It is a satisfying production, with excellent acting by several small children, among whom is an unusually able youngster of about 6, who enjoys the impressive name of Kendall McComas.Some of the early flashes in the orphan home are perhaps unnecessarily harsh, but when Master McComas as Freddie Perkins, who is rather pleased when he is called \\"a very dangerous boy,\\" steals several large spoonfuls of jam and hides the sticky concoction on a slice of bread under his blouse, he is extraordinarily amusing. Master McComas has the confidence of a grown-up. He is not in the least dismayed by either the microphone or the camera and not once does he hesitate in speaking his lines. He looks as if he thoroughly enjoyed the work, particularly the jam scene and one in which he is discovered by the matron with several lumps of sugar in his mouth.Miss Gaynor as Judy Abbott, the drudge of the orphan home, reveals a great improvement in her diction. Judy, it may be remembered, is a cheerful lass who tells stories to the children, and they hang on every word she utters. When she says something about ice cream, one tot ejaculates, \\"What flavor?\\"As for Warner Baxter, the Daddy Long Legs of this film, he is again much too careful about his attire. Nevertheless, his performance is good. In one sequence he plays football with the boys of the home, of which he is a trustee, and the matron, Mrs. Lippett, appears and scolds the youngsters when all of them are on top of Jervis Pendleton, Daddy Long Legs's real name. Mrs. Lippett finally observes Pendleton, whom she does not know, and instructs him to get off the grounds. A little later she realizes the faux pas she has made.Pendleton is responsible for Judy's release from the orphanage and also for sending her to college, but he does not let her know that he is her benefactor. Once, just before leaving the orphanage, she espies merely a lengthened shadow of the individual who has come to her assistance, and therefore she calls her benefactor Daddy Long Legs. She pictures him as tall, bald, elderly and kindly.There is no little charm in those scenes where Pendleton finds that he has fallen in love with Judy, who, still unaware that Daddy Long Legs and Jervis Pendleton are one and the same, reciprocates the affection. All that remains to be done is for her to ask the permission of Daddy Long Legs to become Pendleton's wife, which affords Alfred Santell, the director, an opportunity of giving several pleasing touches to his closing scenes.Una Merkel does exceedingly well as Judy's college chum. This young actress never misses an opportunity to score, and her lines are a source of considerable fun. Louise Closser Hale figures, in a minor part. Claude Gillingwater Sr. is capital as Pendleton's manager, who is not in sympathy with his employer's interest in Judy.On the Roxy stage there is a number entitled \\"Modern Cinderella,\\" with the Roxyettes, the ballet corps and the chorus. Patricia Bowman appears as Cinderella and Vincent Dimitry as the Prince. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"Charm and Sentiment. The Stool Pigeon. In the South Seas.

It has its picturesque and charming moments with its flavor of a period in which men wore powdered wigs and fought duels and women's ankles were hidden beneath a maze of garments.Filmed in technicolor, which shows up rather well, the photoplay trips along its operetta-like course over such hazards as singing outlaws and a gout-ridden old gentleman who insists on duelling from a bath chair. The story has many imaginative moments and much handsome scenery and settings.Kitty Bellairs, a famous flirt of her day, comes to Bath, England, for the season. Her path is strewn with a number of conquests, including an enamored highwayman, a lord and some others who hang on her every word.There is the usual complication common to such plays in which Kitty sacrifices herself to save the name of her sister, when she steps from behind the curtains in the young lord's room and claims a woman's slipper which has been found. Things emerge satisfactorily when the young nobleman proves himself not the supposed poet but the bold bandit.While the offering is none too clever in subject material and at times becomes operetta-conscious in a dull way, it nevertheless moves across the screen in an agreeable fashion and is quite satisfactory entertainment.Claudia Dell as Kitty is satisfactory, as is Ernest Torrence in the rôle of the irascible Sir Jasper. Walter Pidgeon, who plays the part of the young lord, is acceptable.
