This result has been due partly to the fact that few English theatres are yet equipped to show American talking pictures, partly to the increase in British production and largely because more German films are being imported.According to a statement this week by J. C. Graham, managing director of Paramount's English branch, this shortage of American films will in a few months become much more pronounced. Mr. Graham has just returned from a six week's trip to the United States where he went to study the \\"talkie\\" situation. This is his report:\\"A very evident shortage of silent films will soon begin to be apparent in the schedules of American producing companies, beginning with the second half of the present American season, or approximately March 1 next. This shortage will only begin to be apparent to the British exhibitor about the time he finds it necessary to book American productions for exhibition in Great Britain, beginning about Jan. 1, 1930. In my opinion, the principal American producing companies will not be able to offer the British exhibitor more than 50 per cent of their present output of silent productions and several independent producers will disappear entirely. The silent small program picture featuring stars of lesser light will vanish for the simple reason that productions of this kind will not be able to find any first run in America. This, therefore, will make it necessary for the British exhibitor to book more British, German and French silent productions if he desires to continue operating his theatre on a silent basis and intends to show as many pictures.\\"Britons from Missouri.Mr. Graham reinforced his remarks with an appreciation of the whole-heartedness of Hollywood's determination to concentrate on sound productions. The moral of all this would seem to be that Britain must soon take American sound pictures or none at all.British exhibitors, however, have still \\"got to be shown.\\" Far from altering their attitude of conservatism toward the \\"talkies,\\" they have just stiffened it. H. Victor Davis, president of the powerful Cinematograph Exhibitors' Association, issued another warning to its members a few days ago against being in haste to sign contracts for American sound reproducing installations. \\"The main point is,\\" he said, \\"that we are against the American method of doing business, and British exhibitors are not going to ??? that method. In the near future an interchangeable device will be brought upon the market by which it is hoped to reproduce every method of talking films. That is what we should wait for.\\"Meanwhile, British exhibitors continue to show silent pictures and British film fans show no tendency to grow tired of them. Why should they, when the quality of silent films has so steadily improved? I have had occasion so often to criticize the merit of British production that it is with pleasure I am able to say something about some recent British films that give promise of much batter things. Of these the most ambitious is the Gainsborough production, \\"The First Born.\\" It is, to begin with, a remarkable tour de force on the part of Miles Mander, since not only did Mr. Mander act the leading part, but collaborated in this screen adaptation of his own play, taken from his own book. He also directed the picture. Mr. Mander had already made a name for himself by his acting in \\"The Fake\\" and \\"The Physician.\\" In all his parts he has hitherto been cast as a weakling or a villain. In this he is again villainous, but only in his relations with woman. Otherwise he is successful and popular, \\"a good fellow.\\" In the intervals between his affairs with other women he alternately bullies and pets his young wife, makes her so angry that she throws things at him in helpless rage, makes her jealous as well, but keeps her love. What is more, rather than continue to deserve his reproaches for her childlessness, the wife adopts a child while he is abroad and passes it off as her own. Suspicions and then insults follow which almost provoke the wife to an acceptance of another love, one which carries with it a devotion and a fidelity that she has failed to find in her husband. But when that handsome, charming rake meets with swift and terrible death in a lift shaft his faults are forgiven and his memory promises to make a permanent widow of the loving young wife. Only when it develops that the adopted child is really the husband's, begotten of a liaison with his wife's manicurist, does she conclude that she has wasted her devotion on something that never existed, and turn to the real love that still awaits her.\\"Widdicombe Fair.\\"It is the acting and treatment that make this melodramatic story one of the most successful first films ever directed in this country. Mr. Mander acts the thoroughly objectionable part he has written for himself with such brio that we never lose interest in his blackguardism. And either he has convinced Miss Madeleine Carroll as the young wife that she is a first rate emotional actress or Miss Carroll herself has just discovered it. In this picture she has to persuade us that she is human, loving, foolish in her fidelity to her faithless husband but not a fool. She does so She persuades us further that not all English screen heroines need be stolid even when they are portraying virtue.A very different kind of picture is Norman Walker's \\"Widdecombe Fair.\\" Here is a film essentially English in setting and in its human types. How many Americans know the famous old song from which it takes its title, the ballad that immortalizes Uncle Tom Cobleigh, Bill Brewer, Jan Stewer and Peter Gurney and not least the gray mare on whose overburdened back they all traveled to Widdicombe Fair? But whether they have ever heard it, or ever seen the sweep of Devonshire hills and valleys which furnishes the setting for this richly humorous story of Eden Philpotts, they will like the film. The background is English country scenery at its best. Claude Friese-Greene's camera work is superb whether he is showing you a fox hunt, a panorama of woods and meadows or a delightful interior shot of an old-fashioned Devon farmhouse. Mr. Philpotts's story is simple but embellished with hilarious rustic humors. The acting is good all round.

The dances from the Britten opera are played in a setting by Mr. Bream for lute, violin, flute, alto flute, piccolo, bass viols and tabor, and these too are delightful, for the music has both an authentically archaic and fresh sound.

In it women suffer unjustly, but Benjamin Britten's chamber opera, composed as World War II was ending, probably had a broader notion of violent conquest on its mind. The story is from Rome: a prince's violation of a companion's virtuous wife and her suicide because of it.   Past and present are stacked like layers in this opera. The stern, often cruel standards of an ancient civilization are depicted but through a modern Christian's eyes. A chorus of two singers (Carl Halvorson and Karen Hale) narrates and offers commentary. A stage work takes on the air of an Anglican church service in which text and sermon provide moral guides for communicants.

Such is the peaceful conclusion of this tortured work, which Kurt Masur conducted on Thursday night in Avery Fisher Hall in the final subscription programs of his first season as music director of the New York Philharmonic.   Mr. Masur did not lightly choose the 85-minute \\"War Requiem\\" for these concerts. It was commissioned for the consecration of a new cathedral at Coventry, built alongside the ruins of the 14th-century building destroyed by the Nazis in 1940. At the premiere in 1962, English and German soloists, Peter Pears and Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, were meant to represent the nations that fought during that war. And Britten meant to construct a dramatic argument for pacifism, intertwining the Latin Mass for the Dead with the bitterly ironic antiwar poetry of Wilfred Owen, who was killed in the final days of World War I.

In a theater year marked by signs of an American musical renaissance on Broadway and an explosion of American playwriting off Broadway, \\"Falsettos\\" is a show in which the boundary separating Off Broadway and Broadway is obliterated, a show in which the most stylish avatars of the new American musical embrace the same thorny urban landscape of embattled men and women to be found in so many new American plays.    The evening also brings this highly charged season to a close with the charged emotions of an eagerly awaited reunion. \\"Falsettos\\" is the seamless merging of two one-act musicals, \\"March of the Falsettos\\" and \\"Falsettoland,\\" that were produced individually in 1981 and 1990. All three original leading men -- Michael Rupert, Stephen Bogardus and Chip Zien -- are back, as is the original director, James Lapine (who is also co-author of the book). A lot has happened to them since they and \\"Falsettos\\" first came together. A lot has happened to the audience. Like any reunion worth attending, this one tempers its feelings of joy with those of deep loss. The wave of euphoria \\"Falsettos\\" evokes is inseparable from the wave of tears that rises audibly through the house once Mr. Finn raises the ghosts of those Falsettoland loved ones no longer here to join the party.

It champions the theater with eloquence and, at its best, does so by example rather than by preaching. The author, Timberlake Wertenbaker, has adapted the work from a historical novel (\\"The Playmaker\\") by Thomas Keneally about the first play produced in Australia in its earliest days as a penal colony. The play was George Farquhar's \\"Recruiting Officer,\\" a Restoration comedy of 1706, and the actors who performed it were the hungry and mostly illiterate criminals, outcasts and misfits that Georgian England had banished Down Under in 1788.

In the penny-pinching world of dance, however, a junior company like Ailey II has been about as far as it goes. That may be changing, as name-brand dance troupes take on the kind of multiplicity that has served other genres so well. Momix, based in Connecticut and known for its onstage illusions, has performed the neat trick of expanding into three touring units, with a total of 30 dancers. One of the three Momixes comes to the Joyce starting Tuesday.    Cynthia Quinn, the 25-year-old company's associate director (and companion of its founder, Moses Pendleton), said the three units performed as much from January to March as a single company could in nine months.
