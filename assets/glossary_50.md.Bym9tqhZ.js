It is not exactly a secret that for quite a few years now the production of ceramic sculpture has occupied an important place on the California art scene. Yet, although we have seen a good deal of this work in New York in recent years - some of it in the Whitney's own Biennial exhibitions - until now none of our museums has attempted to encompass the movement in a definitive survey. In organizing the present exhibition, then, the Whitney has brought us our first interesting account of an artistic phenomenon that has won much national and international attention, and a phenomenon, moreover, that has for us the additional interest of having no exact counterpart on the New York art scene.   The exhibition is a joint effort of the Whitney and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, and was organized by Richard Marchall, associate curator of exhibitions at the Whitney, and Suzanne Foley, a former curator at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art who has been in a position to follow the development of the ceramic sculpture movement fairly closely. The exhibition will be shown in San Francisco from April 8 to June 27.
