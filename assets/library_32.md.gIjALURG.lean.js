THE BEAUTY OF THE HUSBAND: A Fictional Essay in 29 Tangos, by Anne Carson. (Knopf, $22.) Poems are they, these objects? Whatever, they are bold and abbreviated, they fear no free association and no kind of knowledge or desire and are overtly concerned with the ways intellectual discernment can clash with erotic taste.    SAILING ALONE AROUND THE ROOM: New and Selected Poems, by Billy Collins. (Random House, $21.95.) Clean, suburban, antiseptic, humorous poems by the new poet laureate of the United States. Death, longing and regret figure in his work, but only at the margins","excerpt":"the heart remains funny.    MARY SHELLEY, by Miranda Seymour. (Grove, $35.) The author (at 19!) of ''Frankenstein'' lived at the center of English Romanticism and knew all its characters; Seymour's new biography sketches the scientific background of ''Frankenstein'' and delineates the Shelley-Byron circle, including the sexual who-whom that rotated around its two dominant rich kids.    THE WORLD BELOW, by Sue Miller. (Knopf, $25.) The grasp of this ambitious novel stretches to seven generations; the narrator, an up-to-date twice-divorced mother, hears in her grandmother's journals the voice of a simpler time, and recognizes the weight and power of the pastoral impulse, valuable however much it is recognized as a simplification.    VENICE: LION CITY. The Religion of Empire, by Garry Wills. (Simon & Schuster, $35.) A cultural historian's guide to the Most Serene Republic through the arts, beliefs and ideologies that sustained it in its days as a medium-great power, able to withstand the Turks in the Mediterranean and rule much of Italy.    THE PRACTICAL HEART: Four Novellas, by Allan Gurganus. (Knopf, $25.) Well, some of them are more like memoirs than novellas. The title story, about a woman who got herself painted by Sargent, is an elusive Jamesian affair; there's also a coming-out story, a ditsy ramble from a preservationist journal and ''Saint Monster,'' about a boy who unwillingly destroys his father.    BORROWED FINERY: A Memoir, by Paula Fox. (Holt, $23.) A fascinating, fragmentary account by a novelist who has repeatedly put her life in her fiction; in reality, Fox's existence was somehow a calamitous insult to her mother, who got rid of her as fast as possible.    THE SAVAGE GIRL, by Alex Shakar. (HarperCollins, $26.) A wild first novel about a young woman who has moved to Middle City and taken a job with a trend-spotting visionary who sees a perfect product in diet water.

EVA MOVES THE FURNITURE, by Margot Livesey. (Holt, $23.) A Scottish woman, born in 1920, is accompanied all her life by a woman and a girl who are invisible to everyone else in this often sad and scary novel. Sometimes they help her out, sometimes they determine her life without regard to her own preferences. And they never explain themselves.    MARIE ANTOINETTE: The Journey, by Antonia Fraser. (Nan A. Talese/Doubleday, $35.) A biographer of royalties argues persuasively for a romantic view of the French queen who enraged the subjects by frivolities but transformed herself, at last, to a courageous, decisive, devoted wife and mother.    MARLON BRANDO, by Patricia Bosworth. (Lipper/Viking, $21.95.) Life and art, politics and marital complications, all are put in place and context in this life of an actor whose weird verisimilitude nobody can stop watching, whatever trivial part he has played in the 54 years since ''A Streetcar Named Desire.''    ALMOST, by Elizabeth Benedict. (Houghton Mifflin, $24.) A nearly-mystery novel nicely constructed around a ghastly premise: Sophy, the narrator and protagonist, has found new love with Daniel in the last stage of her divorce from Will when Will is found dead in dreadful circumstances. Complications ensue, of course.    POLITICAL FICTIONS, by Joan Didion. (Knopf, $25.) Bitter observations on the last dozen years by a novelist and a child of American conservatism whose recent career has been a running disenchantment with the ''permanent political class,'' the professionals who manage policy and those who report on it.    A TRIAL BY JURY, by D. Graham Burnett. (Knopf, $21.) The foreman of a contentious criminal jury on a tawdry New York homicide case last year found the justice system a mare's-nest of incompetence and confusion, and his own experience more intense than he had bargained for; in the end, a certain common sense prevailed.    ALFRED RUSSEL WALLACE: A Life, by Peter Raby. (Princeton University, $26.95.) A well-researched, graceful biography of an English naturalist, a titan of self-effacement, who just missed being a household word because Charles Darwin was ready before he was with a book proposing ''the origin of species by means of natural selection.''

A historian's report on a district that has lost its name but continues to attract immigrants and the poor, often showing a lively street culture.    LIGHTNING FIELD, by Dana Spiotta. (Scribner, $23.) A first novel, placed in a film-setty Los Angeles, by a satirist whose central character is a defiant walker in Four-Wheel City who prefers in-between places and is more likely to be en route to somewhere than to arrive to meet her husband or lovers.

FLIGHTS OF LOVE: Stories, by Bernhard Schlink. (Pantheon, $23.)

There seems to be no center in Ms. May's work, no character to which we can attach ourselves, no matter how lightly, and feel that this person, if far from perfect, is at least morally acceptable, someone to whom we can throw our sympathy and support.

There is nearly always an obvious effort to mislead spectators, readers or audiences into suspecting the hero or heroine, although no one ever suspects either for a moment, and at the end the foregone conclusion that the crime was committed by some one who has been carefully denied popular sympathy is revealed by clever detective work or an accommodating trick of fate—and the mystery is solved.\\"One Hour Before Dawn,\\" a screen adaptation of Mansfield Scott's novel, \\"Behind Red Curtains,\\" at the Capitol this week, is a mystery story, and as mechanical as most of its kind. There is never any mystery about it, except, perhaps, in the question of which of two equally unattractive men the author will arbitrarily select as the murderer when the time comes to acquit the hero.But for all this, the photoplay is more interesting than many mystery movies. In the first place, its photography in general is excellent. Also a number of scenes meant to be \\"creepy\\" are made so by the cinematographic skill of Henry King, presumably, who directed the production. And the acting is good, especially that of H. B. Warner and Frank Leigh. Furthermore, the introduction of the motive of hypnotism into the \\"mystery\\" gives an opportunity for a nearer approach to something really mysterious than is usual in the \\"Who Killed Cock Robin?\\" works. The story accepts hypnotism as a fact, but offers the question, Can the hypnotist make a good man do an evil thing? The hypnotist in the case (Frank Leigh) believes that he can","excerpt":"the hero (H. B. Warner) denies it. The hero submits to hypnotism, and the hypnotist commands him to \\"kill Harrison Kirke one hour before dawn.\\" One hour before dawn the hero dreams of killing Kirke and the next morning Kirke is found dead. The hero doesn't know whether he is the murderer and spends an anxious hour before his growing sense of guilt is dispelled by a detective able to detect something.In showing the hypnotist at work, the hero's hypnotically suggested dream of murder and the actions of the hero and the hypnotist after the crime the motion pictures are able to stir up considerable interest, especially as the acting of the principals in these scenes concerned is convincing. So, if the spectator will not be too exacting in his demand for logic and honesty in the plot and will forget the formula for a while, he can be pleasantly interested in much of \\"One Hour Before Dawn.\\"The Capitol program also includes an amusing Harold Lloyd comedy, entitled \\"High and Dizzy,\\" and Prizma color pictures of the Victory parade in Paris.There are many chances for original comedy, with satirical emphasis, in the story of \\"The City of Masks,\\" from the novel by George Barr McCutcheon, at the Rialto this week, and the picture seizes some of them, though by no means all. It misses numerous opportunities because it takes its \\"romance\\" too seriously. The central situation is full of possibilities. A number of foreign Nobles, several Lords and Ladies, a Duke or two, a Princess and their former servants have been \\"Americanized\\" into a chauffeur, a governness, a female pawnbroker, a political boss, two shopkeepers and an indigent musician, and, while filling their publicly accepted positions seven days and six nights of the week, meet every Wednesday evening to \\"hold court\\" in Continental style. Thrown into contact with them in real life are such types of Western democracy as idle millionaires, ambitious parvenus and blundering policemen. The result is satirical comedy—and it is good, though not as good and abundant as it could have been, largely because Lord Eric, who is a chauffeur, and Lady Jane, who is a governness, are in love with each other and their conventional \\"romance,\\" with its difficulties and dangers to each, is treated too fully and too much in the spirit of the usual movie stuff.Good character parts are contributed by Theodore Kosloff (perhaps a comer on the screen), Edward Jobson, J. M. Dumont, Anne Schaefer, George Berrell and Snitz Edwards. Robert Warwick is the somewhat too ponderous hero, and Lois Wilson is an attractive heroine.The cinematography, on the whole, is noteworthy, especially that of the snow and night scenes. The production was directed by Thomas Heffron.On the Rialto program is a scenic, \\"Creation's Morning,\\" which seeks to carry an idea in its pictures and succeeds in part, though the theme is not as clearly and gracefully worked out in some of the scenes as one would wish. The effort, however, is in the right direction and inspires the hope that it will realize more of its possibilities next time.The Strand program this week includes \\"The Inferior Sex,\\" with Mildred Harris Chaplin; one of Max Fleischer's \\"Out of the Ink Well\\" cartoons and Harold Lloyd's \\"High and Dizzy.\\" The photo-dramatic offering at the Rivoli is \\"The Prince Chap,\\" with Thomas Meighan, directed by William de Mille, and B.

The text of this 30-year-old work, without specifically drawing parallels, invites many comparisons of the life of the captured young criminal with the New Testament account of Jesus. But the political developments in Chile in the last couple of decades have made other connections possible, and Mr. Semler, a Chilean director, has enlarged the play's few allusions to repression.

A Melodrama in Darkest Africa"},{"year":"1925","title":"Claire Barrington was bred in old Kentucky, and she owned the Duffy racing stable. Its only real horse was Wildfire, who was running in the International for her fortune, as well as $2,000 belonging to a young scapegrace, the stable boy's $3 and the cook's $6. Claire stood at a window facing the track, when in came John Duffy, the villain, who had no interest in the stable bearing his name except that he did not wish it to win. He had told the negro jockey that if he did not wave a white handkerchief from that very window the rider was to slash Wildfire, which would make the horse pull up. Claire was indomitable. She stood there and let Duffy kiss her. The race started, and when the time came the wily Southern maid plucked the handkerchief from Duffy's pocket and waved it over his shoulder. Chappie Raster, the black jockey, saw the signal, and—well, Wildfire came in by a nose.This is one of the sequences of the film at the Capitol which is named \\"Wildfire,\\" and as an old-fashioned racing melodrama, without much new, it took the audience by storm.The only really new feature of this narrative, which was adapted from the play by George V. Hobart and George Broadhurst, is having the hero. Garrison (Holmes Herbert), declare in gallant fashion that he wants to win Claire and defeat the owner of the Duffy stable. He, of course, does not know that Claire (Aileen Pringle) is the owner of the stable, as he had only just returned from South Africa. You can imagine what happens, for never has a hero been turned down in any racing picture.There is always a fire in such a picture, and they have not missed it here. Poor old Wildfire, who does not seem to know what all the fuss is about, has to be led out of a burning stable, because the villain had ordered his hirelings to set fire to it. The boy who was to ride him appears to be just touched by a thin plank, but according to all reports he is so badly injured that he can't ride Wildfire. So that is why Chappie Raster was sent for. Raster, in the story, also supplies some of the comedy. He arrives for the race with a colored valet, who anticipates Raster's slightest want. Raster wishes a cigarette and the valet goes to Raster's pocket and picks one out. He takes matches from another pocket in his master's coat and then lights the cigarette. The valet flicks the dust from his little black master's shoes. Of course there is no doubt that Raster wins on Wildfire, but it does seem that Wildfire is carrying a pretty good weight. Raster may not be so tall, but he looks rather well fed for a jockey.Holmes Herbert is an all-around sympathetic hero. Miss Pringle has an undeniable charm, especially when she shows her lovely profile, which of course is not infrequently. She does as much as Wildfire to make this picture win with the public.S. L. Rothafel (Roxy) has prefaced this photoplay with an interesting musical prologue in which the figurantes are supposed to be at the races.An amusing comedy with witty titles is the parody on \\"The Iron Horse.\\" It is entitled \\"The Iron Mule,\\" a ramshackle engine and train which the cows can race, and which permits the conductor to hop off his wagon and run up to the engine. It is also equipped so that it can travel with the same speed over water.Those who liked \\"Sporting Life\\" and \\"Little Johnny Jones\\" possibly will find that \\"Wildfire\\" appeals to them. Everybody, however, will get a good, hearty laugh out of \\"The Iron Mule.\\" THE SCREEN","excerpt":"The Hero Loses and Wins."},{"year":"1964","title":"Biog A SAINT WALKS THE FLOORS OF HELL","excerpt":"The Hero of a New Novel Carries a Candle Through the Darkness of Stalin's World; INCOGNITO.

If this animal was born in the French trenches during the war he is about 9 years old, roughly the equivalent of a man of 63. There are not many men of that age who could go through what Rin-Tin-Tin does in this screen adventure. He is like a d'Artagnan of dogs, and he seems to have many a day in this production. He is cunning enough to keep quiet when the villain is searching for him, and he not only evens up scores with this rogue but saves the heroine from going to her death over a cataract.This picture is interesting so long as one is watching Rin-Tin-Tin, and one gathers that he has earned his bones, biscuits and a few chunks of meat. He is also entitled to a few pats for the obedience he displays, for while his performance may be reacting to something far removed from the action of the story, it is evident that Rin-Tin-Tin is extraordinarily sagacious. He seems to enjoy the work, whether it is diving into the river, hiding in a hollow tree trunk or getting into a barrel of water and ducking every time Ben Harley turns his head in Rin-Tin-Tin's direction. These sections of the photoplay are cleverly filmed, but the story itself is not especially lively.Grey Ghost is the name of the dog in this yarn, and his gratitude to a crippled youngster will undoubtedly appeal to all boys and to many girls. One of the sequences that met with the hearty approval of the audience yesterday was when Grey Ghost is in bed with Davey white scowling Ben Harley is looking for the animal. Grey Ghost pops out his head at the propitious moment and hides under the covers when Harley approaches the bed. Davey, himself, enjoyed the proceedings and right under the guns, so to speak, the crippled boy patted the dog.There is also a puppy police dog in this picture. He is known as Rin-Tin-Tin Jr. One would think that Grey Ghost had enough to do without looking after puppies, but at one stage of the production he is called upon to rescue the puppy by wrenching away a piece of wood to which the young animal is chained. And you see the two dogs scampering off, Grey Ghost leading the puppy by holding in his jaws the piece of wood he had torn away.Billy Kept Shaeffer does well as the crippled Davey.

And anyone who can sit through it without smiling nostagically or tapping a foot in three-quarter time would be a cold, tone-deaf customer indeed.Antique or not, this German musical is beautiful to watch, melodic as all get-out and played straight through, thank heaven, in the spirit of fun. Excellently photographed in Eastman color, with a sporting, lavishly costumed cast gliding over some lovely settings, this Carlton-Film Production is by far the most palatable of the recent new German imports at the Yorkville showcase (from Sam Baker Associates).As fashioned into a movie by Fritz Boettger, the scenarist, and Werner Jacobs, who must have directed with a baton, it makes one wonder if the original old warhorse (some time in the Nineteen Twenties, we understand) ever filled a Continental stage so contagiously.The plot? A handsome Polish student (Gerhard Riedmann), leading a pack of young revolutionaries in turn-of-the-century Cracow, yearns for a proud, stone-broke and stunning young countess (Waltraut Haas).

By moving some or all of their manufacturing and assembly operations to Mexico, the argument goes, companies could reduce their costs and become more competitive on a global basis, ultimately helping the economy in the United States.    To opponents of the proposal, any benefits would come at the cost of American jobs. They envision companies closing up in this country and rushing south of the border in search of inexpensive labor.    To George Baker, both sides are missing a key point. Mr. Baker, an economist who is a visiting scholar for the Program on Mexico at the University of California at Los Angeles, believes manufacturing in Mexico is not nearly so inexpensive or cost-efficient as the relatively low wage rate might make it seem.   Mr. Baker argues that looking only at direct labor costs -- the wages paid to workers by employers -- does not take into account many hidden costs of doing business in Mexico. By his accounting, actual labor rates in Mexico could exceed $15 an hour when ancillary costs are factored in, rather than the $1.50 an hour or less that opponents and supporters of the proposed accord presume.    \\"Companies are reacting prematurely in thinking they're going to cut labor costs by three-quarters,\\" Mr. Baker said.    Officials of both countries began formal negotiations last month on the proposed agreement, which would eliminate almost all tariffs and other trade and investment barriers between the two nations. The talks also include Canada, which already has a free-trade agreement with the United States and would become part of a three-way agreement if a deal between Mexico and the United States is concluded. The proposed agreement is strongly supported by the Bush Administration and by President Carlos Salinas de ortari of Mexico.    Mexico is the United States' third-largest trading partner, after Canada and Japan. Many American companies, ranging from auto makers to electronics producers, are considering plants in Mexico if the agreement is completed.    They are interested both in getting better access to the Mexican market and in lowering their costs on products to be exported back to the United States or elsewhere. They would join nearly 1,800 American-owned maquiladora plants already operating in Mexico, employing half a million workers. Maquiladora plants are those owned by foreign companies. They enjoy lower trade barriers.    Gabriel Szekely, an economist at the Center for United States-Mexico Studies at the University of California at San Diego, said the problem of hidden costs in Mexico had long been of concern to American and other foreign companies considering opening plants there.    \\"The question is whether those hidden costs keep companies from moving to Mexico,\\" he said. \\"The evidence is that they do not,\\" Mr. Szekely said, noting the rapid growth in the number of maquiladora and other foreign operations in Mexico.    Still, Mr. Baker said, American companies need to understand that doing business in Mexico may be far more expensive than they expect.    Mr. Baker, who worked for two years for the NCR Corporation in Mexico during the mid-1980's and still consults for American companies with operations there, said moving an operation to Mexico involved considerable financial risk and costs that would be borne directly by the company and that should be considered part of the labor-cost equation, Mr. Baker said. They range from the costs of high employee turnover to inefficient mail service and a substandard telephone system, both of which decrease productivity, he said.    \\"Is it still cheaper to move to Mexico when you factor out social costs and include a risk factor?\\" Mr. Baker asked. \\"I'm trying to get U.S. manufacturing management to ask themselves that question.\\"    Mr. Baker cites the example of a maquiladora plant in Chihuahua City, south of Texas. The plant, Mr. Baker said, claimed an employee turnover rate of 3 percent a month, relatively low at maquiladora plants. But even at that rate, nearly 800 of the company's 2,200 workers leave each year. It costs $333 to recruit and train a new worker, meaning the annual cost of employee turnover is $264,000.    Mr. Baker said there were other hidden costs at the maquiladora plant. The company pays the city for bus service for the workers and provides a subsidized cafeteria and on-site medical and dental care.    But those costs, Mr. Baker said, are only part of the story. \\"When you go into an area like this you have to apply a risk factor to reflect the fragility and inadequacy of the infrastructure,\\" he said. \\"There are always unexpected delays and costs. Your budgets always have a shadow over them. You believe it will cost $100, but it could cost $300.\\"    Economic Scene","excerpt":"The Hidden Costs Of Mexico Plants"},{"year":"1933","title":"Packard, Frank L","excerpt":"The Hidden Door THE HIDDEN DOOR.

Probably not.\\"\\n-- ELIZABETH MARSHALL THOMAS, \\"THE HIDDEN LIFE OF DOGS\\"\\n\\nDo rocks have consciousness? The question is absurd. Of course they do. The assumption that rocks lack an inner life, just because they're on the quiet side, is the kind of crude anthropocentrism that ranks Shakespeare as more \\"sensitive\\" than a pound of shale because he happened to write a few immortal plays. Lodestones have a better sense of direction than we -- maybe because they're more frequently lost in the woods. Quartz is more beautiful than we. Why? Careful grooming. We're all aware that rocks eat sparingly. Is this a lack of consciousness? No. Evolution has simply made them very picky.\\n\\nWhy should we think the lowliest limestone does not feel the same sorrow, exhilaration and fear of hair loss that many of us do? Why should we take granite for granted? Maybe gneiss is nice, and adamant adamant, but will the twain ever meet? It's true that rocks are extremely subtle in the way they express their emotions. Some might say coy. They're also loyal, attentive and nonviolent. (Rocks don't break windows. People do.) How many of us humans really know one another? Look at the hidden life of Rock Hudson. Who knows what lurked in the heart of I. F. Stone? Rocks certainly resist learning human ways. But given Mickey Rourke and Leona Helmsley, why try?\\n\\nI began observing rocks by accident. As a child, naturally, I had pet stones, in particular a pebble named Mr. Smithers, which my father released into the wild after he decided I couldn't care for it properly. In college, my roommate was a 12-pound lump of schist, because nobody else would live with me. We've lost contact, but I couldn't name a more empathetic friend. (When I think of the late-night talks in which I poured out my heart!)\\n\\nMore recently, a neighbor was going away and asked if I'd watch her house. Touring her grounds I noticed two stones on a windowsill -- obviously her pets and probably anxious at their owner's sudden departure. Peaches was a lovely, golden-toned igneous gem, while Tristan was a hefty gray volcanic hunk with knobs and sharp edges. Clearly an alpha rock. I realized that no one had ever investigated what rocks do when left by themselves. I decided to undertake the research myself.\\n\\nHiding at the kitchen door, I would observe them quietly. Luckily, the great slowness of rocks (an evolutionary adaptation) keeps their range relatively narrow. But they can be very territorial indeed. It's rare for one rock to enter the territory of another with impunity. This has to do with demeanor. Over the millennia, rocks have learned that impassivity is the best way to face down a predator. They know the value of standing their ground and certainly wouldn't roll over and accept a pay cut the way I did.\\n\\nAfter a week, I enlarged the group and brought in a couple of strays: a vixenish red stone, which I named Joan Crawford, and a savage, dirty but robust specimen called Hercules. The atmosphere of anxiety on their entrance was palpable. After all, the new rocks had not been domesticated. Ultimately, Peaches and Hercules became excellent companions. Joan Crawford and Tristan were less successful, and I often had to separate them.\\n\\nIn the wild, rocks tend to reside in packs (how else could they survive the Arctic winter?) with a hierarchy determined by size, the dominant rock being the biggest. Feral rocks have more solitary habits, living and feeding alone. City rocks prefer to sit in the park together, or gather for bridge, though it can be hard finding partners.\\n\\nNo one knows what brings rocks into estrus. Seasonal changes? Temperature? The end of the 13-week television season? Pheromones are suspected, but the scent glands of rocks have not been isolated. Stones can sometimes take the most obscene shapes -- probably a form of sexual display. A worker at the Kinsey Institute for Sex Research opined that the sex act itself between rocks is probably rather brief and businesslike, but not un-tender, before she collapsed into either tears or hysterical laughter and hung up on me.\\n\\nInterestingly, rocks flourish with classical music in their environment and have a particular fondness for Schubert lieder. They shrink (paradoxically) from hard rock. Like all of us, they enjoy a warm bath (papaya bath oil is a favorite), and occasionally you might read them an Agatha Christie at bedtime.\\n\\nRocks certainly feel loss, as I discovered on my neighbor's return. I walked Peaches and Tristan over and told my neighbor I was returning her stones, placing them gently in her hand. She asked me what the hell I was talking about. Back home, I sensed the low spirits of Hercules and Joan Crawford and put on some Mozart to cheer them up.\\n\\nWhat do rocks ultimately want? Like all creatures, they want the security of an understanding group, and a good video store in the neighborhood. They want their colleagues at work to stop thinking of them as reclusive weirdos. They want the paperboy to stop throwing the paper in the bushes. They want Mr. Smithers back.\\n\\nI've come to admire these lonely, mysterious objects for their almost Zen calm in the midst of a brash, hardhearted and chaotic world. Millions of years after I'm dust, Joan Crawford and Hercules will still be here, patiently experiencing the universe. Walking around the woods with my stones, jiggling them in my pocket, lying by a stream with my rocks laid out like tiny headstones marking the resting places of small, unmemorable lives, I feel serene. Peaceful. Rocks, unlike my podiatrist, accept me without question for what I am: transient, anxious and human.

Since the mid-1980's analysts have been quarreling over the consequences of the free-spending ways of Americans. Now, Ethan Harris and Charles Steindel have produced what may be the definitive study of low savings and its impact.    Their article in the latest issue of the bank's Quarterly Review acknowledges the joys of eight years unbroken by recession, but they nevertheless believe that the 1980's consumption boom cost the economy dearly. If America had merely maintained the rate of capital accumulation of the earlier postwar decades, the two economists estimate, national output would have been $250 billion larger in 1990. Should the low savings rate of the 1980's persist through the 1990's, they project that the annual loss will reach $750 million.

Thankfully when a noisy one like ''REBUS,'' Robert Rauschenberg's 1955 masterpiece, appears, a relatively unheralded work often provides perspective.    For me, the fanfare and dollar signs that ushered ''Rebus'' into the collection of the MUSEUM OF MODERN ART in July were offset by a chance encounter with Winslow Homer's ''CROQUET PLAYER'' (painted around 1865), at the NATIONAL ACADEMY MUSEUM. The painting's green lawn and sole occupant, a briskly purposeful young woman in a pale coral dress, commanded my attention as I rushed past.    Contrasts abounded. The notepad-size Homer is dwarfed by the 11-foot width of ''Rebus.'' It entered the academy's collection the year after it was painted. ''Rebus'' came to MoMA at the age of 50 at a cost of more than $30 million","excerpt":"the high price was met by selling two other paintings.    Still, common ground exists. The ''Croquet Player'' has a snapshot acuity and asymmetry, intimating an awareness of photography shared by few other artists in the 1860's. ''Rebus'' is daringly blank; its compressed band of magazine images and brushstrokes teeters between Abstract Expressionism and Pop Art. In both works, sports symbolize equality. The optimistic Homer portrays a palpably independent woman playing a new game in which men and women competed as equals. In ''Rebus,'' the first images are a fragment of a campaign poster for a female politician and a photograph of a black runner edging out a white one at a track meet. But it ends with an image of a woman baring her breasts and a shot of the runners in which the white athlete wins. Such interpretations enhance the pertinence of these wonderful American paintings -- the pricey, noisy newcomer and the quietly dynamic 139-year veteran.

As this demonstrates, Kwanzaa is not another field day for Mammon. It is, rather, an opportunity for people of African descent to focus on principles vital to their survival with self-esteem. There are seven of these: unity (Umoja), self-determination (Kujichagulia), collective work and responsibililty (Ujima), cooperative economics (Ujamaa), purpose (Nia), creativity (Kuumba) and faith (Imani).

Many of the songs here are familiar, some hugely so: anyone with even a passing interest in soul music has probably memorized chestnuts like Freda Payne's ''Band of Gold'' and the Supremes' ''Stop! In the Name of Love.'' But these three discs spotlight not the singers but the songwriters: Eddie Holland, his younger brother Brian, and their partner Lamont Dozier, who churned out an astonishing number of Motown classics (and sang a handful, too). The three had a knack for writing buoyant melodies that only hinted at melancholy and lyrics that emphasized a particular sort of heartache: not the feeling of love's absence but the feeling of its overabundance. Part of the fun of this set is hearing that spirit echoed in recordings by such a wide variety of performers, from Dusty Springfield to Michael Jackson to the Band.

The thief used a concrete saw to cut through terrazzo and sidewalk, then carted off the 300-pound, five-pointed pink star bearing Peck's name and the motion-picture logo, both rendered in brass. It was not the first caper involving a star's star, said Johnny Grant, the civic figure known as the mayor of Hollywood: James Stewart's and Kirk Douglas's stars were once lifted from a storage area by a construction worker. And Gene Autry's star, according to legend, once disappeared to the wilds of Iowa. All three stars were quickly replaced, as was Peck's, which was unveiled again yesterday afternoon. Mr. Grant said the thieves had very likely struck sometime before the middle of November, though no one could pin it down. ''It is bizarre,'' said his widow, Véronique Peck.

Using a pendulum as a pictorial motif to stress the importance of time (in progress) and peppering the footage with random shots of Premier Khrushchev bound for New York (last year), some forty-one camera men have supplied a rambling, superficial kind of travelogue that skims all over the U.S.S.R., proudly exhibits a few happy families and a steady flow of Soviet achievements, from sod level to outer space. An extremely unctuous English narrator sternly reminds us of World War II, pleads for peace and underscores the whole thing with Utopian optimism.Utopia needs a compass, not a pendulum—at least from where we sat in the Cameo. The smiling faces and locales flick past so swiftly — farms, classrooms, city crowds, scientific exhibitions, fashion shows, rural landscapes—that the footage seems blithely to be leapfrogging all over the Soviet map. Where, precisely, are we? Furthermore (to quibble about family portraits), a radiant mother who lost both legs as a soldier and a Soviet-Dutch couple with ten children—these people are typical?To us the most interesting shots of all are two fleeting bits. In one, a wizened old Mongolian woman reacts to an outdoor lecture on interplanetary missiles—and a solar-system chart—by removing her corncob pipe and howling with laughter. It's also diverting to see some Moscow streetcar riders gravely scanning newspaper accounts of Mr. Khrushchev's arrival in New York. What are they really thinking (or, for that matter, reading)? After this sweeping, sunny-surfaced \\"Day With the Russians,\\" you still wonder.\\"Concert of Youth\\" is precisely that—a pretty, panoramic musical display by hordes of trade school students, most of it performed outdoors and exuberantly rattling the sound track. As in. so many previous documentaries of this type, the kids are clean-cut and marvelously energetic. As the picture hops from Moscow to Leningrad, Saratov, Kuibishev, Kazan, Tiflis, Kiev and Odessa, the picturesque acts go on and on, with barely a breather. Our favorites are a balalaika band strumming an excerpt from the ballet \\"Spartacus,\\" and a folk number by a mischievous-looking choir of small lads.

Once an honor student with dreams of mainstream success, Mr. Snipes's character sees the heroin overdose of his mother and the complicity of his father in drug trafficking as sealing his fate. Much of the film's power lies in the way the film makers, through Mr. Snipes's psyche, contrast Harlem's revered past before heroin with its misdirected and stifled potential.\\n\\nMuch like the city that surrounds it, Harlem is haunted by its past. Whether that past is as gloriously upbeat as those with selective memories like to remember is, at least to me, as debatable as whether the present is as unalterably gloomy as conventional wisdom believes. If you view Harlem's past as a landscape strode only by giants named Ellington, Hughes and Powell, it's hard, even foolish, to seek contemporary parallels.

This is the sum and substance of a quiet, thoughtful and moving drama from the Gorky Film Studios that, unlike many shrill Soviet-made predecessors, pivots on the power of simple suggestion.With the war itself almost impersonally relegated to the distance, a series of vignettes sketches the war's effects on a handful of apartment neighbors in Moscow.This Artkino release was a major award-winner at the Brussels International Film Festival. Coming from the Russians, it is certainly a major surprise, if not achievement. Even more astonishing is the report that the sensitive scenario was penned by an 18-year-old, Peter Zharov.Mr. Zharov may not have participated in the war that brought his country to its knees, but he knows human beings. And with a fine cast, an alert photographer and two astute directors (Lev Kulijanov and Yakov Siegel), the hardships and agonies of wartime family life, not necessarily Russian, are conveyed with feeling and occasional power.Most of the action occurs in the area of a comfortable middle-class dwelling, and the early pre-war scenes rather leisurely involve three neighboring clans down the hall.One family is dominated by a stern mother, Valentina Telegina, whose strong face dominates every one of her scenes. Next door live a geologist and his lovely wife, who betrays him, to her grief. Then there is the awakening adolescent attraction of a stalwart lad for a pretty would-be actress.What follows, with the 1941 mobilization, is a perceptive, beautifully restrained portrait of a disintegrating war-time residence and its changing occupants. As the camera scours the house and the troubled residents, the co-directors wisely manage to avoid sentimentality by ending most of the emotional scenes at their peaks.Next to the characterizations themselves, the most interesting aspect of the drama is the cryptic understanding behind the camera. The film closes with three superbly staged sequences of home-comings from the front.Miss Telegina, as an aging, distraught mother, is splendid. But the others are almost as effective, especially Yascha Zolnikov and Valdimir Zemlyankin, as her two sons, and Eva Myshkova, as the conscience-stricken wife.One viewer has two minor reservations. The very restraint of the picture makes the over-all effect a bit fragmentary. (A sequel is supposedly forthcoming.) And no suggestion on earth could pack the visual wallop of just one raging, bloody battle scene.Perhaps comparisons are not quite fair, but for culminative power, as we see the cast moving in and out of the house, there remains the competitive screen specter of terrorized confinement in \\"The Diary of Anne Frank.\\"We can still welcome a good, skillful war drama from the Soviet Union, with real people and no nonsense.

Over the years, the ''value'' of frequent flier miles -- determined by dividing the number of miles required for a free flight by the typical cost of that flight -- was around 2 cents each. So if you redeemed 15,000 miles for a free trip, at a time when domestic flights cost more than $300, using the miles was a smart move.

These images etched in the mind clearly attest to Eisenstein's power, of course, but also to Prokofiev's skill. He really did write ''movie music'' that seems inseparable from the impact of moving images. Listening to the brute, crude cannoneers' chant from ''Ivan'' is like watching lumbering and rolling machinery move across a screen until it meets its sweet anthem-marked destiny. The grand finale, with all its percussive extravagance, is a crowd scene compressed into a musical score. Prokofiev's music is strangely limited in its gestures and complexity, but it is weighted with insistent significance, like the limited but exaggerated masque gestures and expressions found in Eisenstein's cinematic faces.

The last-named is a catch-all word for slabs of metal of various shapes carrying either single or treble hooks, or single-hook affairs with lead heads and bodies of feathers, hair or plastic.   The jig - particularly the one with a lead head and a body of some other material - is probably the most versatile lure for both fresh and salt water.

And, indeed, how dramatically and thoughtfully have we seen it illustrated on the screen in such films as the current \\"The Outrage\\" and its classic antecedent, \\"Rashomon\\"?Now the French director André Cayatte has turned to an extreme and novel way of giving it forceful illustration and commercial fascination on the screen. He has told the story of a marriage and its break-up in two separate films, each of them played by the same actors in the same continuity of locales.One is the story of the disaster as recollected by the wife, the other as recollected by the husband. And, just as you would suppose, the wife's recollection of what happened is quite different from that of her spouse.In \\"Anatomy of a Marriage,\\" a tandem title for the films that opened here yesterday at separate theaters, the wife is the strong one in the union as she reconstructs the characteristics of the marriage. She is the one who is trapped by the familiar physical consequence of a recklessly romantic love affair.She is the one who has the foresight and the stamina to urge her spouse to take a course within his compass in the building of his career. And it is she who takes over as breadwinner when he cannot quite carry the load. She goes on to become a successful career woman, thus arousing his fatal jealousy.This exposition of the drama, entitled \\"My Days With Jean-Marc,\\" is being presented in a sweetly feminine atmosphere at the Cinema Rendezvous on West 57th Street","excerpt":"the husband's side, entitled \\"My Nights with Françoise,\\" is being shown in an aura of masculinity at the Little Carnegie, one block up the street. They way the husband recalls it is strikingly—almost shockingly—different from the recollections of his wife. One ticket, incidentally, covers admission to both films ($2.50 on weekdays, $3 on weekends).The husband recalls himself as the noble one in the solution of their embarrassed love affair, and as the cool and sensible director of his legal career. He also remembers that his continuation in the work that he loved in a provincial town had to be abandoned because of the petulant misbehavior of his wife. The way he recalls the progress of her successful career is in a series of dismal recollections of shameful affairs with other men, disregard for his feelings and callous neglect of their child.Obviously, these two pictures, seen (as they must be seen) in an arbitrary continuity with an arbitrary lapse of time between, do not have the unity and cohesion of a single piece of work. They have the characteristic of two separate case histories, recognizable as related only because the people and the places are the same.Nor do they have a rounded and satisfactory dramatic construction as separate films. Each is so completely developed to generate sympathy for one spouse that the other becomes a transgressor with no redeeming qualities to balance the scales. Without the beforehand knowledge that the other side may be seen in the second picture, the viewer of only one might be put out.Yet, with that prefatory knowledge, it is hard to imagine anyone, after seeing one of these pictures, not rushing as fast as he can to the other one, or Mr. Cayatte has developed, in each instance, a most insistent and provocative case that leaves one curious and aggressive, in one way or another, depending upon one's sex.He and his writers have selected significant incidents by which to illustrate the differences of interest of the huband and wife. The husband, for instance, lays much store by the embarrassment of his mother in his life; the wife has little interest or recollection of her mother-in-law. Simple and subtle details that appear differently in the two films give striking clues to the distress and anxieties that weigh heavily in their minds.Also, both films are played shrewdly and with revealing variations. Jacques Charrier as the husband and Marie-José Nat as the wife skillfully portray the characteristics of nobility and selflessness or pettiness and shame. Michel Subor is fascinating as the former lover and still good friend of the wife, and Jacqueline Porel is interesting as the husband's mother. There are other splendid characterizations of Parisian and provincial types, etched and developed in the familiar, crisp Cayatte style.And yet, when you come down to it, the two main characters in these films are distinctly commonplace people, inadequate to responsibility, immature and hardly worth the exceptional attention that is given to them. The range of their disagreement is so wide, indeed, that one feels a third film would now be in order to tell what really happens to them.Incidentally, I would suggest that the order in which to see them is the husband's story first, then the wife's. The latter concludes on a more realistic and logical note of hope.

Two men facing a life together does.\\"Better performances might possibly have given some life to such lines and situations, but under Mr. Nelson's solemn direction, they sound like parodies of real emotions.At one point or another in the film, Mr. Nelson manages to discover and exploit every stereotype of homosexual literature.

As with the performances of the rest of the actors, I couldn't really tell whether his was purposely grotesque or just bad.

By embracing the V-chip, Democrats and Republicans alike can posture as if they care about children without actually having to do anything to improve their cultural lot.

It was another in a series of mishaps that has plagued the ship since she became a cruise vessel in 1980.   In August 1980 a power failure occurred at sea. In May 1981 a boiler problem shut down the ship at sea, and in December 1981 an engine room fire broke out in port, causing cancellation of a New Year's cruise. Just when the Norway will return to service is uncertain. A spokesman for Norwegian Caribbean Lines, which operates the ship, said she might be brought back to Miami earlier than her scheduled return on July 10, but no decision has been made.

The hero, Mark Kessler, is a Long Island clammer, a loner in his mid-30's who has been disowned by his father, a successful plastic surgeon. After Kessler, in self-defense, kills a hunter who terrorizes birds on the marsh preserve, he finds that he is without remorse. Later, smitten by anomie and craving excitement, he begins killing for sport and his own curious sense of self-righteousness, taking five victims in all. As the bodies are discovered, a reward is offered and soon the police and a large group of bounty hunters arrive at Kessler's icebound retreat. With diving equipment and underwater weapons, Kessler descends to the topsy-turvy world beneath the ice of Great South Bay to make his last stand. His cunning and nature's inexorable process - a freezing wind and thin ice - defeat the bounty hunters and put them to rout. And then, by an act of will, Kessler seals his fate and decides who will get the bounty. Mr. Leonard's handling of the climax is superb","excerpt":"the imagery is sharp and brilliant; the writing is always economical and suspenseful. The major characters - Kessler, Ellen Smith, a girl of 14 whom he treats as a daughter, and her father, who is killed by Kessler for turning Ellen into a prostitute - are well- rounded and believable, and their behavior effortlessly and naturally propels the plot along its harrowing course.

Inspired by people in tabloid newspaper stories, these characters may initially strike us as unlikely eccentrics, trapped in banal, suburban lives, but as reimagined by the director and his collaborators, they gradually emerge as ''people like us'' -people whose sympathetic depiction attests to a new feeling of acceptance, even a sense of belonging, on Mr. Byrne's own part.

Opera seemed creatively extinct, appealing to a comfortably bourgeois audience that neither knew nor wanted to know of the radical innovations that were transforming the other arts.  There were exceptions to this generalization, of course, both in the composition of an occasional important new opera and some strikingly original productions of the classics. But, for the most part, the avant-garde expressed itself in painting, theater, performance art, dance, even rock-and-roll more readily than in dear, dead old opera.   By and large, opera buffs couldn't have cared less. They grew to like things the way they were, happily savoring new singers as they came along, comparing performances, and having what they already knew confirmed, year in and year out.   Now, the avant-garde and the opera would appear to have taken a renewed interest in each other. There is danger in such a sudden revitalization, however. The avant-gardists, lacking a sense of opera's traditions and essence, may carelessly destroy it in the pursuit of novelties.

W. de Klerk moved today to smash the legal bedrock of apartheid by announcing that he would scrap the remaining laws on which South Africa's ideology of racial discrimination has long rested.    In a speech opening the 1991 session of Parliament, Mr. de Klerk said legislation would soon be introduced to repeal the Land Acts of 1913 and 1936, which reserved most of the country's land for the white minority, the Group Areas Act of 1966, and the Black Communities Act of 1984, which entrenched the separate status of black townships.    In appealing for the revocation of racial laws, now considered to be virtually certain, Mr. de Klerk went beyond what had been expected by also mentioning the Population Registration Act, which classifies all South Africans into four racial groups: blacks, whites, people of mixed race and Asians. Reversing an earlier Government position, he said that the law, entrenched in the nation's Constitution, would, like the others, be soon eliminated.  Transitional Steps Proposed     He said this could be done through the enactment of what he described as \\"temporary, transitional measures\\" needed to maintain the present Constitution until a new one can be negotiated and drafted.    \\"Should Parliament adopt the Government's proposals,\\" Mr. de Klerk said, \\"the South African statute book will be devoid, within months, of the remnants of racially discriminatory legislation which have become known as the cornerstones of apartheid.\\"  [ Excerpts from the speech, page 7. ]   In Washington, the State Department welcomed the proposals as \\"dramatic and far-reaching,\\" but noted that all political prisoners had yet to be released, as required under United States laws governing the lifting of sanctions. Further Momentum     The speech by Mr. de Klerk today lent further momentum to a process that the President began at the opening of Parliament last year, when the African National Congress and other anti-apartheid organizations were legalized and Mr. de Klerk announced his Government's intention to release the congress's leader, Nelson Mandela. Mr. Mandela walked out of a prison farm nine days later.    \\"In the short span of a single year,\\" Mr. de Klerk said today, \\"substantial progress was made. The Government is determined to build on the foundations laid purposefully, efficiently and with due speed.    \\"South Africa cannot allow or permit the dynamic process of reform to slow down,\\" he told Parliament.    As he spoke, the African National Congress, conducted mass marches in Cape Town, Johannesburg, Pretoria and some other cities to put pressure on the Government in advance of looming but as yet undefined Constitutinal talks. The anti-apartheid group also sought to underscore the reality that blacks remain excluded from Parliament and from institutional political life.    In Cape Town, Walter Sisulu, a senior leader of the congress, addressed a crowd of perhaps 15,000 people who had gathered outside City Hall.  Insists on Right to Vote     \\"We still do not have the vote, and this is what our people want today,\\" Mr. Sisulu said. He added that the scrapping of the apartheid laws must be followed by \\"measures to retrieve the damage they have done.\\"    Mr. de Klerk reiterated his opposition to an elected constituent assembly to draft a new constitution and an interim government, something that the African National Congress has demanded.    \\"The idea that the present, legally constituted Government should relinquish its powers and simply hand over its responsibilities to some or other temporary regime cannot be considered in a sovereign, independent state,\\" Mr. de Klerk said.    But he suggested that the Government might share some of its authority with the congress and with other groups outside the parliamentary process, once the transition to nonracial democracy was under way.    \\"Consideration may be given to certain transitional arrangements on the various legislative and executive levels to give the leaders of the negotiating parties a voice in the formulation of important policy decisions,\\" Mr. de Klerk said.   Entrenched Inequality     While the elimination of the remaining racial laws will likely signal the demise of apartheid as a legal system, the disparities, inequality and hostility that have divided black and white South Africans under the apartheid system are unlikely to be erased as categorically.    Though public facilities like libraries and community swimming pools were legally integrated in October, many of these remain unused by blacks. Similar recent laws enabling some formerly white schools to accept black pupils when more than 72 per cent of the parents approved have so far to led the integration of 205 schools, a small number nationwide, with generally few black children admitted at each school.   Once the laws cited today are repealed, a black South African will legally be able to live in a white neighborhood and buy land previously set aside for whites. In practice, though, few blacks can afford it. The Government has not said that it will return land confiscated from dispossessed blacks, with little or no compensation, in the last four decades.    Some lingering resistance to change was evident in Parliament, where legislators of the right-wing Conservative Party, the official opposition, angrily walked out during Mr. de Klerk's hourlong speech. The Conservative Party leader, Andries P. Treurnicht, said later that Mr. de Klerk's plans to scrap the apartheid laws struck at the roots of white community life.    \\"It is surprising that South Africa now has the only leader in the Western world who is negotiating himself, his party and his people out of power,\\" Mr. Treurnicht said.  White Liberals Gratified     However, Zach de Beer, the leader of the liberal Democratic Party, observed that President de Klerk had promised to repeal the Group Areas and Land Acts. But, Dr. de Beer said, \\"most of us did not expect that the Population Registration Act would go this year, and we're pleased.\\"    The Government had said that the Population Registration Act would have to remain in force until a new constitution extending political rights to the black majority was adopted.    But President de Klerk said today that \\"following investigation, it would, in fact, appear possible to repeal this act, provided that this is accompanied by the adoption of temporary transitional measures toward the acceptance of a new constitution.\\"    The total elimination of existing racial distinctions would throw into question the legitimacy of Parliament, which now has separate chambers for white, mixed-race and Asian legislators, though none for blacks. Mr. de Klerk was proposing, among other things, keeping Parliament, and by extension his Government, intact through temporary legal provisions in place of the Population Registration Act.    Gerrit N. Viljoen, the Minister for Constitutional Development, told foreign journalists that the racial classification of all new babies or immigrants would end the day the Population Registration Act was repealed. He suggested that the racial classification of other South Africans, while still on the registration books, would quickly fall into disuse.   The President is not expected to have difficulty enacting his proposed reforms because his National Party and the liberal Democratic Party control close to three-quarters of the seats in the white House of Assembly. The leaders of the Democratic Party have consistently sought discussions with the nation's black majority, and in recent years, Mr. de Klerk has convinced many in his own party that such dialogue is inevitable.  End of Emergency Rule     Since he committed himself and his Government to fundamental change, Mr. de Klerk has repealed the Separate Amenities Act, which let municipalities reserve public services for whites, has opened hospitals to all races, among other changes, and has ended a national state of rule by emergency decree, which restricted political activity.    Foreign Minister Roelof F. Botha said that the measures announced today were not aimed at eliminating the economic and other sanctions imposed by Western nations, including the United States.    \\"What is happening today is confirming President de Klerk's clear statement that the process toward the dismantling of apartheid and fundamental change in South Africa is irreversible,\\" Mr. Botha said.  Tutu Now Doubts Sanctions     The Anglican Archbishop, Desmond M. Tutu, who attended the African National Congress march, told reporters there that President de Klerk's speech made it hard to dispute his seriousness about dismantling apartheid.    \\"We are getting very near to where it will be irreversible,\\" said Archbishop Tutu, a prominent proponent of economic sanctions. \\"It is going to be very difficult for us to continue to ask for sanctions.\\"   The Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act enacted by the United States Congress in 1986 provided that sanctions would end once the Pretoria Government released Nelson Mandela and other political prisoners, repealed rule by decree, legalized banned political parties and unfettered political activity, repealed the Group Areas and Population Registration Acts, and agreed to enter into good-faith negotiations with representatives of the black majority.    It further permits the President to suspend or modify sanctions once three of the last four conditions were achieved.    The President told Parliament that the constitutional reform he envisionedd had to be accompanied by economic growth to give blacks real equality. \\"Until the pressing problems of poverty and unemployment are alleviated,\\" he said, \\"constitutional models will be of little avail to us.\\"               --------------------          U.S. Praise and Pressure     WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State Department spokeswoman, Margaret D.

They laughed heartily at some of the strange doings of the characters, the merriment being unrestrained when the hungry heroine was perceived devouring a sandwich as she danced with Gordon Kent, who was known to be worth $20,000,000. It was the first mouthful Norma Selbee had eaten since the previous afternoon, for she was not even worth ten cents.Kent is an impulsive individual, both in business and love. The first night he encounters Norma he proposes to her and then insists on their getting married within the hour. Norma, be it known, is not a fortune hunter, but Kent, played by Jack Holt, appeals to her. Hence the girl who is first seen doing her own ironing and longing for a meal, becomes Mrs. Gordon Kent. She is burdened with enormous diamond earrings and bracelets and apparently her only complaint is that her husband is too devoted to her. This sad state of affairs ends in her running away with Lawrence Marchmont, an old friend, who is more interested in Norma's jewelry than in her.Kent, after looking up their records, decides to punish them by insisting that they must not part. He has discovered that Marchmont is a swindler wanted by the police of three countries and that Norma is apparently a bigamist, inasmuch as she is not divorced, as she believed, from her first husband, Jim Selbee.Hence, so far as Norma is concerned, she has many months in which to repent leaving her husband. Kent bangs his fist into his hand and one knows that he is still in love with Norma. And Norma is supposed to atone eventually for deserting her husband for Marchmont by warning him of a blackmail plot, which Jim Selbee, her husband, who turns up suddenly, is eager to carry out. Matters are finally settled to the satisfaction of Kent and Norma, for Selbee is killed and Marchmont is jailed as his murderer.It is presumed that Norma has been taught a lesson and will think twice before leaving her husband again for some other man.The dialogue in this film, which is based on a story by Rex Beach, is somewhat crude and the acting is not much better than the story, except possibly that of Sidney Toler, who officiates as Kent's wise friend, William Southern. Mary Astor impersonates Norma. Kitty Kelly affords some amusement as Norma's sympathetic chum. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"The Impulsive Millionaire.

But the parent of United Airlines, the nation's second-largest airline, reported a healthy profit, helped a lot by its lucrative Pacific routes.   Following are details of the companies' results:  UAL     The UAL Corporation, parent of United, earned $106.1 million, or $4.87 a share, down 4.3 percent from $110.9 million, or $5.11 a share, a year earlier. Besides the Pacific routes, United's results were buoyed by aircraft sales of $93 million, compared with only $46 million the year before. Revenue rose 15.1 percent, to $2.97 billion from $2.58 billion. UAL stock closed at $96 yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, down 87.5 cents. Delta Air Lines     Delta Air Lines reported a loss of $51 million, compared with a profit of $133.1 million, or $2.38 a share, a year earlier. It was Delta's first loss in a September quarter since 1982. \\"If these trends continue, the company expects to report a loss for the full calendar year,\\" said Thomas Roeck, the airline's chief financial officer. Revenue rose 1.8 percent, to $2.21 billion from $2.17 billion.    Passenger revenue at Delta grew only 2 percent, reflecting a soft economy and strong competition from Eastern Airlines in the Southeast. Eastern has been struggling to rebound from a strike and has cut fares on many routes, forcing Delta to match them. \\"Eastern is a black hole that sucks the fares down,\\" said Kevin Murphy, an analyst with Morgan Stanley.    Delta, following the lead of other airlines, said yesterday that it would raise fares 5.8 percent","excerpt":"the increase applies to tickets bought on or after Oct. 31. Delta's stock closed yesterday in Big Board trading at $61.75, down $3.125.  USAir     USAir Group lost $120.3 million, compared with a loss of $77.7 million a year earlier. Edwin I. Colodny, chairman of USAir, cited not only higher fuel costs but also a one-time depreciation charge of $36 million for 24 older, less fuel-efficient jets that are being phased out of service. Still, despite the sluggish economy, USAir's passenger traffic rose 6 percent. USAir stock closed at $16.625, down 62.5 cents. in Big Board trading. Revenue rose 7.2 percent, to $1.64 billion from $1.53 billion.    Fuel prices have doubled since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2, although they have dropped in the last week, from about $1.20 to $1 a gallon.    But fuel costs did not surge until the middle of the last quarter. Many industry analysts see even poorer results for the fourth quarter. Mr. Murphy is predicting a $120 million loss for United in that quarter.   The airlines attribute the higher fuel costs partly to what they say is price gouging by the oil companies. \\"We think the oil companies have passed on disproportionate higher costs to the airlines as compared to people who buy gasoline for their cars,\\" said Robert Aaronson, president of the Air Transport Association, the industry trade group.

And the monstrous consequences of the assassinations which occurred in that little Bosnian town on June 28, 1914, have tended somewhat to obscure the personal tragedy of the ill-starred victims of that compound deed. So it is that the new French film, \\"Mayerling to Sarajevo,\\" which opened last night at the Little Carnegie, resurrects from a dim and dusty past the pitiful, romantic story of two of the most pathetic minor figures in history, the Archduke Francis Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary and his morganatic wife, Sophie Chotek. And it does so with admirable restraint, tender affection and essential fidelity.Romantic historians and dramatists have been inclined to make much more of the comparable tragic love story of Francis Ferdinand's cousin, Archduke Rudolph, and the beautiful Marie Vetsera. And that is reasonable, for the prior \\"affaire célèbre,\\" which shook the Habsburg dynasty, possessed the more sensational elements of drama. Rudolph and his unaccepted mistress presumably put an end to their own lives rather than endure any longer the reaction to their liberal ideas and the crucifying opposition of court intriguers. Francis Ferdinand, who succeeded Rudolph as heir to the Habsburg throne, was permitted to marry the woman of his choice, with certain provisional limitations, and eventually was assassinated with her, a victim of cruel and ironic fate.Thus the film, \\"Mayerling to Sarajevo,\\" which inevitably must bear comparison with the haunting, poetic \\"Mayerling\\" of three years ago, is less a romantic tragedy of classic proportions, more a piteous account of the propulsion of two hapless lovers to a portentous doom. They are mere pawns in a terrible game, destroyed by destiny and not by their own devices. As a consequence, the picture leaves one with no sense of fulfillment or poetic exaltation such as was compelled by \\"Mayerling\\"","excerpt":"the inexorable climax concludes a sad, futile affair. The only satisfaction is that the two lovers die together heroically.Considering the fact that this picture was made in France during the tense months of last Winter, it has been done with surprising effectiveness. True, it hits tedious stretches, there is too much emphasis upon court details and the direction of Max Ophuls is occasionally listless or ponderous. But Edwige Feuillere creates an altogether lovely and sensitive Countess Sophie, John Lodge plays Francis Ferdinand with a slightly monotonous but compelling masculinity and other members of the cast are uniformly good. And the final sequence—the fateful episode of Sarajevo—is enacted with amazing vividness. Here, at last, on the screen is one of history's most tragic events—the beginning, not the end, of a terrible drama. This is the concentrated point of the entire film.

The Kremerata Musica is the reincarnation of the Lockenhaus Festival, founded by Mr. Kremer in 1981.

Whether its distinction is due to the contained acoustical environment it is used to, to its accustomed role as vocal accompanist or simply to the sensibilities of its director, James Levine, there is a weightlessness to the sound, an extraordinary fineness and a marked lack of heft from its deeper elements.   In the opening tutti of Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 12 on Saturday night, the violinists seemed amazed, even disoriented, by the resonance of Carnegie Hall. It was playing of uncommon refinement that nevertheless came out in a dazzling blur of sound.

From the front door right down to the pencil holders, the look is flawless. It's no accident. As any decorator knows, the office is one place where the proverbial handwriting really is on the wall.    \\"Our office reflects what we're all about,\\" says Keith Irvine, a partner at Irvine & Fleming, a Manhattan-based decorating company. \\"It's where we sell the whole game.\\"   For a prospective client, a decorator's office is a barometer of the firm's taste and flair. \\"If someone doesn't like my office, then they're not going to like my work,\\" says Bunny Williams, who began her own business on the parlor floor of a Manhattan brownstone two years ago after 22 years as a decorator at Parish-Hadley. This is why designers usually insist on having initial meetings at their office rather than at the site in need of decorating. \\"It's the best way to get to know each other before confronting the nuts and bolts of a job,\\" says Vicente Wolf, another Manhattan decorator. \\"It's also important that clients see we don't just work out of a back room, but that we have a very professional setup. That's why I always give them a tour of the whole office right down to where the billing is done. Decorating is all about teamwork.\\"   The three offices shown here are newly decorated and the work of seasoned decorators. Prospective clients can not only pick up the overall spirit, but also specific decorating ideas. A visit to Irvine & Fleming's offices, for example -- 4,000 square feet in a modern high-rise -- shows what clever architectural mill work can do to transform bland modern space. Classical columns and archways, moldings and baseboards fashioned from both wood and fiberglass and painted with elaborate glazes were all newly added by the decorators. The office is an example of how a homey atmosphere can be created from scratch.   \\"We've purposely designed a strong architectural background,\\" Irvine says. \\"In this economy people have to first put their money into what lasts. So we recommend to clients that good architecture and correct proportions should come before the trimmings.\\"   \\"Certainly a sense of luxury has to continue,\\" Irvine adds, \\"but in more subtle dollops.\\" All the signatures of Irvine & Fleming's relaxed English country-house look are in view: the upholstery is the plushest down, the curtains Regency in style. There are faded chintzes, tiny silhouettes, 18th-century Chinese wallpaper and an assortment of English antiques. There is also a marble floor in the entrance. \\"When people walk down the hall it sounds as though we're in a real house,\\" says Tom Fleming, another partner. THE FLOORS IN VICENTE WOLF'S Conference room are painted a dead white. \\"I know it's not practical,\\" he says, \\"but they're scrubbed every day.\\" Unlike Irvine and Fleming, who created a look that is antithetical to their original space, Wolf has taken an old sewing factory and left reminders of its industrial past: the old windows are intact, the radiators, beams and sprinkler system are exposed. All the walls are painted white. In the main room, a white leather tablecloth covers a round conference table. \\"My office is a canvas, a purposely neutral space that allows the jobs we're working on to come to life,\\" Wolf says. It's also a reflection of the atmospheres Wolf creates, where antiques are sparingly placed in spare settings. \\"Obviously I tell people my jobs don't always look like this,\\" he says. \\"The office is simply a stage set.\\" BUNNY WILLIAMS CONSIDERS HER OFFICE A place where she can teach as well as show off her style. \\"The things in these rooms show what can be done,\\" she says. \\"It's a vehicle for ideas.\\" The faux marbre fireplace mantel in her conference room, for example, illustrates what beautiful finishes can do to a plain mantel. Regency-style hanging shelves display tiles and marble samples. A telephone table is actually a good storage tip -- it has extra-deep drawers that hold the decorator's catalogues.   Williams's private office looks like a cozy drawing room. The walls are a teal blue mottled wallpaper -- \\"a cheaper solution than paint when you have old walls,\\" she says. The curtains have a sheered valance made of inexpensive Korean silk. \\"Curtains don't have to be overdone and cost the earth,\\" Williams says. A pair of chairs in the window are English Esthetic Movement, still an affordable antique. \\"I want people to see that I'm about quality and atmosphere,\\" she says. \\"And whoever comes to my office should be as comfortable as if they were in my own living room.\\" Design","excerpt":"THE INNER SANCTUM"},{"year":"1927","title":"Wickes, F G, Inner World of Childhood CHILD PSYCHOLOGY","excerpt":"THE INNER WORLD OF CHILDHOOD.

It is difficult to believe that anyone in American dance does not know who Martha Hill is, but since she is often on juries that make awards to others, it is only fitting that time be taken out, again, to honor her own achievements.   Inextricably, these accomplishments are linked to four major institutions. She joined the fledgling dance department at New York University in 1930 as a teacher, where she became its director, developing the department and extending it into a graduate degree program, remaining there until 1951. She was the founder and codirector of the famed summer Bennington School of the Dance and the Bennington Festivals at Bennington College (where she was also its first dance department chairman in the regular academic year) from 1934 to 1942.   In 1948, she re-established the Bennington idea at Connecticut College, initially with New York University's co-sponsorship, in a new summer school of dance and the American Dance Festival - now at Duke University in Durham, N.C. Finally, she established the first dance department at the Juilliard School in 1951 and has been the Dance Division's director since.

Ron Wildermuth of the Navy sat in his office at United States Central Command headquarters in Tampa, Fla., and sent a classified message flashing across military computers on three continents.   As Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf's chief aide for public affairs, Captain Wildermuth had spent days drafting the message, a 10-page document known as Annex Foxtrot, which laid out a blueprint for the operation's public information policy. The movement of troops, weapons and materiel was to become the largest since the humiliating -- and televised -- Vietnam War defeat. And in the officer's mind, one point bore repetition.   \\"News media representatives,\\" he wrote, \\"will be escorted at all times. Repeat, at all times.\\"   The drafting of Annex Foxtrot was one step in a long march of decisions that, by war's end, left the Government with a dramatically changed policy on press coverage of military operations.    The gulf war marked this century's first major conflict where the policy was to confine reporters to escorted pools that sharply curtailed when and how they could talk to troops. And within months, Americans were receiving news accompanied by words that had not been connected with combat accounts for nearly 50 years: \\"Reports reviewed by military censors.\\"    The policy began with a decision by the Administration's most senior officials, including President Bush, to manage the information flow in a way that supported the operation's political goals and avoided the perceived mistakes of Vietnam.   But the elaboration of this approach took place incrementally, with the main oversight responsibility delegated to Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, whose press policy during the Panama invasion had been faulted by an official Pentagon inquiry for its \\"excessive concern for secrecy.\\"    And Mr. Cheney, in turn, left many decisions in the hands of field commanders, many of whom had left Vietnam deeply suspicious of reporters, who were relatively free to cover American forces in action.    While critics of the policy have argued that the restrictions on independent reporting were intended to produce a sanitized view of the war, top officials have said they were necessary to prevent security lapses in a new era of instant communications.   \\"It isn't like World War II, when George Patton would sit around in his tent with six or seven reporters and muse,\\" with the results \\"transcribed and reviewed\\" for eventual release, said Gen. Colin L. Powell, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.   If a commander \\"in Desert Shield sat around in his tent and mused with a few CNN guys and pool guys and other guys, it's in 105 capitals a minute later,\\" General Powell said. Cheney's Central Role    Dozens of interviews with civilian and military officials and a review of major planning documents disclose the following points:    *The White House, while delegating most decisions to Mr. Cheney, closely monitored some details. Mr. Bush watched virtually every briefing, while his aides urged that certain officers be swept from television screens and promoted Lieut. Gen. Thomas W. Kelly as a briefer with star potential. The Pentagon, once it realized the power of televised briefings, set up daily rehearsal sessions for General Kelly, and happened onto a system for learning the questions that reporters would throw at him.   *The military, assuming that correspondents from the small-town press would write sympathetic articles, provided free transportation to Saudi Arabia and special access to servicemen and women from their areas. Aides also analyzed articles written by other reporters to determine their interests and to screen out interview requests from those likely to focus on mistakes by the military.   *Pentagon officials decided early in the operation to radically change the purpose of press pools, taking what had been set up as a temporary device to get reporters to a combat zone and turning it into the sole means of combat coverage. Despite that decision, Mr. Cheney's spokesman, Pete Williams, held a series of autumn meetings with news executives that encouraged them to believe that traditional independent reporting would follow.   *White House officials, in the face of criticism, wavered at one point but dropped the idea of easing press restrictions after a \\"Saturday Night Live\\" sketch lampooning the press convinced them and the President that the public was on their side.   Striding into his press secretary's office during an interview about war coverage last month, Mr. Bush stamped the policy with his own seal of approval. \\"I think that the American people stand behind us,\\" he said. \\"I think they felt they got a lot of information about this war.\\"   Public opinion polls have shown overwhelming majorities backing the military over the press.   In separate interviews, Mr. Cheney and John H. Sununu, the White House chief of staff, called the policy a model for the future. The only time information was withheld, Mr. Sununu said, was when it would compromise military security. \\"There was never an effort not to give information out,\\" he said. \\"There was never an effort not to focus on things.\\"   And Mr. Cheney, the policy's chief architect, said, \\"there was better coverage, more extensive coverage, more elaborate coverage, greater knowledge on the part of the American people, about this war, as it unfolded, than any other war in history.\\" But few journalists agree.   \\"I'm not sure the public's interest is served by seeing what seems to have been such a painless war, when 50,000 to 100,000 people may have died on the other side,\\" said Ted Koppel, host of the ABC News program \\"Nightline.\\"    \\"Obviously this was done so they could maintain the closest possible control over public opinion, to increase support for the war.\\"  Guiding Principles  No Accidents In This Campaign    Early in the troop buildup, the President and the group of top advisers discussed past military endeavors in which they felt press policy was handled poorly, including Vietnam, Panama and the May 1975 seizure of the American merchant ship Mayaguez off Cambodia. The group instructed Mr. Cheney, one of its members, to take charge.    \\"Nobody dwelled on it,\\" one official at the meeting said. \\"The sense was, 'Set it up over there, pay attention to it -- don't have things happen by accident, take control of it.' \\"    In an interview, Mr. Cheney said he was guided by two overarching principles. One was that military needs had to take precedence over journalistic rights, and so the \\"lore\\" of past practice needed to be disregarded.   Another was to guard Government credibility. \\"There was ample precedent that one of the really great ways to screw up an operation -- certainly was one of the lessons learned in Southeast Asia -- is don't get out there making claims you can't back up,\\" Mr. Cheney said.   Indeed, one of the reasons that the Government lost public support for the conflict in Vietnam was the much-discussed credibility gap, attributed to the Johnson Administration's failure to be candid with the public about its policy.   Mistakes of Vietnam    President Lyndon B. Johnson for a time tried to hide the extent of the American military buildup and repeatedly cast an optimistic gloss on the military effort and on the ability of the South Vietnamese to govern in the face of on-the-scene reporting showing the opposite.    The military had been thinking about the press long before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. \\"One thing Vietnam did to us is nobody says, 'Oh, don't worry about public affairs,' \\" said retired Maj. Gen. Winant Sidle, who served as the chief military spokesman there.   While some commanders had simply left the press behind, as was the case in Grenada and Panama, a more sophisticated approach had also been developing. \\"Seek out the media and try to bring them in to write stories and produce television shows or clips in support of the organization's goals,\\" a War College textbook suggests. Many Air Force generals receive a course in briefing style, during which their presentations are videotaped and critiqued.   While Mr. Cheney and other leaders were explicit in saying they were shaped by the lessons of Vietnam, General Powell said, \\"I never gave it the first thought.\\"   Calling Vietnam references \\"a cheap shot,\\" General Powell said that whenever reporters were unhappy, \\"you take out your little branding iron with the 'V' and heat it up and burn it into our foreheads.\\"    Emphasizing that he was just a captain in Vietnam, General Powell said that his experiences as a top commander or national security adviser during the 1983 bombing of the United States Marines barracks in Beirut and in Grenada and Panama taught him much more about \\"how we had to handle the information.\\"   General Powell did say that one of his top priorities in training commanders has been to make \\"them understand the proper role of media.\\" While some have pointed to such training to argue that the military has grown more skilled at manipulating the press, General Powell said, \\"I spin it differently.\\"   \\"Sure, you want to see if you can get the press to support the goals, but that's not why you work with the press,\\" he said. \\"You work with the press because it is your obligation.\\" Correspondents' Imperative    When he arrived in Saudi Arabia, Captain Wildermuth, the Schwarzkopf aide, compiled a list of ground rules that journalists were required to sign in exchange for credentials. From the correspondents' standpoint, the trouble began with these words: \\"You MUST remain with your military escort at all times.\\"   Captain Wildermuth said he added that provision on his own. \\"You needed an escort to provide a liaison with the units,\\" he said. \\"That military guy speaks military. It's just smart.\\" For that reason, he said, escorts were a standard part of press pools.   But critics say this decision fundamentally changed coverage of military operations, by transforming escorts into a permanent part of the news-gathering process.   Fred S. Hoffman, a former Pentagon spokesman who helped design the pool system in the mid-1980's, said the new rule was \\"far more restrictive than anything we'd ever tried to do.\\"   Captain Wildermuth said he did not directly consult General Schwarzkopf about the rules. But, he added, he was careful to make them reflect the commander's general philosophy. Rules at Work  Better Treatment for Local Press    Without the independent movement they had in Vietnam, reporters covering the buildup last fall said they were rarely able to talk to the troops. The escorted visits were conducted infrequently and typically lasted one night.   Public affairs officials said the presence of reporters would distract units from their war preparations.   But under the military's Hometown News Program, about 960 journalists from generally small papers and television stations near units' home bases, along with a handful from larger organizations including The New York Times, flew to Saudi Arabia free on military aircraft. They spent up to four nights in the field with their hometown units.   Why didn't those reporters pose a problem?   \\"There was just a safer feeling,\\" said Lieut. Col Michael Cox of the Air Force, who ran the program. \\"If they know that they're getting a free ride and they can't afford the $2,000 ticket, there's probably going to be a tendency to say, 'We'll do good stuff here.' \\"   On the one occasion the Pentagon suggested giving the major news organizations more time in the field, General Schwarzkopf vetoed the suggestion. That was in October, after planners sent to Saudi Arabia by Mr. Williams, Mr. Cheney's spokesman, recommended sending four six-member pools to the front lines and treating reporters as \\"de facto members of the units.\\" The first pools were not in place until Jan. 14, three days before the start of the air war.   While lack of access to troops brought one set of reporters' complaints, the conduct of escorts brought another. The escorts helped choose whom reporters could talk to. Some hovered over interviews and others stepped in front of cameras to interrupt ones they did not like.    Mr. Williams has described such incidents as isolated, involving inexperienced officers. \\"That's not the way it's supposed to work,\\" he told a Congressional committee in February.   But others argue that leaders set a restrictive tone by design. After this newspaper quoted a private criticizing President Bush, General Schwarzkopf called the enlisted man's commanding general, asking for an explanation.    Aides to General Schwarzkopf said they screened requests for interviews by researching the reporter's past articles \\"to be aware of what the person's interests were,\\" as one said, adding that such research is standard peacetime procedure.    Stories about angry commanders traveled quickly, and Mr. Hoffman, the former Pentagon spokesman whom Mr. Williams consulted during the run-up to the war, said escorts understood that they risked being called to task for negative stories.    \\"If it's not what they intended,\\" Mr. Hoffman said \\"there was ample time to straighten out the situation.\\" Pool Coverage  Some Assumptions and the Deception    The autumn skirmishes between reporters and escorts were followed by perhaps the most important information-policy decision of the war: the order to limit battle coverage to officially sanctioned pools.   \\"There's a huge gaggle of reporters out there, and the press has absolutely no capacity to police itself,\\" Mr. Cheney said in the interview. \\"There was no way we were ever going to put 100 percent of the reporters who wanted to go cover the war out with the troops.\\"    But the decision to confine reporting to official pools represented a departure not only from Vietnam, but also from World War II, where reporters had generally been given wide access to combat action and to commanders, with their dispatches reviewed by military censors for security violations.   It was also a departure from the pool system conceived after the 1983 invasion of Grenada, which led to reporters' protests at being left behind. Pool members were to accompany troops into combat on a moment's notice, sharing their reports, then quickly dissolving as soon as other reporters could arrive. Then, independent, or \\"unilateral\\" coverage would follow.    But Mr. Cheney scrapped the system in Panama by delaying the pool's departure when United States forces invaded in 1989. He later said he feared security breaches","excerpt":"the inquiry commissioned by the Pentagon found that fear \\"excessive.\\"  'Don't Worry,' Spokesman Says     A group of news executives that met with Mr. Williams in the fall to discuss visas say he reassured them that any pool coverage of actual combat would be short-lived.   \\"It was, 'Don't worry about it, boys, we understand your concerns -- we're going to have unilateral coverage,' \\" said George Watson, Washington bureau chief of ABC News.   But by his own account, Mr. Williams left the last of those meetings, on Nov. 28, and briefed Mr. Cheney and General Powell on precisely the opposite approach -- a plan to make pools the sole means of combat coverage, which they accepted. On Dec. 14, Mr. Williams made that plan public.    \\"Obviously we didn't make it as clear as we should have,\\" Mr. Williams said of the news executives' angry reaction. \\"But fully a month before the war started, we submitted a draft to them.\\"   After making only minor modifications, he issued a final order imposing pools on Jan. 15, less than 48 hours before the start of the air war.   The journalists involved in the meetings have been accused by colleagues -- and some have accused themselves -- of failing to exercise sufficient vigilance.   But Mr. Williams says that while the journalists may have felt they were in a negotiation, he never considered them equal partners.   \\"This was not a decision made by a committee,\\" he said. \\"They bear no responsibility for the decision.\\" Long Series of Military Decisions Led to Gulf War News Censorship"},{"year":"2006","title":"Deutsche Lufthansa said it would pay $85 million to settle 80 class-action lawsuits in the United States in a price-fixing inquiry involving its air cargo unit.

Indeed, listeners are likely to be as impressed by Mr. Husa's vivid skills as they are depressed by his melancholy message. The difficult solo part, which Mr. Dicterow plays with admirable elegance and utter fearlessness, becomes a lonely if voluble protagonist. At the start, an agitated solo leaps back and forth across the instrument's range. High, sustained violin tones join from the orchestra sections by ones and twos. This underpinning, desolate and ominous, grows in weight and color but offers little solace to the insistently unhappy solo writing.

But as an apparent parable set in a peaceful Grecian backwash of World War II it is almost metaphysically obscure as allegory, even though its characterizations and intentions are as honest as its impressively authentic pastoral backgrounds.Using the Dodecanese island of Cos, Werner Herzog, who at 26 is the youngest contributor to the festival, proves to be strikingly effective as a director if not altogether convincing as an allegorist. These are indeed mere placid signs of life he has captured in a dozing microcosm of whitewashed houses, lapping waves on a pebbled shore, a moldering bastion, broken ancient Greek statuary, meadows, mountains and listless people, young and old, bathed in enervating heat and sunlight.Against this area touched but not struck by war, he has focused on three German soldiers (and the Greek wife of one of them) who go about the daily stultifying business of guarding a repository of ammunition in a crumbling fortress. The essence of their mounting ennui is dissected in a series of seemingly unconnected scenes. These representative members of the tiny occupying force paint their house, visit the town, run across a strange, wandering gypsy or make rockets as a diversion. One, a boorish ex-crane operator, makes a simple contraption for trapping cockroaches","excerpt":"the intellectual deciphers Greek texts from stones in the fortress.The ill-fated hero, however, is mysteriously cut of different cloth. As the married man of the trio, his boredom is increasingly disturbing when he requests more active duty, during which he goes berserk and, Quixote-like, begins shooting at windmills. Eventually, his insane rebellion against authority temporarily affects the whole town when he threatens to blow up the fortress to which he has retreated on learning that he will be sent home.One can accept the effects of uselessness on his companions. These are logically and precisely presented by Wolfgang Reichmann, as the stolid ex-crane man; Wolfgang von Ungern-Sternberg as the student scholar and Athina Zacharopoulou, as the obedient wife of Peter Brogle, the demented soldier. But nothing in the latter's behavior or background as shown in the film, indicates a prognosis of instability or rebellion. His performance before his breakdown is simply natural and casual. Mr. Brogle, the narrator abetting the English subtitles observes, has attempted a titanic venture but \\"like all others before him he has totally failed.\\" The analogy to titans, classic or Nazi, is, at best, extremely vague.As a writer-director in his feature film effort, Mr. Herzog has failed to make his harried hero's case or his parable believable. Otherwise, his \\"Signs of Life\\" provides vivid signs of considerable talent and promise.

Total misfires (''She Hate Me'') and unqualified triumphs (''Do the Right Thing'') are rare. His films typically oscillate from excellence to indulgence, often within a single scene. Thematic conflicts in a Spike Lee joint -- class, race, sex -- are inextricable from this artistic struggle: talent vs. discipline, precision against hyperbole, strength with actors wrestling a weakness for schematic characterizations.    A genre framework can circumscribe these tensions. Recently released on DVD, the witty, well-received heist picture ''Inside Man'' suggests that Mr. Lee would make a splendid old-school Hollywood auteur, shading the margins of mainstream entertainments with his pet themes and trademark quirks. See also ''Clockers,'' his underrated adaptation of a crime thriller by Richard Price.    But that isn't the pained and stubborn artist who gave us ''When the Levees Broke: A Requiem in Four Acts,'' an epic account of Hurricane Katrina now playing on HBO and one of the year's must-see documentaries. Nor is it the filmmaker who risked addressing 9/11 with as bold, foolish and affecting a film as ''25TH HOUR,'' screening at the BAMcinématek on Monday.    Adapted by David Benioff from his own novel, ''25th Hour'' says goodbye to Monty (Edward Norton), a New York drug dealer preparing to serve a seven-year prison sentence. To the strains of Terrence Blanchard's score (unusually subdued when it's not moaning hysterically), the movie riffs on regret and resignation as it winds through Monty's parting moments with his girlfriend (Rosario Dawson), father (Brian Cox) and two best friends (Philip Seymour Hoffman and Barry Pepper).    The film's audacity -- or for some viewers, its Achilles' heel -- is to connect this bruised melodrama to the dark wound at ground zero. Accusations of opportunism are hard to refute","excerpt":"the intended effect is inchoate by design.

And it has been made with such fine and intelligent restraint, fashioned so simply and directly and photographed with such artistry that it constitutes both a brilliant motion picture and a splendid tribute to a wonderful bunch of men.\\"Target For Tonight\\" is the authentic story of a bombing raid on Germany—a simple, factual account of how such a raid is planned and how it is executed, from the moment when a reconnoissance plane drops a picture of the target until the following fog-shrouded dawn when the last of the bombers—\\"F for Freddie\\"—comes roaring home to its base. It shows the manner in which the Bomber Command lays out its operations, how instructions are transmitted to the squadrons which are to participate, how the plan of attack is \\"briefed\\" by the men of one particular squadron and then how the crew of one powerful Wellington conducts its appointed task.This is but the structure of the picture. The true, thrilling quality of it lies in the remarkable human detail which Mr. Watt has worked into it—the quiet, efficient way in which each man goes about his job","excerpt":"the interjection of humor which even the grimmest task and danger cannot suppress, and finally the tremendous suspense of the routine bombing attack when we ride with the crew of \\"F for Freddie\\" and get the feeling of being one of them. Mr. Watt has a fine eye for color, and his camera is used with eloquence. There is not a waste shot in this picture; not one that fails to carry a sharp effect.Of them all, we will mention only one as a token of his sure dramatic sense. The lads of the bomber squadron have donned their flying togs in a small room and then have gone trooping out to board their planes, like prep school boys to play a game. The hubbub and confusion suddenly cease; the room is empty and still. But Mr. Watt holds his camera upon it—on scattered chairs and open locker doors. In that brief moment you feel the lurking fate which these young men have gone to face and a sense of their great but casual courage rushes over you.\\"Target For Tonight\\" is a picture which quickens the pulse and cheers the heart.

Even the most sophisticated globe-trotters in the audience will have no idea what they're saying, because in this suspenseful tale of an American abroad, the foreigners speak a wholly invented language. ''Yab habbin hama aga lanali pana dad'' is a typical statement. Among the impressive feats in this play -- a thriller about miscommunication and American exceptionalism that bounces back and forth between the perspective of the United States businessman Lowell (Zak Orth) and his love interest, Sara (Annie Parisse), both shown above -- is how this gibberish never sounds remotely silly. It's even a bit menacing. In the script Ms. Washburn, a nimble writer whose range includes ghost stories (''Apparition'') and political portraits (''The Ladies''), calls her play an ''elusive comedy.'' The tickets are surely worth it for this scene alone, which includes hardly an English word. While it's never clear what exactly the panic is about -- clearly, files are missing, and a great deal of money is at stake -- there is a remarkable clarity in the moment-by-moment action, which provides its own narrative. At moments the cast, which includes Liam Craig, Gibson Frazier, Nina Hellman and Ken Marks, reminds you of the way silent film stars communicate a story or, even, of the finely orchestrated chaos in Michael Frayn's ''Noises Off.'' And the longer the scene unfolds, the more you sympathize with the plight of the American businessman, constantly on the move, struggling unsuccessfully to understand and confident of his ability to do so.

It was Atlanta's franchise-record 18th consecutive victory at home. It was the fourth loss in the last 25 games for the Lakers, who had won three games in a row and 9 of their previous 10 on the road. It was the sixth time in nine games that Wilkins had scored 30 or more points. (AP) Bulls 129, Kings 82: Michael Jordan scored 34 points while playing three quarters as Chicago scored its eighth consecutive victory. The Bulls, 22-3 at home, have won 17 straight at Chicago Stadium, while Sacramento lost for the 25th time in 26 road games. (AP) Hornets 122, Pistons 114: Mike Gminski scored 5 of his 25 points in the last minute, leading Charlotte to its first victory over Detroit. The Hornets, who shot 59 percent from the field, scored the most points against the Pistons this season. (AP) Magic 103, Timberwolves 101: Jerry Reynolds scored 7 of his 14 points during a 14-7 spree to start the fourth quarter and Scott Skiles had 25 points and 14 assists as Orlando won its third game on the road this season. (AP) 76ers 103, Heat 96: Hersey Hawkins scored 26 points and led a third-quarter comeback as Philadelphia rallied from an 18-point deficit. The 76ers have never lost to Miami, winning 10 times. (AP) Pacers 106, Cavaliers 98: Micheal Williams scored 13 of his 19 points in the fourth quarter and Indiana did not allow a field goal in the first six minutes of the period as Indiana won for only the second time in the last 16 games in Richfield Coliseum. Indiana, which has won five in a row, outscored Cavaliers by 18-3 at the start of the fourth quarter. (AP) COLLEGE BASKETBALL  Princeton Clinches Ivy Tie  Sean Jackson made two 3-point baskets in the final 2 minutes 12 seconds of the first half to lead Princeton, which clinched at least a tie for the Ivy League title by defeating Columbia, 56-33. Princeton (19-2 over all, 10-0 in the Ivy) has won 11 straight games and 24 in a row at Jadwin Gymnasium. Jackson has scored 74 3-point baskets, breaking Matt Lapin's school record. Columbia is 7-16 over all and 5-6 in the Ivy. (AP) GOLF  Wyatt Ahead by 2 Strokes  Jennifer Wyatt's performance in the first round of the Hawaiian Ladies Open in Honolulu awed even one of the L.P.G.A. tour's leading players. The defending champion, Beth Daniel, the 1990 player of the year, marveled after Wyatt shot a career-best six-under-par 66 amid brisk winds and on hard greens on Thursday. Wyatt held a two-stroke lead over Patty Sheehan, with Daniel and Ok-Hee Ku of South Korea three strokes back. (AP) Lietzke Leads Los Angeles Open: Bruce Lietzke shot an eight-under-par 63 to take the second-round lead in the Los Angeles Open at the Riviera Country Club. Four players -- Ted Schulz, Andrew Magee, Davis Love 3d and Jeff Sluman -- were two shots behind Lietzke at the midpoint of the tournament. (AP) Player and Charles Disqualified: Gary Player and Bob Charles, International team partners in Chrysler Cup competition, were disqualified after hitting the wrong balls -- their own -- on the first fairway at Sarasota, Fla. Player and Charles said they were confused by a seldom-used alternate-shot stroke-play format.\\" The disqualifications helped give the United States team a 12.5-7.5 lead over the Internationals. In other matches, George Archer and Miller Barber of the United States tied Bruce Crampton and Brian Waites at 68","excerpt":"the Internationals' Simon Hobday and Harold Henning edged Chi Chi Rodriguez and Charles Coody, 66-67; and Lee Trevino and Jim Dent beat Bruce Devlin and Roberto DeVicenzo, 68-72. Each match at the Tournament Players Club at Prestancia was worth 5 points. The alternate shot format, a new addition to the Chrysler Cup this year, calls for each player to tee off, then hit his partner's ball on the second shot. From there, each two-man team selects its best ball and plays it for the remainder of the hole, alternating shots. (AP) TENNIS  Edberg Advances in 61 Minutes  Stefan Edberg, looking every bit the top player in the world, breezed into the semifinals of the $1 million Eurocard Classic in Stuttgart, Germany, yesterday by beating his fellow Swede Magnus Gustafsson, 6-2, 6-3. Edberg needed only 61 minutes to raise his career record against Gustafsson to 4-0. His semifinal opponent will be Jan Siemerink, a 20-year-old Dutchman who upset Andrei Cherkasov of the Soviet Union, 7-6, 7-5. Another Swede reached the semifinals when seventh-seeded Jonas Svensson beat Karel Novacek of Czechoslovakia, 7-6, 6-2. He will meet Guy Forget of France, the hottest player on the tour, in the semifinals. Forget, seeking his third title of the year, beat Goran Ivanisevic, 7-5, 7-6. The Frenchman, winner in Brussels last week and seeded sixth, needed 1 hour 38 minutes to beat the third-seeded Yugoslav and never lost his service. Using deadly passing shots, he broke Ivanisevic at love to take the first set. Ivanisevic saved a match point in the 10th game of the second set and had two serves at 6-6 in the tie breaker. But he made two errors at the net and Forget clinched the match. (AP) Lendl and Chang Gain: Top-seeded Ivan Lendl and fifth-seeded Michael Chang rolled to straight-set victories last night, advancing to the semifinal round of the $750,000 Volvo Indoor tournament in Memphis. Lendl powered his way past Darren Cahill, 7-6, 6-3. Chang topped Jeff Tarango 6-3, 7-5. Today, Lendl will meet the 11th-seeded Derrick Rostagno, who rallied to defeat Cristiano Caratti, 6-7, 6-2, 6-0. Chang will meet seventh-seeded Michael Stich, the defending champion, who defeated Mark Koevermans, 6-4, 6-2. (AP) N.H.L.

In the Chopin Second Concerto on Saturday night, certain passages were poorly articulated and ill focused","excerpt":"the interpretation unfolded more as a succession of startling moments than as a coherent whole. The Larghetto, however, left no doubt of Mr. Halim's gift for evocation and emotive intensity.   The central problem was the disparity between the pianist's sumptuous delivery and the somewhat meager resources of the New York Chamber Symphony, under the direction of Gerard Schwarz. Mr. Halim, perched at the edge of the stage, was under unforgiving scrutiny from the hall's close acoustics, and the orchestra did not provide full support.

Or, you can also ask Human Rights Watch. It has visited Algeria very recently. It knows, and we know.   You accuse Algeria of having opposed the application for consultative status of Human Rights Watch. This is a lie. And here is the proof: Algeria is not even a member of the United Nations committee involved. It is simply an observer (just like the United States, Britain and about 20 other countries) and, as such, cannot participate in the committee's decision making.   Indeed, your editorial, and its reference to Algeria, was disinformation pure and simple.   It seems that you have targeted Algeria, which condemned the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on the very day it took place, because it opposed the presence of foreign troops in the Persian Gulf region and the recourse to war, convinced that the crisis could have been solved through political and peaceful means within an Arab framework.

Gasoline and crude oil prices have fallen to their lowest levels since shortly before Iraq marched into Kuwait. An American Automobile Association survey released last week said that gasoline had declined to $1.135 a gallon, about the same price as before the war but for a 5-cent-a-gallon Federal tax increase. Oil, driven down by peace proposals, closed on Friday at $17.91 a barrel, less than half its October peak. But don't start celebrating just yet. Even some of those analysts who expect crude oil to stay low expect gasoline costs to rise. Iraqi and Kuwaiti refineries have been ruined in the war","excerpt":"the Iraqis were apparently torching Kuwaiti facilities at the end of the week. Even the Saudis have to import fuel to supply the military, and gasoline demand will rise more rapidly once the American economy revives. \\"There will be ample crude for refiners, but not adequate refining capacity for consumers,\\" said Alfred O. Munk, a consultant and the former foreign affairs manager for the Amoco Corporation. \\"Crude,\\" he pointed out, \\"is not what you consume.\\" The Inflation Numbers Game A recession that was supposed to extinguish inflation has still left the pilot light burning. Consumer prices rose four-tenths of 1 percent in January, eight-tenths without food and energy. Economists, who can no more take a figure at face value than Ella Fitzgerald can leave a melody unadorned, went to work explaining away the news. Look at higher liquor taxes, increased auto costs, rising apparel prices, other one-time events, they said. But a few saw underlying pressures, especially the 6 percent annual-rate increase in service costs, which account for about half of the inflation index. In dousing inflation, said William C. Dudley, a senior economist at Goldman Sachs, \\"a short, shallow recession isn't going to give you much benefit.\\" Greenspan Confused? Let nobody out-worry Alan Greenspan about the Persian Gulf war and the credit crunch. In addressing two Congressional committees last week, he rehearsed his forecast of a mild recession, but then added more fine print than your typical car-rental agreement. Some of those clauses concerned the war, but most troubling, he said, was the Fed's inability to prompt banks to resume lending to their creditworthy customers. If Mr. Greenspan usually appears as a determined general unwilling to reveal his battle plans, last week he all but confessed to confusion. He seemed uncertain about whether to maintain or lower interest rates, adding that others at the Fed are divided. Some of his colleagues counsel patience, anticipating a rebound; others have a darker outlook than his. Here Comes Unicode The United Nations' near-unanimity on Kuwait was unusual, but the computer industry's agreement to use a common digital code is truly extraordinary. The usually fractious companies, including International Business Machines, Apple, Sun and Microsoft, hope for Unicode to become a global standard representing letters and characters in every language. Companies could then more readily write software to work in a variety of languages, and international computer communications would flow more smoothly. \\"It's a lot more meaningful than Esperanto, because we're dealing with computers, not people\\" said Esther Dyson, publisher of the newsletter Release 1.0. She added that the third world would benefit the most. \\"It's like affirmative action for smaller nations,\\" she said.  Where a Bank Finds Cash Banks may be where they keep the money, but when Citicorp itself needs money, it looks to the Middle East. Prince al-Waleed bin Talal agreed last week to invest $590 million in Citicorp. He had accumulated 4.9 percent of the company's stock last year, so his latest purchase could give him 14.9 percent if he converts his new preferred stock to common. He said in 1988 that he \\"would love to be a corporate raider\\"; just a joke, his aides now explain. Exactly where all the money is coming from is unclear. Prince Waleed is indeed a nephew of Saudi Arabia's King Fahd, but he had to put up his house as collateral to get a loan from Citicorp just a decade ago. Where Citicorp will find even more badly needed capital might soon become clear. Other possible sources include the displaced royal rulers of Kuwait. \\"You go wherever there is a lot of spare cash,\\" said James E. Akins, a consultant and former Ambassador to Saudi Arabia. Even though the Saudi rulers are temporarily pinched, he said, \\"There is a lot of spare cash in the Arabian peninsula.\\" COMPANIES   Tisch Takes the Giants  Yes, it's tough to get season tickets for the New York Giants. But $60 million, or more? Fortunately for Preston Robert Tisch, 50 percent of the Super Bowl winner came with the deal. Mr. Tisch, president of the Loews Corporation, bought half of the team from Tim Mara and two other relatives, leaving the other half in the hands of Tim Mara's uncle, Wellington. Loews owns 22.9 percent of CBS, where Mr. Tisch is a director and his brother, Laurence, is chairman. Mr. Tisch has promised to keep his football investment entirely separate from the network. And it's just as well. If the Giants adopted the same financial machinations as CBS, they might start buying back thousands of season tickets to boost the price of the rest, spin off a quarterback or two and sell Lawrence Taylor to the Japanese.11 Jail for Milken, Hope for Drexel  Michael Milken, the financier who studied at Berkeley in the 1960's, is returning to that area on March 4, this time to prison. Federal District Judge Kimba M. Wood, who sentenced him to 10 years on securities charges in November, recommended last week that he serve 36 to 40 months before he is eligible for parole. Cooperation with investigators, said to be asking him about failed savings and loans that bought \\"junk bonds,\\" might get him out earlier. Even without Mr. Milken, Drexel Burnham Lambert might rise again. Drexel convinced its creditors and litigants last week to tentatively accept a fraction of what they claim -- in this case, $2 billion out of $20 billion. A Federal Judge said enough money should be left to allow Drexel to emerge from bankruptcy.  Outlook for Airlines  The Federal Aviation Administration predicted on Friday that the nation's airlines will recover their financial health once the recession and the gulf war end. The agency predicted stable or lower fuel prices, although some analysts disagree. James B. Busey, the F.A.A.'s administrator, rejected the airlines' calls for Government aid. Quincy Jones, Inc.  Bertlesmann and Time Warner may think of themselves as thriving media conglomerates, but the best example might be Quincy Jones. On Wednesday his \\"Back on the Block\\" album won six Grammy Awards, as many gold-plated horns as he could carry, bringing his total to 25. After last year's Milli Vanilli embarrassment, the award-givers can be assured that Mr. Jones himself originated, arranged, conducted and produced the album. He is best known as a record producer and arranger for musicians from Duke Ellington through Frank Sinatra to Michael Jackson. He has also written the scores for 37 movies and produced several television shows and films -- convincing Steven Spielberg to direct and Oprah Winfrey to act in \\"The Color Purple.\\" He has his own record label, and a major stake in a New Orleans television station that he oversees. His television and movie company, Quincy Jones Productions, has received so many uninvited visitors that he had to take its address off its business cards. Amgen's New Drug  The Food and Drug Adminstration gave Amgen Inc. approval for a genetically engineered medicine to help cancer chemotherapy patients fight off infections. Analysts expect the drug to become one of the biotechnology industry's best sellers. INTERNATIONAL   Another Step Toward Capitalism  If socialism, as many in Russia like to say, is the long, hard path from capitalism to capitalism, the Soviets took another halting step in that direction last week. The Government announced that prices would increase at least 60 percent on every basic need except fuel, medicine and vodka. The Soviets are trying to use central commands instead of free markets to reduce shortages, prune subsidies and set prices to more closely reflect production costs. Herbert Levine of the University of Pennsylvania, a specialist in the Soviet economy, questioned how much difference new state prices would make. \\"In many of these markets, the official channels are no longer the major suppply channels,\\" he said. In his view, barter, private markets, the shadow economy and even commodity exchanges are acclimatizing many Soviets to more capitalist ways. Slovenia's Secession  The Slovenian Parliament's declaration last week of autonomy from the rest of Yugoslavia only ratifies a status that Slovenia's economy has already achieved. Closer to Munich and Milan than to Belgrade, Slovenia has 8.5 percent of the nation's people but about 20 percent of its hard-currency earnings from exports. The Slovenes regard Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav republic, as a flabby cousin wedded to the Cyrillic alphabet and Soviet ways. The Serbs regard the Slovenes as Mercedes-driving snobs. Joseph Tragert, an economist at the Planecon consulting firm in Washington, says that Croatia's eagerness to follow Slovenia out the door might well ignite a civil war because Croatia has a large Serbian minority. \\"It's probably the end of Yugoslavia,\\" Mr. Tragert said of the Slovenian stand. But like the restive Baltic nations, he added, Slovenia and Croatia are probably too small to thrive as independent states. They might choose a loose confederation instead.

Equally important, Haiti's once-spineless Parliament approved a limited amnesty plan designed to force Gen. Raoul Cedras and his associates to step down next week, as required by the agreement they signed last month, without the sweeping pardon they had anticipated. Instead, Father Aristide, who has promised reconciliation tempered by justice when he returns to Haiti by Oct. 15, was empowered to grant the political amnesty he deems appropriate, and General Cedras was under pressure to join his police chief, Michel Francois, in exile. Praise for G.I.'s    The marked change in the political atmosphere was greeted with jubilation by ordinary Haitians, who began hauling out old Aristide banners and posters that have been in storage since the Sept. 30, 1991, coup and cautiously tested their new-found ability to exercise their rights with gatherings in the streets and pointed criticisms of the military in the press. There was also widespread praise for the American soldiers who are the guarantors of the new, more open climate.

But it soon found that it was losing too much ground and that there was no place to stop.
