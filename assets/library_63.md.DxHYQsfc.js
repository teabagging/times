Lovell. (Norton, $18.95.) This tapestry of the lives of the six gorgeous, talented, privileged (and highly eccentric) sisters who captured the imagination of Britain for much of the early 20th century doesn't play favorites -- the author seems to be fond of all of them, even as she juggles six eventful narratives with a minimum of confusion. Her group portrait ''is fascinating the way all great family stories are fascinating,'' Robert Gottlieb wrote in these pages in 2002. She manages ''to present everyone both clearly and with sympathy.''    THE SHELL COLLECTOR: Stories, by Anthony Doerr. (Penguin, $13.) The characters in this first collection of short fiction are as varied as a lonely New England teenager, a Montana outdoorsman and a blind Canadian shell collector living in Kenya, but the tales are linked by two themes: hunting and being hunted, holding on and letting go. ''Doerr's prose dazzles, his sinewy sentences blending the naturalist's unswerving gaze with the poet's gift for metaphor,'' Nancy Willard said in the Book Review last year.    NEW YORK: Songs of the City, by Nancy Groce. (Watson-Guptill, $19.95.) ''Gothamite Quick Step'' (1853), ''Wall Street Blues'' (1929) and ''Moitle From Toidy Toid and Toid'' (1946) are among the tunes in this survey of 1,000 songs about New York City. ''The book is chockablock with historical information, rare songs and lyrics,'' Eric P. Nash wrote here in 1999, and ''the illustrations provide a visual feast of sheet music covers and tinted postcards that evoke the lost world of Schrafft's, Childs and Horn & Hardart.''    THE DARTS OF CUPID: And Other Stories, by Edith Templeton. (Vintage International, $13.) These seven tales, five of which originally appeared in The New Yorker (the author is now in her 80's), seem steeped in nostalgia even as their discriminating aper&#231","excerpt":"us and minutely observed social transactions explore some audacious erotic territory: what might clinically be called sadomasochism. Last year in the Book Review, Daphne Merkin admired Templeton's ''gift for understated but uneasy-making revelation of character'' and found her stories ''sparkling with untold hazard, like pieces of cut glass.''    BEAUTIFUL BODIES, by Laura Shaine Cunningham. (Washington Square, $14.) In this sexually candid novel, six longtime women friends gather one stormy night for a boozefest at a Manhattan loft, where they unload what's in their hearts and minds and ruminate on such matters as childlessness and wayward men. '' 'Beautiful Bodies' is wonderfully entertaining and, in its casual way, wise,'' Laura Jamison said here last year.    SELECTED ESSAYS, by John Berger. Edited by Geoff Dyer. (Vintage International, $18.) Spanning nearly 50 years, this large volume of work by the distinguished British art critic and novelist includes assessments of artists like Picasso, Goya and Watteau, and reflections on poetry, literature and, above all, the creative impulse. In 2002 our reviewer, David Thomson, praised Berger's ''way with words, and the infinite meanings he finds in that common but extraordinary thing, noticing.'' The same publisher has reissued THE Shape of a Pocket ($13), also by Berger, a collection of what Thomson last year called ''short, radiant essays on things seen,'' from prehistoric cave paintings in France to the Sistine Chapel, from the Po River to Rembrandt's self-portraits.    RED DUST: A Path Through China, by Ma Jian. (Anchor, $14.) In 1983, the author, a dissident writer and artist, embarked on a spiritual pilgrimage from Beijing to Tibet, but his journey detoured into a three-year immersion in Chinese life, with its jumble of poverty, grit, moral debasement, opportunism and generosity. The result is an ''extraordinary account'' of ''a China unknown and probably unknowable to outsiders,'' Barbara Crossette said here in 2001. ''His powers of description make every page buzz with life.''    THE EYRE AFFAIR, by Jasper Fforde. (Penguin, $14.) Set in a surreal 1980's Britain where Wales is a Soviet republic and literature is embraced with religious fervor, this spirited first novel features a literary detective named Thursday Next who is hot on the trail of an extortionist who is kidnapping characters from Victorian novels. The result is ''a pop science fiction novel with brains and sass,'' Kera Bolonik wrote in these pages in 2002. ''Fforde's verve is rarely less than infectious.''

(Penguin, $13.) Among the central players in this triptych of novellas are a feminist historian having a love affair with a executive, an Irish beauty who becomes a saintly nurse in New York and John James Audubon, the American naturalist who slaughtered birds for art and science. ''Why Howard isn't cherished more is mystifying,'' John Leonard wrote in these pages in 2001. ''It's as if, while nobody watched, Mary McCarthy had grown up to be Nadine Gordimer, getting smarter, going deeper and writing better than ever before.''    THE STARDUST LOUNGE: Stories From a Boy's Adolescence, by Deborah Digges. (Anchor, $13.) A poet tells of her younger son's incorrigible childhood, and of how his angry hell-raising and defiance deeply rattled her confidence -- and her enlightened, educated assumptions about parenting. (Apparently, her son grew up at last.) While the author's blind allegiance to her child works against her in places, Emily Fox Gordon said here last year, her memoir is ''thought-provoking and intermittently beautiful.''    SLAMMERKIN, by Emma Donoghue. (Harvest/Harcourt, $14.) The title -- which means both ''a loose gown'' and ''a loose woman'' -- sums up this seamy, fact-based tale of an 18th-century London prostitute who is driven from the age of 14 to commit terrible deeds by her desire for fine clothes and the glittery trappings of a better life. The result is a ''heady, colorful romp of a novel'' that is ''almost impossible to resist,'' Laura Jamison wrote here in 2001.    GIELGUD: A Theatrical Life, by Jonathan Croall. (Continuum, $24.95.) The legendary actor (1904-2000) is portrayed as witty, modest, charming, indefatigable and far more generous than Laurence Olivier, who gave his rival grudging praise, at best. His ''artistic greatness and human fineness are amply documented'' in this ''well-researched and fluently written, committed yet not adulatory biography,'' John Simon said in the Book Review last year. ''Croall knows exactly how many anecdotes to relate, actors to quote, reviews to adduce and opinions of his own to append.''    LITTLE AMERICA, by Henry Bromell. (Vintage Contemporaries, $14.) Set mainly in a fictional Middle Eastern monarchy in the 1950's, this novel explores the clash of two American generations: that of a C.I.A. agent who cozies up to the young king and may be involved in a coup, and that of his son, an academic tracking down clues to his father's career. Last year our reviewer, James Buchan, admired ''Bromell's bold grasp of both place and period.''    THE SEVEN SINS OF MEMORY: How the Mind Forgets and Remembers, by Daniel L. Schacter. (Houghton Mifflin, $14.) In a practical survey of the pitfalls of memory, a Harvard psychologist examines the many forms of forgetting, from suggestibility to absent-mindedness and bias, and offers tips for avoiding these cognitive lapses. ''You could hardly ask for a more knowledgeable interpreter of the scientific literature,'' Stephen S. Hall wrote here in 2001. ''The exposition is solid, the advice measured.''    HOW TO BE GOOD, by Nick Hornby. (Riverhead, $13.) In this surprisingly sentimental novel by the author of ''High Fidelity'' and ''About a Boy,'' a snarling columnist and stay-at-home dad falls under the sway of a smooth-talking faith healer named GoodNews and embarks on a campaign to become a better person. His wife, a long-suffering physician, is forced to re-examine her core beliefs when she agrees to let GoodNews move in. '' 'How to Be Good' is replete with Hornby's trademark wisecracks, aper&#231","excerpt":"us and put-downs,'' Joe Queenan wrote in these pages last year.    NOODLING FOR FLATHEADS, by Burkhard Bilger. (Touchstone/Simon & Schuster, $14.) Moonshine runners, squirrel eaters, cockfighters and noodlers (those who fish for catfish with their bare hands) are among those profiled in this collection of essays about the arcane traditions of the Southern backwoods. ''Bilger's folksy descriptions of these eccentric pursuits are charming,'' E. Andra Whitworth wrote here in 2000.    EXPERIMENTS AGAINST REALITY: The Fate of Culture in the Postmodern Age, by Roger Kimball. (Ivan R. Dee, $16.95.) These essays try to reinstate the old-fashioned idea of truth -- as opposed to, say, deconstructionism -- as a crucial criterion in literary criticism. Kimball's ''intellectual rigor is refreshing,'' Catherine Saint Louis said here in 2000.
