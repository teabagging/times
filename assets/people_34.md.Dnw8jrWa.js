Since 1987, she has been heard in small roles at the Metropolitan Opera and in concert performances.   Miss Kotoski has an attractive, focused voice with a fairly bright timbre, which she uses to good, expressive effect. Her only miscalculations came at the start of the program. In Mozart's \\"Vorrei Spiegarvi, Oh Dio!\\" and in Mendelssohn's \\"Fruhlingslied,\\" she had trouble reaching and smoothly releasing her top notes.

And, while it is protecting coronary arteries against atherosclerosis and DNA against attacks by chemical carcinogens, it may also be keeping normal cells throughout the body from aging prematurely.   But vitamin E, chemically named alpha-tocopherol, does all this and more at levels well above those needed to prevent a nutritional deficiency, levels that render it a drug, not a nutrient. As a vitamin, it aids in the formation of red blood cells, muscles and other tissues and prevents oxidation of vitamin A and essential fatty acids. At high levels not attainable through diet -- 40 times or more the nutritionally needed amount -- vitamin E functions as a potent antioxidant. Why Not Take It?

He graduated from Fairfield Prep, earned a Bachelor's degree from Fairfield University and did graduate studies in Spanish at the University of Connecticut. In a career spanning 40 years he taught high school Spanish for 20 years and spent the next 20 as an executive assistant to presidents of several non-profit organizations in NYC. Terry's interests in diverse cultures led him to travel to other countries including Russia, Chile and Holland. While there he established friendships that enriched the lives of his family and other friends and which lasted for the rest of his life. Terry was a person of quiet warmth, strength and compassion, qualities consistently lived in every facet of his life. These were specially reflected in his ministry to persons with AIDS and his support of the Nature Conservancy. Along with Julian of Norwich and her cat, Terry shared with others the peace and grace at the center of contemplative prayer as well as his own love of cats. Terry's serenity in approaching his untimely death will forever serve as an inspiration to family and friends. He is survived by his sister, Celeste Mahmood and her husband Robert of Stratford, a brother, Jeffrey and his wife Barbara of Bridgeport, an aunt, Margaret Eleanor Kiernan of Stratford, a cousin, Nicholas Viner of Westport, and seven nephews, Sean, Brendan, Timothy, Randy and Christopher Kiernan and Michael and Nicholas Mahmood.

There have been a plethora of books the past few years written by prislners, notably Eldridge Cleaver's &#8220","excerpt":"Soul on Ice&#8221; and George Jackson's &#8220;Soledad Brother,&#8221; but we can't recall any written by the men on the other side of the clanging door&#8212;the guards. Now, suddenly, we have a brace of them, both first novels, &#8220;The Rap,&#8221; by Ernest Brawley, published in June by Atheneum, and &#8220;Lethal Gas,&#8221; by Ron Kurz, published in September by M. Evans. Mr. Brawley is a 37&#8208;year&#8208;old Californian who grew up within the walls (his father was a guard) and worked as a guard himself for a year. &#8220;The Rap,&#8221; is in a realistic style and the publisher likened it to James Jones's work. &#8220;Lethal Gas&#8221; falls into the black humor category and is in the form of diary entries by a prisoner called The Creep, letters, internal memoranda, news clippings and excerpts from the warden's Daily Bulletin (&#8220;Information and Guidance from the Office of the Warden&#8221;)&#8212;as well as standard novelistic scenes. &#8220;Lethal Gas&#8221; has evoked in one blurb writer the name of Nathanael West, while Herbert Katz, editorin&#8208;chief at M. Evans, terms it &#8220;a prison Up the Down Staircase.&#8221; In publishing, people tend to think in so&#8208;and&#8208;so is another so&#8208;andso terms. At any rate, Mr. Kurz, a 33&#8208;year&#8208;old Baltimore native, did eight years as a guard, administrator and &#8220;trouble&#8208;shooter&#8221; at four different Maryland correctional institutions, at a time of much turbulence, corruption and administrative shakeups&#8212;all reflected in his book. Permanently paroling himself from prison work, he, became the manager of two theaters in Baltimore and wrote much of &#8220;Lethal Gas&#8221; in his office. Mr. Brawley's hero is a prison guard, as is Mr. Kurz's. The former discovers that the villain of the story is a cousin of his (Mr. Brawley says that it is not uncommon for prison guards to have relatiVes in prison); Mr. Kurz's hero, an idealistic young man named C. C. Thomas is friendly with a black prisoner and ends up siding with the prisoners. Both books have been sold to the movies, and Ring Lardner Jr., who wrote the screenplay for &#8220;M*A*S*H,&#8221; will do the honors for Mr. Kurz's book.

And Jad Fair, its indomitably cheery lead singer and chief songwriter, has a voice that comes about as close as rock singing can to sounding like chalk on a blackboard.    Physically and vocally, Mr. Fair is the caricature of a nerd. Wiry, graceless and wearing a tense little smile, he declaims his lyrics in a shrill, neighing monotone that is oblivious to pitch. His ineptitude seems almost calculated when he interprets blues songs in jerky mechanical phrases that make every beat feel laboriously counted out.

Sound, of course, adds to the effectiveness of the film, but does little, for the story, which remains an unbelievable tale with evangelical leanings.The main situation resolves itself around the little group caught in an underground café of a Southern city at a time when a levee has broken loose and the Mississippi runs rampant over the lower valley. Those imprisoned in the place go through a complete face-about of character, the wealthy \\"wolf\\" of the cotton exchange becoming a brother under the skin with the tramp of the party.Other sets of characters are presented. In some fantastic way they are bound up in the affairs of the others. This situation, while lending imagination and interest, strains credulity to the breaking point. Co-incidences, including those in which a young man meets his former sweetheart, a stock trader encounters a business enemy, a wild preacher comes face to face with the man who ruined his home and others, all brought together in this particular saloon, are scarcely logical.The dénouement, when the victims of the imprisonment have decided to meet death and open the water grates, is surprising enough, but not conceived with any great degree of suspense. The reversion to the original traits of the various characters with the return of sunlight and safety is amusingly depicted.William Courtenay does well as the deranged preacher. Douglas Fairbanks Jr. has a not over-exacting rôle and Noah Beery is impressive in some of the sequences, but generally appears overbearing and too stiff in reciting his lines. \\"THE WAY OF ALL MEN.\\"","excerpt":"Sound Version of an Old Silent Film Is Shown at the Strand."},{"year":"1921","title":"Preparations are being made for the handling of a large gallery on the occasion of the match tomorrow between Jock Hutchison, British open champion, ...

Now that Southwest Airlines has also bounded into the Northeast, the Midwest and the Far West, the hulking airlines that mocked this Dallas upstart are taking off in frill-less imitation. Continental started a short-hop, quick-turnaround service last year, with USAir, and possibly United and Delta, expected to follow this year. They finally figured out that planes make more money in the air than on the ground, and fares with two figures attract more travelers than fares with three. Attention passengers: For Elvis imitations on board by the C.E.O., stick with Southwest. Washington's Minimalist Economists     Minimalist musicians perform extended drones. Minimalist painters sell blank canvases. At the White House, minimalist economists also have turned monotony into an art -- even though George Bush's failure to whip up the economy put Bill Clinton in the White House. Mr. Clinton promised maximal stimulus, but he soon began scaling back. A yawning deficit and rebellious Congress left him with practically no stimulus at all. By year-end, the economy was humming again anyway, letting Clinton minimalists take credit for whatever they did, or didn't, do. Lots of luck finding a minimalist health care fix. Driving Out of the Souk     One of America's most dreaded rituals is headed in the same direction as 8-track tape decks. Detroit is granting car buyers deliverance from oily or pushy or plaintive salespeople. G.M. has been selling Saturns at fixed prices for years, but cut back on haggling for Oldsmobiles only in 1993. With sales up, G.M. expanded its program, and Ford experimented. What if you're so fearful of being cheated that you insist on bargaining? G.M. promises to keep salesmen around for you.  Flocking to Rotisserie Chicken     First it was rotisserie baseball. Now everyone's betting on rotisserie chicken. Companies count on us to flock to broiled chicken stands at every mall, forsaking the buckets of chickens that had the misfortune to be fried. Boston Chicken and Clucker's Wood Roasted Chicken have had high-flying public offerings. Kentucky Fried Chicken, owned by Pepsico, has put even its name on a diet, nagging the public and press to call it KFC. Nutritionists and investment bankers praise slimmer chickens. Investors with weak stomachs should buy the birds, not the stocks. Paris and Mickey Don't Mix    Euro Disney's managers began by insisting that employees, mostly French, bathe regularly and wear \\"appropriate undergarments.\\" Now, with debts of more than $3 billion and a $900 million-plus loss in the first full year, it's the balance sheet that needs dressing up. To keep from closing, the managers are begging creditor banks and the Walt Disney Company for firmer support. Disney has been looking elsewhere, including the home turf. But are well-scrubbed Californians ready for a second Disney theme park?  Cooking With Gas     They're not about to rename Houston's football team the Gassers. But oilers are fewer as energy producers turn increasingly to natural gas. It's more abundant and cleaner burning, and its price has held fairly steady, even as oil prices have collapsed. Heating oil dealers are striking back by cranking up the temperature of their radio ads (Gas in my house? No way! One Chernobyl's enough.).  Lopez: Saint or Sinner?   In efficiency and profitability, Volkswagen and General Motors still finish at the rear of the class. Last year, they stayed there, shooting spitballs over the affections of Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua. Mr. Lopez, a Spanish arrival given to bizarre pronouncements, cut billions from G.M.'s costs. Then he vanished, only to pop up in the No. 2 spot at VW. Furious about being left at the altar, G.M. complained to German prosecutors that Mr. Lopez had run off with trade secrets and other top managers. VW denies all.

In the 1930's, Leon Theremin received considerable financial support from the original Caramoor owners, Lucie and Walter Rosen, and Mrs. Rosen herself played the electronic instrument that bears the inventor's name. Last year a documentary film featuring the theremin was shown, but until now there has rarely been a live performance at Caramoor.         Friday at 8 P.M. the theremin sounds again, as Lydia Kavina, the inventor's grand-niece, makes her Caramoor debut in recital with members of St. Luke's Chamber Ensemble. The Russian virtuoso will play several pieces of her own composition, but of particular interest is a virtually unknown Fantasy for Theremin, Oboe, Piano and Strings, written for Mrs. Rosen by Bohuslav Martinu, when the composer lived in Ridgefield. I will be the host at a post-intermission conversation with Ms. Kavina, after which members of St. Luke's add Mozart's Divertimento for Oboe, Two Horns and Strings, K251.

Dressed in shiny silver from sequined jacket to silver-lame tights to gleaming shoes, she tossed her myriad braids, traced graceful arcs and acted out lyrics with her arms, shimmied her hips and double-timed the rhythms with her feet. Every so often a percussionist from the band would stand by her and follow her motions with a gourd or a drum. Amid the flurry of motion, she sang in a voice that would be remarkable even if she were stationary: a deep contralto, capable of raw cries and rockers' rasps and lilting phrases and sweet, girlish high notes.    Miss Menezes is part of the latest outpouring of music from Bahia, the state in northeastern Brazil that fostered the tropicalia movement of the 1970's.

Mr. Cabaniss sought to depict Mr. Heflin as lacking concern for the environment. In rebuttal, Mr. Heflin emphasized his own concern for a forest in the state.    The Republican Governor, Guy Hunt, 57, overcame his Democratic opponent, Paul Hubbert.    Democrats contended that Mr. Hunt's campaign had a racial component meant to stir his conservative supporters.  ARKANSAS    Bill Clinton won a fifth term as Governor, defeating Sheffield Nelson, a former executive at a natural gas company. Mr. Clinton, a Democrat, was the beneficiary of a bruising Republican primary that left the Republican nominee weakened.    Senator David Pryor, the Democratic incumbent, ran unopposed, and the state's three incumbent members of the House of Representatives -- Democrats Bill Alexander and Beryl Anthony Jr., and Republican John Paul Hammerschmidt -- all won. In the 2d Congressional District encompassing Little Rock, former Representative Ray Thornton, a Democrat, beat Jim Keet, a Republican State Representative.  FLORIDA    Former Senator Lawton Chiles defeated the incumbent Republican Governor, Bob Martinez, in a race that in its final weeks focused largely on abortion.   Supporters of abortion rights were upset last year when Mr. Martinez tried to have the Legislature place new restrictions on abortions. The effort failed.    Senator Chiles, a Democrat who is one of the most popular political figures in the state, reluctantly supports abortion rights. Although he was widely seen as the victor in last week's televised debate with Governor Martinez, he was hurt among some voters because of his acknowledged use of a powerful anti-depressive drug.   In another hotly contested race, Representative Bill Grant of Tallahassee was defeated by Pete Peterson, a Democrat who is a retired Air Force colonel. Shortly after his re-election in 1988, Mr. Grant switched parties and became a Republican, a move Mr. Peterson painted as a breach of faith with voters.   Florida is expected to be one of the big winners in Congressional reapportionment next year. The state could pick up as many as four seats in the House, and Democrats in the Legislature will control the redistricting.  LOUISIANA    Democrats had hopes of defeating Senator Mitch McConnell, who won a narrow victory in 1984 in this heavily Democratic state. But Mr. McConnell, who showed himself to be a deft campaigner and used his incumbency to his advantage, won easily over his Democratic challenger, Havey I. Sloane, former Mayor of Louisville. Incumbents won all seven of their House races. GEORGIA     Senator Sam Nunn, the Democrat who heads the Armed Services Com mittee, was unopposed in his quest for a fourth term, but there were enough bruising races to excite the voters. Zell Miller, the Democratic Lieutenant Governor, won the contest for governor against Johnny Isakson, the State House Minority Leader, the strongest gubernatorial candidate that the Republicans have fielded in years. The incumbent, Joe Frank Harris, was ineligible to run for a third term.     Representative Newt Gingrich, the House Republican whip who led a revolt against a White House-approved budget compromise, ran in a tough race against David Worley, whom he handily defeated in 1988. In another race, Representative Doug Barnard, a Democrat, won re-election to an eighth term despite his problems explaining his ties to savings and loan institutions, which became a major issue raised by Sam Jones, his Republican opponent. Mr. Barnard is chairman of a subcommittee that oversees savings institutions. He had to explain why he accepted $20,000 in campaign contributions from Charles H. Keating Jr., who has been indicted for his role in the savings and loan scandal.  MISSISSIPPI    After defeating a strong Democratic opponent, former Gov. William F. Winter, to win a second term in 1984 vote, Mississippi's senior Senator, Thad Cochran, was in such a strong political position this year that no serious candidate chose to oppose him. Mr. Cochran was the first Republican to win a Mississippi Senate seat in the 1900's and the first Republican to win a statewide majority since Reconstruction. He did it again this year.   Republican Trent Lott, is elected in 1988 to replace the retiring John C. Stennis, is the other senator.    Jamie L. Whitten, a veteran Democratic Representative first elected in 1941, was relelected once more. NORTH CAROLINA    In the nasty Senate race, the incumbent Republican, Jesse Helms, defeated Harvey Gantt, the former Mayor of Charlotte, with about 54 percent of the vote. Mr. Gantt had hoped to become the first black Senator from the South since Reconstruction.   Political analysts said Mr. Gantt had been hurt by Senator Helms's late television commercials portraying the Democrat as an advocate of racial employment quotas. Democratic organizers said Mr. Helms's campaign, with its dependence on racial themes, offended black and white voters alike.   Representative David E. Price, a Democrat, was re-elected despite a well-financed campaign by a Raleigh businessman, John H. Carrington. Mr. Carrington scored with some voters by focusing on Mr. Price's ties to the savings and loan industry. The incumbent relied on a strong Gantt turnout. OKLAHOMA     In a three-way guber natorial contest that was bitterly contested, Democratic candidate David Walters was the winner. A 38-year-old Roman Catholic, Mr.  Walters supported a woman's right to choose an abortion and took a hard line against new taxes.    Republican Bill Price, a former United States Attorney, opposed new taxes and abortion. The dark horse in the racewas Thomas Ledger wood, a lawyer who has been a registered inde pendent since he was 21.     Democratic Senator David L. Boren easily won a third term with popularity that transcended party lines and a $1 million campaign fund.  SOUTH CAROLINA    An F.B.I. bribery investigation transformed normally routine elections for the State Legislature into competitive races as voters screamed for new state ethics and disclosure laws.   Republican Senator Strom Thurmond, who has 45 years of experience in the Senate, defeated the Democratic contender, Bob Cunningham, a retired intelligence officer. At the end of his new term, Mr. Thurmond would be be 94 years old and the oldest man ever to serve in the Senate.    Democratic Representative Butler Derrick won his ninth term in Congress, despite Republican strength in neighboring districts. Democratic Representative Liz J. Patterson overcame similar odds against Ray Haskett. TENNESSEE    Despite all the talk of the perils of incumbency, a number of office holders were easily re-elected. Senator Al Gore trounced his Republican rival, William R. Hawkins, a Knoxville economist, while Gov. Neal McWherter, was the victor over Dwight Henry, a Republican state lawmaker. All nine members of the House from Tennessee, expected to win re-election, including including Harold E. Ford, a Democrat from Memphis whose trial on Federal bank and mail fraud charges ended in a deadlocked jury in April. TEXAS    In one of the nation's most rancorous gubernatorial contests, Ann Richards, the State Treasurer, a Democrat, defeated Republican Clayton Williams, a wealthy rancher and businessman. Ms. Richards won a bitter three-way primary in which she was accused of past drug use, while Mr. Williams admitted going to prostitutes as a youth and joked about rape. In the last week of the campaign, Mr. Williams acknowledged that he paid no income tax in 1986 and confessed his ignorance of a proposed constitutional amendment.    Senator Phil Gramm, a Republican, easily won re-election in a well-financed campaign against State Senator Hugh Parmer, a Democrat. Mr. Gramm is best known as a sponsor of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget bill. VIRGINIA    Republican Senator John W. Warner easily won a third term, with no Democratic candidate opposing him. Senator Warner's only opposition was Nancy B. Spannaus, a supporter of Lyndon H. LaRouche Jr., who was listed on the ballot as an independent and took only a small fraction of the vote.    Former Gov. Gerald L. Baliles, a Democrat who left office early this year, would not run for the Senate, and his successor, L. Douglas Wilder, advised his party to abandon the race rather than run a candidate who would be crushed.    Stan Parris, a 61-year old conservative Republican, lost his House seat to James P. Moran Jr., the 45-year-old Democratic Mayor of Alexandria. In Charlottesville, Representative D. French Slaughter Jr., a Republican, won his fourth term in Congress, fighting off David M. Smith.

The Islamic sultanate of Brunei became dominant in northern Borneo in the 16th century but declined in power after the 17th century under pressure from the Dutch and other foreign powers. An Anglo-Dutch agreement of 1824 assigned North Borneo to Great Britain's sphere of influence in Asia. In 1841 a British adventurer, James Brooke, aided the sultan of Brunei in putting down a rebellion and was rewarded by being given the province of Sarawak, comprising more than half of the sultanate's area. Britain established a protectorate over Sabah, the eastern portion of Brunei, in 1881. That left the sultan with a tiny realm on the Brunei River, which was ultimately placed under British protection in 1888. The discovery of Southeast Asia's richest oilfield in Brunei and its offshore waters made the sultanate an enclave of tremendous wealth from the late 1920's onward. Following Japanese occupation during World War II, British rule resumed in North Borneo. Sarawak and Sabah became part of Malaysia in 1963. Brunei was granted independence from Great Britain on Dec. 1, 1984. The sultan of Brunei, an absolute monarch, rules from the world's largest royal palace in Bandar Seri Begawan, the nation's capital. The economy is centered almost entirely on petroleum and international banking and investments.
