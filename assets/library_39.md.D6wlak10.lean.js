The film has some pungency and lilt left in it, but it is terribly awkward.It is about Ringo, a picaresque hero who works at a tourist hotel, cons the tourists, sleeps with their wives and daughters, doctors the crabs for the crab races that are part of the hotel's slam-bang entertainment and imparts tactics and a kind of gallows philosophy to a younger colleague.\\"If you're a black man and won't play a part you're going to starve to death,\\" he counsels his busboy disciple, while giving him lessons in how to be suave and use deodorants.As Ringo — he played the same role in the extremely successful reggae film \\"The Harder They Come\\"—Carl Bradshaw makes a funny and rather noble swindler. He has, not courage but equanimity—that is, grace under pressure under a hot sun.The film makes fun of the lumpiest and palest set of tourists ever to carry plastic shoulder bags. It makes fun of an upwardly mobile hotel manager, married to a lecherous blonde. It makes fun of the blacks' own version of the anti-postcolonial struggle: If you can't beat them, scalp them.Its best parts are the good lines from the play. Ringo rationalizes his getting his two brothers-in-law jobs as lifeguards, even though they can't swim. \\"Tourists can all swim,\\" he says. \\"It's we Jamaicans who are afraid of the water.\\" He scornfully describes the foppish mulatto assistant manager as \\"a zebra looking over a whitewashed fence.\\"But there is too much literal carry-over from the play. Head talks to head, back and forth, on and on. The cuts are rough, the photography turns everything to orange and cabbage color.

Moreover, the speed at which labor markets adjust influences the effectiveness of stabilization policy.

COACH Paul Van Himst. One of the best players in the long history of Belgian soccer, he was named to replace Guy Thys in 1991 after the Red Devils failed to qualify for the 1992 European championship. As a star for RSC Anderlecht, he was nicknamed \\"the white Pele\\" and became Belgium's top career international scorer with 30 goals. STYLE While midfielder Enzo Scifo, who sets the pace with his technical skill and vision, is adept at getting the ball to his teammates, the forwards are less adept at finishing. After a quick start in World Cup qualifying with six straight victories, the Belgians struggled in their last four matches. Even if they get more punch up front, they will continue to rely heavily on defense.   TOP PLAYERS In Scifo, the Belgians have one of the game's best playmakers. He has already played in two World Cup finals. They also have a fine goalkeeper in 35-year-old Michel Preud'homme and two excellent defenders in Philippe Albert and Georges Grun, who are both coming back from knee injuries. Albert will miss the opening match because of a red card he received in the final qualifying match. Franky Van der Elst and the attack-minded Marc Degryse are quality midfielders. OUTLOOK This is the Belgians' fourth straight appearance in the cup finals. They should advance to the second round thanks to Scifo, the strength of their defense and the relative weakness of their group. How they fare after that will probably depend on whether Van Himst can find a reliable goal scorer. One player to remember is Josip Weber, a Croat who became a naturalized Belgian in March. Weber did not play in any of the World Cup qualifying matches, but he has led the Belgian first division in scoring for the past three seasons. Morocco CUP APPEARANCES Two (1970, 1986) LAST CUP 1986. BEST SHOWING Second round in 1986 FIRST ROUND Belgium, June 19 in Orlando, Fla.; Saudi Arabia, June 25 in East Rutherford, N.J.; the Netherlands, June 29 in Orlando. COACH A former world-class team handball player, Abdellah Ajri Blinda became coach of the national soccer team in September 1993, little more than a month before the decisive qualifying match against Zambia in Casablanca. Blinda guided the Lions of Atlas to a 1-0 victory. STYLE Like most North African teams, the Moroccans play with a south European flair, which means lots of short, quick passes, technical excellence and creativity. Rachid Daoudi, Mustapha el-Hadaoui and Mustapha Hadji, midfielders in the Moroccan 4-4-2, are at the heart of much of this. Lacking is consistency and a certain physical strength. TOP PLAYERS The star of the team, Daoudi, has played for WAC Casablanca since he was a teen-ager. Daoudi, 28, is a left-footed artist with free kicks and an excellent passer. The best of the expatriates are defender Nourredine Naybet, forward Mohammed Chaouch and el-Hadaoui, who all play professionally in France. Another with a French connection is Hadji, 22, whose family immigrated to France when he was a boy. He decided to play for Morocco even though he speaks no Arabic and was a star of the victory over Zambia. OUTLOOK This team is solid and opportunistic with a good defense. It is also used to hot, humid conditions, which, because it plays twice in Orlando is potentially significant. But Morocco lacks a truly dominant player, and though it should have little problem with Saudi Arabia, the Belgians and Dutch are a different matter. It would be a mild surprise if they reached the second round. Netherlands CUP APPEARANCES Six (1934, 1938, 1974, 1978, 1990, 1994.) LAST CUP 1990 (lost to West Germany, 2-1, in second round) BEST SHOWING Runner-up in 1974 and 1978. FIRST ROUND Saudi Arabia, June 20 in Washington; Belgium, June 25 in Orlando, Fla.; Morocco, June 29 in Orlando. COACH Despite leading the Dutch through a difficult qualifying group, Dick Advocaat was not guaranteed a place on the bench for the World Cup finals. His spot was only assured after Dutch soccer officials' negotiations with the considerably more renowned Johan Cruyff broke down. As a player, Advocaat, 46, was a respectable defender and midfielder. He is the former coach of the Dutch club FC Haarlem and became national team coach after the 1992 European Championship.   STYLE Unlike many top teams in the 1990's, the Dutch are committed to the attack with four men up front: two wings, a center-forward and a fourth player floating between midfield and the front line. Opposing goaltenders will see a lot of Ronald Koeman, a dangerous sweeper. TOP PLAYERS Striker Marco van Basten, the three-time European player of the year, first said he had recovered from his ankle injury and would play in the finals. Last week, he said he wouldn't because his club, AC Milan, was opposed. The more unexpected blow came May 30 when Ruud Gullit cut short his comeback with the national team and quit. The Dutch will have to make do with the group that got them to the United States in the first place: a group led by the gifted forward Dennis Bergkamp, versatile midfielder Frank Rijkaard and sweeper Ronald Koeman. OUTLOOK With Gullit and a healthy \\"Marco Golo,\\" the Dutch arguably would have been the most talented team in the tournament. Without them, the team's stock has dropped, but not as much as one might think. Even with all their stars in 1990, the Dutch barely squeaked into the second round. This time, much will depend on how quickly the team adjusts to Gullit's departure, how well Bergkamp shoulders the offensive burden. With all its questions, this team could still go a long way. Saudi Arabia CUP APPEARANCES This is the first.  FIRST ROUND The Netherlands, June 20 in Washington; Morocco, June 25 in East Rutherford, N.J., and Belgium, June 29 in Washington. COACH Jorge Solari, but maybe not for long. The Saudis have had four coaches in the last nine months. Such turnover is difficult to comprehend when you consider that the Saudis did not lose a match during qualifying. Solari, 52, took over in March.  STYLE The Saudis, like many Asian sides, have adopted the Brazilians' rhythmic, flowing game as a model. They construct, create and make the extra pass, relying on the wide-ranging attacking midfielders Saeed al-Oweiran and Khalid al-Muwallid to dictate the pace. The team used a 4-4-2 throughout qualifying and probably will not deviate because one coach was dismissed because of his desire to go with only three defenders. TOP PLAYERS The Saudis have a reasonable amount of talent, but they have only one national icon: Majed Abdullah, a 35-year-old striker from Jeddah who first joined the Saudi team in 1977 and has been selected more than 165 times for international matches. But Abdullah has grown fragile of late and missed most of the Asian World Cup qualifying tournament in October after injuring his knee. Even if he returns to form, the Saudis will need to look to their two creative, attacking midfielders, al-Oweiran and al-Muwallid, and to their two useful, young strikers, Sami al-Jaber (21) and Fahad al-Mehalel (23). With the exception of the 33-year-old captain, Mohammed Abdel Jawad, the Saudis are also young on defense. One player to watch is midfielder Fahad al-Herafi, a former star with the national team. OUTLOOK Saudi Arabia has succeeded in becoming a perennial soccer power in Asia. But Asia remains one of the world's weakest soccer regions, so don't expect to see the Saudis in the second round. An exceptionally young team, this will be the first time most of the Saudis play against world-class competition outside of a friendly. But the Saudis won't necessarily get blown out by superior opposition. They are skillful with the ball and unified after nearly a year of training exclusively together.

But their ability to approach that lofty level in the 1996-97 season is  being jeopardized by the disappointing, even dismal, performance of the programming in which the commercials have appeared.

The old U.S. policy consensus on China was shattered in the late 1980's. The  collapse of the Soviet Union deprived the U.S. and China of their common enemy,  which really was the glue holding together their strategic partnership. At the same time, the Tiananmen massacre shifted the focus in Washington from looking for ways to cooperate with China on foreign policy to looking for ways to alter  China's domestic policy. And there went the China consensus.

Assuredly there are many fine modern churches in the United States. But when the ordinary professional architect, perfectly competent in other work, is given a church to build, he takes on an artistic license seemingly laced with outright derangement and proceeds as if a proper suffusion of spiritual ambience can be obtained only by an artistic expression whose essence is its lack of restraint. And so, along the byways of America the butterfly roofs, peaks and planes with knifelike edges, miniature ski jumps and concoctions of folded and scalloped concrete are easily recognized whether or not surmounted by a cross. These disheartening excesses are not confined to the United States, but they are somewhat less prevalent in Europe, where a salutary inhibition is exercised by a very long and serious tradition of church building.

It is safe to say that few of the people affected by the measure are happy.   Congress passed the Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act of 1991 in the wake of an alcohol-related accident on a New York subway that killed several people. The legislation broadens the coverage and scope of alcohol- and drug-testing programs for \\"safety sensitive\\" employees in several transportation industries, expanding by at least three million the number of workers who would be covered.

In May, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission released guidelines it says were designed to help employers fulfill the goal of the legislation. The E.E.O.C.'s underlying principle, too, seems simple enough: Employers may not ask questions of job applicants that might lead to disclosure of a disability before an offer is made, on the theory that such disclosures would muddy hiring decisions with prejudices and stereotypes.   In fact, with a little professional guidance on the guidelines -- available from the commission -- it is not impossible to figure out what is permissible and what is not, presumably a bit of welcome news for the increasing numbers of businesses covered by the measure.

The average selling price of new cars in the United States is now more than $16,000, far above what most Americans can pay out of their own pockets.

The officially sanctioned line between \\"Taiwanese\\" and \\"mainlanders\\" has been steadily breaking down as a result of intermarriages and, more important, political liberalization.

They were brought up on antibiotics that minimized depressing chronic childhood diseases, and with post-Freudian freedom  to act out early drives. Up to age 6 or 7, television nourished them with masses of strange images and sometimes true information -- McLuhan makes a lot of sense for the kindergarten years. Long schooling would tend to make them stupid, but it has been compensated by providing the vast isolated cities of youth that the  high schools and colleges essentially are, where they can incubate their own thoughts. They are sexually precocious and not inhibited by taboos. They are superficially knowledgeable. On the other hand, all this psychic energy has had  little practical use. The social environment is dehumanized. It discourages romantic love and lasting friendship. They are desperately bored because the world does not promise any fulfillment. Their knowledge gives no intellectual or poetic satisfaction. In this impasse, we can expect a ferment of new religion. As in Greek plays, impasse produces gods from the machine.

Quinnell, are examples of a trend in suspense novels. Like many other trends today, this one is away from the personal, toward the political and the abstract. The early thrillers were about crimes of passion - motivated by love, hate, greed, envy or jealousy - but the typical hyped-up mystery novel of today is about crimes of dispassion, committed for convoluted reasons eventually traceable to politics or to a lust for power that is very close to politics.   W.H. Auden said that he liked only those murder mysteries that take place in an 18th-century vicarage. In such a well-defined setting, everything has its logic, and thrillers of this kind are really novels of manners that have run amok.

The Andy Warhol Museum, the first museum devoted exclusively to a postwar American artist, opened on May 15 in this city of his birth, a place he revisited as seldom as possible once he departed for New York. It is an impressive triumph, but not an unmitigated one.    The museum is a joint venture of two Manhattan-based organizations, the Dia Center for the Arts and the Andy Warhol Foundation (caretaker of the artist's estate), and Pittsburgh's own Carnegie Museum of Art. Its remarkable, singularly appropriate new home, a handsomely renovated 1911 industrial building redesigned by the New York architect Richard Gluckman, may be the apotheosis of the 25-year-old tradition of the renovated SoHo loft. But its austere, open spaces and contrasts of quietly sensuous materials -- tinted plaster, galvanized iron, brushed aluminum and etched glass, as well as cork and concrete -- also make it one of the best-looking and most comfortable museums to come along in some time.

In her novel ''Housekeeping,'' Marilynne Robinson says about her heroine Sylvie that ''every story she told had to do with a train or bus station.''

Photography was introduced in 1839, less than 150 years ago, amid predictions (so far unfulfilled) that it would make painting obsolete. During its first 10 or 15 years, when daguerreotypy flourished, it vastly increased the number of portraits taken without much affecting the other branches of picture-making.

Perhaps it's understandable that the directors want to establish a context to the demands of Wall Street, an environment with an atmosphere as dense and troublesome as the gravity of Jupiter. The withering compromise comes from self-generated stress, especially given that discrimination isn't as overt as it used to be on Wall Street &#151; though the number of women is still small. The burdens the subjects place on themselves, in attempts to juggle personal and work existences, is brutal and more informative than the prologue tutorial. The flux in the subjects' lives, and the determination that put them in such rarified positions, is what gives &quot;Risk&quot; some needed roughage. Much of the film takes place in the summer; Ms. Warner Wilke's husband jokes that they sure are glad their children were born in July or August, when things are slower but, as we learn, not much slower. She's striving to be included in a magazine's upcoming ranking of financial figures. The directors catch Ms. Jones on her annual return to the Upper West Side location where she was abandoned as a 2-day-old. She's in the midst of selling her company to a larger firm and contemplating motherhood.

Long before a small group of trendy writers supposedly invented something called the New Journalism -- strongly personal nonfiction writing using certain fictional methods, but without worrying too much about the facts -- Joseph Mitchell of The New Yorker was writing pieces that bore no such boastful category but were elegant in their simplicity, based on shoe-leather reporting and, yes, were factual: the Old Journalism. And yet his stylish writing had the narrative strength of good fiction.   Mr. Mitchell's venues were not the Four Seasons or Elaine's on the East Side but McSorley's Old Ale House where the Bowery ends and Sloppy Louie's near the Fulton Fish Market.  These raffish places gave a curious reporter something real to write about. The memorable pieces assembled in \\"Up in the Old Hotel\\" are not putdowns of people, but instead tolerant observations of the human comedy. The author never intrudes, even when he is writing in the first person, and he never wears a mask of writerly (horrible word) superiority.

Equally important is the fact that this film tryptych is likely to meet with the tastes of a variety of audiences. \\"Robin Hood\\" may not have the adult approach or credibility of \\"Water Birds,\\" or the youthful charm of \\"The Little House,\\" but it is an expert rendition of an ancient legend that is as pretty as its Technical hues and as lively as a sturdy Western.Appropriately enough, the producer thought enough of this centuries-old saga to film it in England, its obvious locale, and with a British cast. His principals, from Plantagenet royalty to outlaw yeomanry, speak dialogue which does not grate on the ear. And, the action—the courtly speeches and romance are kept to a sensible minimum—is robust and fairly continuous.The tale, for those who have never been to the movies or haven't heard it before, is still as true to form as Robin's fabulous archery. England, with Richard the Lion Heart held captive in Austria and his brother, the treacherous Prince John, mulcting the Midlands, is hardly a merry area. So, Robin again is ensconced in Sherwood Forest with his bold band, robbing \\"the rich to aid the poor.\\"This, of course, brings him into constant contact with the dastardly Sheriff of Nottingham and an occasional rendezvous with the Maid Marian, an ever-loving wench who can recognize a hero when she sees one. And, with the aid of such stalwarts as Little John and Friar Tuck, it is no time before Prince John's coffers are emptied to ransom Richard and Robin is rewarded with an Earldom and, naturally, the Maid Marian.Richard Todd seems rather puny but is agile enough as the most feared long bowman of the greenwood. Joan Rice is pretty and mischievous as the dark-haired Maid Marian. And such veteran British character actors as James Hayter, James Robertson Justice, Peter Finch, Martita Hunt and Hubert Gregg contribute the proper adventurous and villainous assists as Friar Tuck, Little John, the Sheriff, the Queen Mother and Prince John, respectively.

Dr. Thomas studied the conditions of the atmosphere of the place, and before another year had come planned the erection of a Summer home about the centre of the east bank of Agawam Lake.          It was not long before some of the doctor's friends and patients . . . began to purchase land and to build for themselves there. . . .

A club was organized, called the Meadow Club, a little church in the sand hills between the lake and the sea was built and poetically christened St. Andrew's- by-the-Sea, and there  began to be a quickening of the social atmosphere.

And again, as in \\"Make Mine Music!\\" he has come up with a gaudy grab-bag show in which a couple of items are delightful and the rest are just adequate fillers-in. Like healthy, imaginative children, those Disney boys are full of strange caprice. One minute they are doing something charming","excerpt":"the next minute they are slopping in the jam.Happily, the jam pots have been more carefully held from their reach by Mr. Disney for this production than they have been for previous package shows. And such love-bird and Valentine song slides as have larded—well, \\"Make Mine Music!\\" say—are conspicuously absent from the program of seven items in \\"Melody Time.\\" However, some mischievous rascal does occasionally slip behind Walt's back and, before the custodian can grab him, gets his hand on and flings a blob of goo.Most delightful item, for instance, is a cartoon telling of the legend of Pecos Hill, the cussed, coyote-crossed cowboy who was the first Texas superman. When the picture is riotously reporting the deeds of this gravel-grained galoot, to the rib-tickling musical narration of Roy Rogers and the Sons of the Pioneers, the yarn has the charm and ingenuity of the best of Mr. Disney's cartoons. Pecos Bill digging rivers and roping rain clouds is a gem of the animator's art.But when a prettified, pin-up-type cowgirl is introduced as his sweetheart, Sluefoot Sue, the Munchausen sweep of the conception is marred by a sticky smear of jam. Pretty girls with trim proportions are bait for the comic-book goons. And when the cameras are briefly brought to focus on the real-life Mr. Rogers and his chorus, posing around a phony campfire, the item descends to the banal.However, there's not too much of this. Pecos Bill is, withal, a lot of fun, and so, too—except for some slight sugar—is a prior sketch on Johnny Appleseed. This cartoon of the legendary character who went around the West planting apple trees is a sweet juvenile entertainment, in the familiar Disney inspirational style, and the songs that go along with it are nicely sung by choral groups and Dennis Day. For the kiddies, too, there is a fable about a tugboat, Little Toot, which has the conventional adventures of a naughty little fiction character. The Andrews Sisters sing its story not very excitingly.Brief but eminently enjoyable is a musical fantasy entitled \\"Bumble Boogie,\\" which Freddy Martin's orchestra plays. Based upon Rimsky-Korsakoff's \\"Flight of the Bumble Bee,\\" it is illustrated by a swirl of musical symbols overwhelming a frantic little bee. And a fast skit called \\"Blame It On the Samba\\" has humor, rhythm and charm.Less smart but adequate to the program is a Christmas-card sort of cartoon about a loving boy-girl skating couple, entitled \\"Once Upon a Wintertime.\\" There is also a ponderous poem-in-color done to Fred Waring's banding of \\"Trees.\\"Although the music lacks distinction, the drawing and color are generally fine and the humor is typically Disneyian in this take-your-pick \\"Melody Time.\\" Disney's Newest Cartoon Array, 'Melody Time,' Opens at Astor -- Seven Scenes Featured"},{"year":"1948","title":"A rather intriguing idea for a mystery-adventure film has been botched in the French production, \\"A Friend Will Come Tonight.\\" This idea is that the leader of a group of French Maquis should be hidden among the inmates in a sanitarium for the insane in the French Alps and should direct the local resistance, along with some similarly placed associates, from that retreat.But in putting a script together, Jacques Companeez and Raymond Bernard apparently thought they were Jean Paul Sartre as well as E.

P.'s were replaced by the diplomats, the politicians and the papacy is on the cynical side.Signor De Filippo has apparently torn a couple of pages from Chaplin's \\"Monsieur Verdoux.\\"However, like Chaplin, he is funny — awfully funny — himself, at times, as a meek streetcar conductor who is pushed around dreadfully during the war. And so is the comical Toto as a neighborhood enterpriser who will do any odd job for money, from posing as a corpse to serving a sentence in jail.These two middle-aged Punchinellos may clash rather harshly with the wife of the former, played by Leda Gloria, who is a pretty mean sort of shrew, or with the slinky black-marketer of Dante Maggio or with the trampy daughter that Delia Scala plays. They certainly clash with the elements of raw realism in this film. Signor De Filippo as the director has miscast Signor De Filippo as the star.

There was, for instance, a quickie tribute to \\"93 winners or nominees written or co-written by women.\\" But as luminaries were seen entering the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, the background music was \\"Thank Heaven for Little Girls.\\"   The show was determined to honor women as sanctimoniously as possible, provided it could retain the usual quota of dancing girls.

Titled ''Exodus,'' it will be shown in two parts: an hour on May 18 and a two-hour episode one week later. That May 25 episode will clash with another oversize finale, that of Fox's ''American Idol.'' Nigel Lythgoe, an executive producer of ''Idol,'' said he understood why ABC wanted that match-up: ''We're lucky enough to be in a position to be America's No. 1 show. They're not. So we've got everything to lose, and they haven't, to be frank.''    Dating to the first season of ''Survivor'' in 2000, reality franchises have often concluded in a prolonged fashion. ''The Amazing Race,'' ''The Bachelor'' and ''American Idol'' close with two-hour episodes","excerpt":"the nine ''Survivor'' and the first two ''Apprentice'' finales have been three hours. More hours means more hype, not to mention more commercials to sell. Series finales have played the supersize-me game, too: the hourlong ''Friends'' retrospective before the show's final episode last May was the third most watched prime-time show of 2004, and CBS plans to give ''Everybody Loves Raymond'' the same treatment this season. But while expanded episodes of scripted shows are nothing new -- think ''Love Boat,'' then think ''wedding cruise to Alaska'' -- impromptu ones are. In an interview with the Sci Fi Channel's Web site, the supervising producer of ''Lost,'' Javier Grillo-Marxuach, said ABC had asked the show's producers to make the May 25 episode 90 minutes long. When the writers handed in a draft that was even longer, he said, ABC decided to go ahead with a two-hour episode.    The makers of other scripted shows will be watching how a longer ''Lost'' fares: the Wednesday edition of ''American Idol'' averages nearly 10 million more viewers than the supernatural adventure show. ''We are the event of the night,'' Mr. Lythgoe said of the ''Idol'' finale. ''We finish there and then. If I were a viewer, I'd probably Tivo 'Lost' and want to be a part of the live event of 'American Idol.''' That would be five hours of viewing time. What comes next: weeklong finales? Monthlong? Perhaps not; in a sign that producers might be sensing finale bloat, the third ''Apprentice'' will end in a single hour on May 19.

To one who has made a career in broadcast news, and a companion career in seeking to preserve the language in a reasonable state of health, it is encouraging that such a series should find its way onto television. It might also be taken as encouraging that the programs reflect the view that worry about the decline of English is unwarranted and misplaced. English, so Mr. MacNeil has concluded after three years of work on the series, is a mighty river that grows ever wider and richer.\\n\\nIf this is so, then television, which is so vastly influential, must itself contribute to the growing width and richness. Unfortunately, there's a good deal of evidence that points in the opposite direction.

Dialogue: Showdown on Endangered Species","excerpt":"The Noah Principle"},{"year":"1993","title":"Beginning in 1959, Umberto Eco contributed a monthly column of wit and parody to an Italian literary journal. In the 1960's the columns were collected and went through two editions. Some of them have now been translated by William Weaver and will be published in paperback in May by Harcourt Brace & Company as a Helen and Kurt Wolff Book under the title \\"Misreadings.\\" The excerpts below are taken from a piece titled \\"Regretfully, We Are Returning Your . . .\\" -- reports from professional readers of manuscripts submitted to publishers by agents or hopeful authors.\\n\\n\\"The Bible.\\" Anonymous.\\n\\nI must say that the first few hundred pages of this manuscript really hooked me. Action-packed, they have everything today's reader wants in a good story. Sex (lots of it, including adultery, sodomy, incest), also murder, war, massacres and so on.\\n\\nThe Sodom and Gomorrah chapter, with the transvestites putting the make on the angels, is worthy of Rabelais","excerpt":"the Noah stories are pure Jules Verne; the escape from Egypt cries out to be turned into a major motion picture. In other words, a real blockbuster, very well structured, with plenty of twists, full of invention, with just the right amount of piety, and never lapsing into tragedy.\\n\\nBut as I kept on reading, I realized that this is actually an anthology, involving several writers, with many -- too many -- stretches of poetry, and passages that are downright mawkish and boring, and jeremiads that make no sense.\\n\\nThe end result is a monster omnibus. It seems to have something for everybody, but ends up appealing to nobody. And acquiring the rights from all these different authors will mean big headaches, unless the editor takes care of that himself. The editor's name, by the way, doesn't appear anywhere on the manuscript, not even in the table of contents. Is there some reason for keeping his identity a secret?\\n\\nI'd suggest trying to get the rights only to the first five chapters. We're on sure ground there. Also come up with a better title. How about \\"The Red Sea Desperadoes?\\"\\n\\"The Odyssey.\\" Homer. \\n\\nPersonally, I like this book. A good yarn, exciting, packed with adventure. Sufficient love interest, both marital fidelity and adulterous flings (Calypso is a great character, a real man-eater); there's even a Lolita aspect, with the teen-ager Nausicaa, where the author doesn't spell things out, but it's a turn-on anyway. Great dramatic moments, a one-eyed giant, cannibals, even some drugs, but nothing illegal, because as far as I know the lotus isn't on the Narcotics Bureau's list. The final scene is in the best tradition of the Western: some heavy fist-swinging, and the business with the bow is a masterstroke of suspense.\\n\\nWhat can I say? It's a page turner, all right, not like the author's first book, which was too static, all concerned with unity of place and tediously overplotted. By the time the reader reached the third battle and the 10th duel, he already got the idea. But this second book is a totally different thing: it reads as smooth as silk. The tone is calmer, pondered but not ponderous. And then the montage, the use of flashbacks, the stories within stories. . . . In a word, this Homer is the right stuff. He's smart.\\n\\nToo smart, maybe. I wonder if it's all really his own work. I know, of course, a writer can improve with experience (his third book will probably be a sensation), but what makes me uncomfortable -- and, finally, leads me to cast a negative vote -- is the mess the question of rights will cause. In the first place, the author's nowhere to be found. People who knew him say it was always hard to discuss any changes to be made in the text, because he was as blind as a bat, couldn't follow the manuscript, and even gave the impression he wasn't completely familiar with it. Did he really write the book or did he just sign it?\\n\\"The Divine Comedy.\\" Alighieri, Dante.\\n\\nAlighieri is your typical Sunday writer. (In everyday life he's an active member of the pharmacists' guild.) Still, his work shows an undeniable grasp of technique and considerable narrative flair. The book, in the Florentine dialect, consists of about a hundred rhymed chapters, and much of it is interesting and readable. I particularly enjoyed the descriptions of astronomy and certain concise, provocative theological notions. The third part of the book is the best and will have the widest appeal; it involves subjects of general interest, concerns of the common reader -- salvation, the Beatific Vision, prayers to the Virgin. But the first part is obscure and self-indulgent, with passages of cheap eroticism, violence and downright crudity. But the greatest drawback is the author's choice of his local dialect (inspired no doubt by some crackpot avant-garde idea). We all know that today's Latin needs a shot in the arm -- it isn't just the little literary cliques that insist on this. But there's a limit, after all, if not in the rules of language then at least to the public's ability to understand.\\n\\"Justine.\\" Sade, D. A. Francois.\\n\\nThe manuscript was in a whole pile of things I had to look at this week and, to be honest, I haven't read it through. I opened it at random three times, in three different places, which, as you know, is enough for a trained eye.\\n\\nWell, the first time I found an avalanche of words, page after page, about the philosophy of nature, with digressions on the cruelty of the struggle for survival, the reproduction of plants, and the cycles of animal species. The second time: at least 15 pages on the concept of pleasure, the senses and the imagination, and so on. The third time: 20 pages on the question of submission between men and women in various countries of the world. I think that's enough. We're not looking for a work of philosophy. Today's audience wants sex, sex, and more sex. In every shape and form.\\n\\"A la Recherche du Temps Perdu.\\" Proust, Marcel.\\n\\nThis is undoubtedly a serious work, perhaps too long, but as a paperback series it could sell.\\n\\nBut it won't do as is. It needs serious editing. For example, the punctuation has to be redone. The sentences are too labored; some take up a whole page. With plenty of good in-house work, reducing each sentence to a maximum of two or three lines, breaking up paragraphs, indenting more often, the book would be enormously improved.\\n\\nIf the author doesn't agree, then forget it. As it stands, the book is too -- what's the word? -- asthmatic.\\n\\"Critique of Practical Reason.\\" Kant, Immanuel.\\n\\nI asked Susan to take a look at this, and she tells me that after Barthes there's no point translating this Kant. In any case, I glanced at it myself. A reasonably short book on morality could fit nicely into our philosophy series, and might even be adopted by some universities. But the German publisher says that if we take this one, we have to commit ourselves not only to the author's previous book, which is an immense thing in at least two volumes, but also to the one he is working on now, about art or about judgment, I'm not sure which. All three books have more or less the same title, so they would have to be sold boxed (and at a price no reader could afford); otherwise bookshop browsers would mistake one for the other and think, \\"I've already read this.\\"\\n\\nThere's another problem. The German agent tells me that we would also have to publish the minor works of this Kant, a whole pile of stuff including something about astronomy. I would advise against getting involved with a man like this; we'll end up with a mountain of his books in the warehouse.\\n\\"The Trial.\\" Kafka, Franz.\\n\\nNice little book. A thriller with some Hitchcock touches. The final murder, for example. It could have an audience.\\n\\nBut apparently the author wrote under a regime with heavy censorship. Otherwise, why all these vague references, this trick of not giving names to people or places? And why is the protagonist being put on trial? If we clarify these points and make the setting more concrete (facts are needed: facts, facts, facts), then the action will be easier to follow and suspense is assured. Genuine writing has to keep in mind the old newspaperman's five questions: Who? What? When? Where? Why? If we can have a free hand with editing, I'd say buy it. If not, not.\\n\\"Finnegans Wake.\\" Joyce, James.\\n\\nPlease, tell the office manager to be more careful when he sends books out to be read. I'm the English-language reader, and you've sent me a book written in some other, Godforsaken language. I'm returning it under separate cover.

Yet never in all the years of our friendship - I saw Jean at the hospital the day before her death in 1979 - did she even hint at something I've just discovered: She had written two novels prior to ''Boston Adventure.'' The first remained unfinished, because a publisher was afraid of a libel suit, and Jean abandoned it; she completed the second, for which she had a contract, and it was rejected. All this happened before her marriage to Lowell. It's perfectly understandable that Jean would not have talked about these early unsuccessful efforts while ''Boston Adventure'' was in the process of being published, but I'm surprised she never mentioned them later, since she enjoyed telling stories about her younger years.

According to the figures, compiled in partnership with Nielsen EDI, the international box office expanded about 4.9 percent to $26.7 billion. That figure was given a boost by the weakness of the dollar against some foreign currencies, including the euro. One of the more startling year-to-year changes was a sharp rise in spending by the studios’ specialty divisions, which make and distribute some films intended for the annual awards races and others aimed at getting fans of horror and other genres.

The shrinkage has been a long-term trend caused mainly by more efficient production and the economic contretemps of the early to mid-1980's that forced many farmers into bankruptcy.   But if the 1,925,300 farms are much fewer than in past years, the farmers operating them are much better at it than they were a scant decade ago when declining land values, huge crop surplus and plunging commodity prices touched off the largest round of foreclosures since the Great Depression.

The tug of war in the title of this fine military history is not, as one might suppose, between Allied and German forces, but among rival Allied commanders, primarily the British and Americans. Dominick Graham, a professor of history at the University of New Brunswick, Canada, and Shelford Bidwell, author of ''The Chindit War'' and other historical works, take both a psychological and a tactical look at a campaign ''full of examples of the pitfalls of coalitionary war, and \\n[\\nthat\\n]\\n offers an insight into Anglo-American relations at a period fraught with mutual dislike and suspicion.'' American and British commanders, the authors write, ''despised each other for lack of drive, attacking in insufficient strength and lack of appetite for combat.'' Even where animosity was absent, personality played a part: Mr. Graham and Mr. Bidwell describe Dwight Eisenhower, commander of Allied forces in Europe, and Sir Harold Alexander, the British commander in chief, as ''easy-going'' and ''malleable,'' and write that ''neither could make a military plan and stick to it through political and military vicissitudes.'' The book is a triumph of organization","excerpt":"the numerous threads of suspicion, intuition, logic and military necessity are displayed clearly, and their countless points of intersection analyzed. The result is a remarkably lucid account of a complicated campaign. The war in Italy, begun with the vain hope of an uprising by the Italian Army against the Germans, saw, among other things, a sit-down strike by British troops, was hampered at many points by weather and geography as much as by the enemy, and throughout was viewed by the Allied governments as little more than a diversion; the war in the Pacific and the invasion of Europe were the important things.
