Probably no more concocted than Frank Buck's bring-'em-back-alive thrillers, which purport not to be, Mr. Elliott surpasses the Buck in that he captures tigers, studies monkeys, braves the natives and has time, as well, for a bit of fictional melodrama.The \\"Booloo\\" of the title is a white tiger presumably venerated by the dart-blowing Sakai who propitiate it, according to the established routine, by sacrificing a beautiful maiden every year. When General Rogers' postumously published account of Booloo appears, the members of the Royal Something-or-other Society pronounce it a hoax and cross the General's name from their roll of honor. His son (Colin Tapley) takes up the challenge and promises to prove the white tiger story. Mr. Elliott and his roving game hunters carry on from there.Except for the white tiger, whose ruffled coat betrays the fact that it's an ordinary striper sprayed with paint, the animal acts seem to be genuine enough and the working of the snares, traps, pits and native beaters remains as fascinating as ever. Even the fanciful phase of it, young Rogers' capture by the Sakai and the torture ceremony, have been re-created with a conservatism and conviction unusual for these jungle fantasies. The beasts are the stars of the piece, naturally, but Mr. Tapley, Claude King, Jayne Regan, Mamo Clark and the others have their virtues, too.At the 86th Street CasinoThe principal merit of \\"Mit versiegelter Order\\" (Under Sealed Orders), the new German offering at the Eighty-sixth Street Casino, is its surprise ending. Which makes it all the more thoughtless on the part of the management to give it away in a program summary of the story.Blonde Suse Graf, who reminds one of Marlene Dietrich before the latter became so langourous, is the chief feminine interest as the secretary of the German Minister (Ernst Leudesdorff) in an unknown oriental country. German and other foreign contractors are fighting there for a concession involving the construction of an irrigation and power system and mining rights. Paul Hartmann is excellent as the head engineer and Victor de Kowa does well in the role of the dandified nephew of the Minister who makes good just the same. Hans Stiebner's work as a greasy, despicable proprietor of a resort for foreigners cannot be beaten.The air is thick with plots and counter-plots, but Karl Anton, who directed the film for the Majestic company, manages to keep them from being too confusing. The settings are realistic.At the 86th St. Garden TheatreAbout the only new things in \\"Zwischen den Eltern\\" (Between the Parents), Just arrived from the UFA studios at the Eighty-sixth Street Garden Theatre, are a clever child actor named Peter Dann and a substantial blonde actress called Jutta Freybe. Both do very well in their respective roles of son and wife of the popular Willy Fritsch, this time a research physician temporarily lured from his fireside by the brunette charms of Gusti Huber.While the audience is at no time in doubt as to the outcome of the story, there are moments when the exact way in which Peter will \\"do his stuff\\" gives cause for some speculation. Friedrich Kayssler is excellent as the gruff professor under whom the young doctor is carrying on his experiments. Hans Brausewetter is fair as an editor eager for a \\"scoop\\" on a scientific matter. Hans Hinrich was the director.

The Gaylord systems have 180,000 subscribers in Southern California, North Carolina and South Carolina, giving the deal a value of approximately $2,000 per subscriber, the average price in recent cable deals.    The deal will place Charter, a privately held company based in St. Louis, in the top 20 of the largest American cable systems, with 850,000 subscribers.     \\"It was a strategic decision on our part, to refocus our management time on our core business, our cable networks,\\" said Alan Hall, a spokesman for Gaylord, which is based in Nashville.     Gaylord's networks include TNN: The Nashville Network","excerpt":"CMT: Country Music Television, and CMT International. The company also owns Z Music, three television stations and three radio stations as well as the Grand Ole Opry, Opryland Hotel and the Opryland Theme Park.     Gaylord, which owns 97.1 percent of the cable systems, suffered a loss in the transaction, since it bought the systems for $418 million in 1989. \\"But we will have a large book gain, thanks to the amortization and depreciation\\" of the systems, Mr. Hall said.     Given Gaylord's 97 percent ownership, the sale price will equal $2,111 a subscriber, said Sharon Armbrust, a telecommunications analyst with Paul Kagan Associates. \\"It's an attractive cable price, given the tax-oriented structure of the deal,\\" she said, referring to one of the sale terms, a $170 million note, which has a 10-year maturity, giving Gaylord a tax deferral.    \\"Charter has risen very quickly to become a major player,\\" she said.     By selling its cable systems, Gaylord will be able to charge other cable operators higher fees for its cable programming.    Under new regulations of the Federal Communcations Commission, the owners of cable-television systems that also produce entertainment must provide it at a uniform rate, which in the case of Gaylord equalled the discounted rates of high-volume, larger cable companies.     The transaction \\"will eliminate the negative revenue impact on our cable networks, TNN and CMT, from the cable vertical integration rules,\\" said E. W. Wendell, president and chief executive of Gaylord Entertainment.     \\"We'll be able to charge more in the future,\\" Mr. Hall said.    Gaylord had revenues of $643.6 million in 1992. Gaylord's balance sheet was restated in 1993, after the company indicated that it was looking for a buyer for its cable systems, which came off the books. The 1993 income statement showed that revenues in that year were $622.6 million, exclusive of the cable systems.     The deal was announced after the stock market closed. Earlier, Gaylord's shares ended at $22.75, up $1.25.    Kelso & Company, Charter's partner in the Gaylord deal, is a Manhattan-based leveraged-buyout company. Kelso and Charter will pay $200 million in cash and a 10-year, $170 million note with an initial interest rate of 12 percent.     In addition, Gaylord will get 15 percent of the net proceeds of the Kelso-Charter joint venture if it is sold, \\"so that Gaylord will be able to share in the potential upside of this deal,\\" said Jerry Kent, one of the three managing partners of Charter. Mr. Kent said Charter has no current plans to sell.     Mr. Wendell, the Gaylord president, said that the structure of the deal with Charter will \\"give the company the potential for participating in the growth of a larger, more geographically diverse cable operation,\\" he said.
