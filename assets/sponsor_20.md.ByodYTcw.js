Although its purpose is often nothing more than to be a visual prank, caricature at its best has often been an acerbic and accessible form of social and political criticism. In THE SAVAGE MIRROR: The Art of Contemporary Caricature (Watson-Guptil, paper, $29.95), Steven Heller, the art director of The New York Times Book Review, and Gail Anderson, the deputy art director of Rolling Stone, present an overview of contemporary caricature, tracing its evolution from 19th-century France through its powerful resurgence in the United States from the mid-1950's to the mid-1970's. The authors explain the roles that editorial preferences, design fads and technology have played in creating the current scene, which they seem, almost in spite of themselves, to find disappointing. For Ms. Anderson and Mr. Heller, caricaturists have great power -- and perhaps even a duty -- to address the issues of the day, to use their skills to rouse the public. Today the subjects of caricature are less likely to be political figures than celebrities, who menace our sensibilities more than our freedom. As the book amply illustrates, in changing from pen to airbrush, caricature has gone from inspired anger to dextrous hipness. Ms. Anderson and Mr. Heller clearly believe that a caricature should communicate an idea","excerpt":"as they survey contemporary caricature, they see \\"little gems of mild distortion\\" rather than a savage mirror that confronts society with its sorry reflection. This profusely illustrated book provides an excellent introduction to its subject, and the authors are persuasive in their arguments for the importance of caricature.

WALKER EVANS: The Hungry Eye. By Gilles Mora and John T. Hill. (Abrams, $60.) Walker Evans is fast replacing Paul Strand, Alfred Stieglitz and Edward Weston as the most influential photographer of the 20th century. \\"The Hungry Eye\\" shows why. Evans used reticence and restraint as rhetorical devices, taking straightforward, seemingly dispassionate pictures of American life that brim with intelligence and, in the aggregate, emotional and political fervor. The book's title, taken from an Evans remark about himself, is flagrantly ironic: there is little about Evans's style to suggest an indiscriminate consumer, and yet his work offers a feast of visual pleasures.

Ferdinand Rieche, a security policeman demoted for overzealousness, is having breakfast. With a mournful countenance, a prominent nose and a face that resembles both mousetrap and mouse, he devours raisin cake. The radio announces a tropical storm approaching Wiesbaden.Ferdinand grabs his atlas, locates Wiesbaden, assesses its distance from the East German frontier, road routes, rivers. He chews and ponders: who can be behind this storm?This is part of the prologue of Alexander Kluge's \\"Strongman Ferdinand,\\" a satire on West German society that is being shown in the New York Film Festival at Alice Tully Hall today and tomorrow. It is obsessively narrow in its focus and drawn out too far, but in its better moments—and there are a lot of them—it is original, apt and very, very funny.Nothing is so troublesome to a society as a man who follows its principles literally. To Kluge, West Germany is a society that maintains a fat complacency by making an idol of order and resistance to change.Rieche is the dangerous total believer. He pursues order to the point where it becomes outlawry, mad yet oddly logical. Security is his profession and his obsession. When a superior at the factory where he has become chief of security—after leaving the police force—questions the usefulness of his elaborate measures, he retorts:\\"With security, it's not a question of usefulness.\\" It is a question of the whole purpose of life.\\"Strongman Ferdinand\\" is the tragicomic story of what happens when Rieche—50, in poor health, his career broken by his tendency to harangue his police superiors on the need to arrest people before they break the law—gets a last chance.The factory security post becomes vacant. The previous chief was discharged for placing snipers to shoot workers who break plant discipline. The press had got on to the story, and so the bosses—bland, hypocritical men — hire Rieche. They order him to do \\"enough, but not too much\\" but they have hired a one-man disaster.Within 48 hours, Rieche has knocked down his office walls with a sledgehammer to make it bigger, turned it into an advanced communications post, begun drilling the middle-aged factory guards as an élite commando force, and put in so many locks that the washroom attendant is locked in.Obstacles are put in the way of this small figure with the enormous head who storms around in a green trenchcoat, upsetting everything. He has to take a medical exam: his solution is to force a young woman employee caught pilfering to give him her urine sample. \\"Very young urine,\\" the doctor congratulates him. \\"In fact, if you were a woman, I'd say you were three months pregnant.\\"More seriously, the factory bosses keep cracking down on him for excess","excerpt":"as when he and his guards raid another factory for a training exercise, or when he insists on body-searching a group of visiting American industrialists. It become a mounting war between Rieche and management and eventually, as the battles become more and more comically outrageous, between Rieche and a society that can't understand his efforts to defend it.The movie is done in short, clipped sequences — there are too many of them, though — each like a brief stanza in the ballad of Rieche. The dry, deadpan style of this social fantasy is counter-pointed beautifully by a camera that becomes lyrical: focusing on a full moon wrinkled by chimney smoke, or showing the security guards drilling on the beach at dawn and lit up in profile like a line of long-legged wading-birds.The harshness is redeemed even more by the character of Ferdinand himself, memorably played by Heinz Schubert. He is a small man who sometimes totters under the weight of his big mission. He is fond of cake and his blonde taxi-driving girlfriend, Gertie. They celebrate birthdays at midnight feast in cheap restaurants, and go on a winter trailer trip to practice for Christmas.\\"Christmas needs training or it won't work,\\" Rieche says. He is something like Chaplin; something like Hitler played by Chaplin. The combination is unforgettable.

For the facts are, in themselves, wildly melodramatic","excerpt":"as wildly melodramatic indeed as a British air raid on the Kiel Canal, as England defending its shores against an enemy bombing flight, as a glimpse into the Sax Rohmerish master control room where the war in the skies is marshaled.The film employs the March of Time technique (although not its objectivity) in that it has newsreel shots, re-enacted scenes of previous fact and a commentator's voice (Lowell Thomas's) bridging the gaps in the dialogue and covering the film's expository phases. It deviates from that formula and makes its modest concession to fiction and editorial in adding a slight personal story acted out by Ralph Richardson, Merle Oberon and a few other players. It is Miss Oberon, as the wife of the Air Force headquarters man, who makes the film's ultimate plea, on behalf of England's wives and mothers, for a speedy and honorable end to this war for the right to freedom and justice and human dignity. And Mr. Richardson, with typical British reserve and dislike for emotional displays, falls asleep as she makes her little speech.That scene is illustrative of the general spirit of the film; illustrative, in a way, of the general spirit of England at war as \\"The Lion Has Wings\\" has captured it; purposeful, proud, firmly resolved, yet not so sober about it all as not to indulge in a grin now and then. The re-enactment of the British raid over Kiel, with a pocket battleship its target, is a grim and suspenseful bit of film business, but the picture that lodges in the back of our mind, for good cheer's sake, is the sight of the chap chalking \\"One for Adolf\\" on the bomb he has just fastened in its rack.The German raid, with its ensuing marshaling of Britain's defenses—the balloon barrage, the men at the listening posts, the chessboard tactics in the control room, the flight of counter-attacking Spitfires, the dogfights and the firing of the antiaircraft batteries—is a gripping and fearful sequence. But what stands out is the comment of a cockney at an anti-aircraft gun: \\"'Ere comes the Narsties!\\"It isn't cricket to take sides, and there's no disputing that \\"The Lion Has Wings\\" is confident of finding its spectators on England's—or of getting them there. But labeling it propaganda doesn't alter the fact that it makes an interesting, informative and thrilling show.At the Teatro LatinoAdmirers of good horseflesh and persons interested in the difference between the Spanish and Portuguese styles of bullfighting cannot go wrong in visiting the Teatro Latino this week. In \\"El Gavilan\\" (\\"The Hawk\\") they will see fine exhibitions of the usual Spanish manner of dispatching the unfortunate animals by Jesus Solorzano and \\"Armillita,\\" noted matadors, and an exciting display of skill by Simao da Veiga, a famous \\"rejoneador.\\"Taken right in the \\"Plaza de Toros\\" of Mexico City, these views show Senhor da Veiga mounted on magnificent and highly trained horses, fixing \\"banderillas\\" into the shoulders of a ferocious and lively bull and finally putting an end to his torment with a single blow of a spearlike weapon called \\"rejon.\\" All without anybody but the destined victim suffering a scratch.The rest of this smoothly running picture, produced, directed and acted (mostly) by Ramon Pereda, in the role of a rural Robin Hood who turns out to be the legitimate heir to the rich, mining estate, is run-of-the-mine Mexican musical comedy romance.

The narrative at times is a little shaky, but as the interesting incidents fly by they defy one to quibble concerning their plausibility. Nevertheless, this film has been fashioned with all due regard for box office qualifications, and as it is never for an instant wearying, it will surely appeal to most persons who view it.No time is lost in stirring up interest in this photoplay","excerpt":"as, after the preliminary introduction of three characters in the South Seas, there is a sequence devoted to pearl divers under sea, going about their work while sharks dart back and forth. Soon Maurice Blake (Ronald Colman) and Philip Jardine, the wayward son of a San Francisco millionaire, quarrel on a small raft over a pearl. The two men flop into the water and are seen struggling under the surface. This is a decidedly effective stretch. Philip loses his life, and the exhausted Blake manages to swim ashore.Rosa Carmino, a woman of attractive appearance, informs Blake that she has received a letter for Jardine, asking the young man to return to his father. It contains $500 for his passage. Rosa knows all about Jardine, and as Blake is the same build, with dark hair, she prevails upon him to impersonate the other man.The two thieves, as they are alluded to in a subtitle, arrive in San Francisco, Rosa dreaming of a nice, comfortable little home. Here Mr. Fitzmaurice facetiously follows with the sight of the Jardine mansion, which at a casual glance might be mistaken for the Fifth Avenue Public Library. Blake is naturally nervous when he enters the Jardine home, and what adds to his fear is a police dog, which from his snarl detects Blake as an impostor, which gives the animal credit for remarkable intuition, seeing he had not been born when young Jardine lived with his parents.However, old Jardine is not skeptical. He wanted his son back, and yet he didn't. The boy had indirectly been the cause of his mother's death and the thought of this makes the old man wild with fury. He picks up a whip and lashes Blake, who stands there and takes the thrashing. Helen Saville, daughter of a neighbor, saves the situation by imploring Blake to stay, adding thot old Jardine had long been eager for his son to return. So Blake faces the music.After old Jardine relents, one is introduced to beautiful pictorial effects. There are Italian gardens, the lawns edged with marble and set off with playing fountains. Blake's situation then becomes more and more involved, especially when he falls in love with Helen, while Rosa rages with jealousy. Checks for large sums fall to Rosa to keep her quiet, but she is herself deeply infatuated with Blake. She gains admission to the Jardine home one evening as a dancer. It is a surprise to Blake, when he sees the story of the fight on the raft unfolded before him and then observes the fascinating Rosa emerge from a huge oyster shell arrayed in strings of pearls.The garden party on the Jardine estate is another extravagant affair. The two fathers are seen endeavoring to finish their favorite game—chess, while the younger element plays polo. The feature of this chapter is a polo game played by women in bathing suits. The guests are all the more thrilled by making it a contest between the blondes and the brunettes. Now this may be wandering away from the narrative, but who will say that such a game lacks interest? Moreover, Mr. Fitzmauriee has pictured the game in a spirited manner.Mr. Coleman, who has made no mean success on the screen since his appearance with Lillian Gish in \\"The White Sister,\\" gives an excellent performance in this fantastic story. Aileen Pringle impersonates the beautiful Rosa. Doris Kenyon figures as Helen Saville. She is extraordinarily sympathetic in happy situations, but her looks suffer in periods of disappointment and vexation. Claude Gillingwater is capable as old Jardine and Alec Francis is efficient in the minor rôle of the heroine's father.

Last week, the Manville Corporation, the largest asbestos producer in the country, omitted its quarterly dividend, and admitted for the first time that the continuing flood of asbestos litigation, which cost it $8.6 million in the first half of the year, was imperiling its financial health. Because it is impossible to estimate Manville's potential liability in the thousands of claims against it, the company's auditors have for two years qualified their opinion of Manville's annual report.   A week before Manville's announcement, the Chicago-based UNR Industries filed for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code, citing 17,000 claims against it related to asbestos pipe insulation it had not made since 1962. Since the beginning of 1980, the company has spent more than $26 million on asbestos litigation, according to David S. Leavitt, UNR's chairman and chief executive officer.

His best performances and recordings as a conductor have certainly been first rate. But so was Friday's recital. Indeed, it suggested that the best one can hope for with such a dual career -- that each facet enriches the other -- may have occurred now with Mr. Ashkenazy's pianism.

Her parents, her brother and even her grandfather are involved in Breanne's success.\\n\\nHer grandfather, Hickey Smith, drives Breanne to auditions in New York City several times a week and waits in the car while her mother, Denise Smith, dashes upstairs with Breanne and her brother, Connor, 4. They wait with dozens of other cute youngsters until Breanne's name is called for her audition, and then, if she lands the part, her father, Brian Smith, helps her memorize the script. \\n\\nSome of the reasons for Breanne's success are obvious. She is very outgoing. Small for her age, she can portray a child two years younger, a definite advantage in a profession where wisecracks from the mouths of babes seem in high demand.\\n\\nAnd she clearly loves to be the center of attention.\\n\\n\\"I'm never afraid -- I like to meet new people,\\" Breanne said, then struck a pose she has patented to wow casting directors. \\"Daddy says when I go into an interview just use my good looks and make my eyes roll.\\"\\nOvercoming Tears\\n\\n She was not always so poised, Mr. Smith said. Early in Breanne's acting career she became scared and cried at a few interviews when directors would take her into a room and ask her some preliminary questions about herself, he said.\\n\\nDemands are involved in the making of a celebrity. For instance, if there's a tryout, the Smiths must be ready to hop in the car at a moment's notice.\\n\\n\\"You can't make any plans,\\" Mrs. Smith said. \\"This is a full-time job.\\" She spoke in the living room of the family's modest home here, where pictures of the children line the walls, and a piano bought with the proceeds of one of Breanne's commercials takes up much of the room.\\n\\n\\"You also can't be depressed if you don't get chosen,\\" Mrs. Smith added. \\"I know people who go for a full year and get nothing.\\"\\n\\nThe Smiths postponed their vacation to Wildwood this summer when Breanne got a role in a television commercial for HIP, a health maintenance organization. There are dance, singing and piano lessons for her, and she must often do her homework in the car as she travels to and from auditions.\\n\\nMr. Smith is a police officer with a second job to make ends meet, but no matter how tired he is, when he comes home he helps his daughter run through lines for the next day's shoot. \\n\\nBreanne is considered a successful child actress, even though she lands only about five jobs out of some 200 auditions a year. She has been in commercials for Ivory and Shout detergents, Pepsi-Cola and Kix and Alphabet cereals. She played the doctor in a Jell-O Pudding Pops commercial, examining Bill Cosby.\\n\\nThe family earned a free trip to Orlando, Fla., for Breanne's part in a McDonald's commercial filmed at Disney World. Her squeaky voice has appeared in several radio ads, too. \\n\\nYet there are turndowns, plenty of them. Breanne said she was very sad when she was turned down for a toothpaste commercial that was to be filmed in Mexico because she would have taken her grandfather along as her escort as his birthday present.\\n\\nThe money isn't quite rolling in yet.\\n\\nAs a member of an actors' union, Breanne earns $466 for a day of work. That's not bad for someone almost 8, or almost anyone else, but it's not steady work. Also, 10 percent off the top goes to her agent and 15 percent to her manager. Except for buying the piano, Mr. Smith says he has been investing Breanne's earnings in a mutual fund that has been earmarked for college costs.\\nProblems in Earlier Effort\\n\\n After being burned for hundreds of dollars and no acting jobs by an unscrupulous modeling agency when Breanne was 3, the family signed with the Shirley Grant Management Agency of Teaneck, a children's talent company.\\n\\n\\"I knew right away that Breanne was special, just an adorable child,\\" said Shirley Grant, who owns the agency. \\"She's so bubbly and can converse with adults in an adult world. She'll go right to the top.\\"\\n\\nMrs. Grant also manages Keshia Knight Pulliam, who played Rudy on \\"The Cosby Show\\"","excerpt":"Ashlee Kevitch, who was Francie on television in \\"I'll Fly Away,\\" and Danny Tamberelli, who plays Little Pete on the Nickelodeon series \\"Pete and Pete.\\" \\n\\nWhat impact has Breanne's acting career had on the children at school?\\n\\n\\"Everybody likes it,\\" Breanne said. \\"Kids say, 'I saw you on TV,' and some older boys asked me for my autograph. My teacher said she thought she recognized me on a commercial for Shout, and I told her it was me but I had dirt all over my face.\\"\\n\\nStill, fame and recognition have not made Breanne universally loved. Some other mothers of aspiring actresses groan when Breanne goes into an audition, Mrs. Smith said, certain that she'll get the part over their daughters. Mrs. Smith said she often reassured them that Breanne would probably be turned down like most other children.\\n\\n\\"You can't make yourself crazy in this business,\\" Mrs. Smith said. \\"We try to keep our daughter a normal kid, into Brownies and gymnastics and activities like that. We don't want to be too competitive.\\" \\n\\nNow, young Connor Smith has been discovered. As he sat waiting for his older sister to come out of an audition one day recently, the husky little boy was asked to try out for a part in a Federal Express commercial. He got it in the one call. He also got a part, with nine other youngsters, in a child immunization commercial.\\n\\nConnor was happy to tell about the perks of his job.\\n\\n\\"I got to eat real cake, and I sang 'Happy Birthday' for three hours in that one,\\" he said.

[Page C1.]    Like the yule log, fruitcake and Christmas caroling, the holiday ritual of returning unwanted gifts continues to slip away. [C2.]    Michigan's Governor Turns to Toyota  In another era, Jennifer M. Granholm's courtship of Toyota would have been considered heresy for the governor of Michigan, where American automakers and their suppliers fueled the economic engine for decades. But with General Motors and the Ford Motor Company cutting thousands of jobs, the governor is vowing to ''go anywhere, do anything'' to find investment for her state. Ms. Granholm, having landed a $150 million Toyota design center earlier this year, now has her eyes on a potentially bigger prize: an engine plant that Toyota may build in the Midwest. [C1.]    Some United Automobile Workers members want a recount of a vote that narrowly approved an agreement between Ford Motor and the union, requiring workers and retirees to pay more for their health care. [C6.]    Tough Decisions Ahead on Pentagon Spending  As the Pentagon's budget faces tightening, it is redefining the strategic threats facing the United States and looking at weapons that are more high-tech, flexible and innovative. One big question, analysts say, is whether the Pentagon and Congress will be able to kill weapons programs where hundreds of billions of dollars -- as well as the careers of powerful generals and admirals -- are invested. [C1.]    As Winter Olympics Approach, So Do Endorsements  Michelle Kwan has never won an Olympic gold medal. But that has not stopped her from grabbing several long-term commercial endorsement deals that typically only go to those athletes who bring home the gold. As Ms. Kwan gears up for the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy -- the last chance for the 25-year-old figure skater -- she has already lined up major deals with Coca- Coca-Cola, Visa and East West Bank. But the choice of Ms. Kwan is unusual. For most athletes, a winning performance at the Olympics is essential -- turning gold into big money. [C1.]    Russia's Gazprom Wields New Influence  Gazprom is aspiring to join the ranks of energy majors like Exxon Mobil and BP, with the scope and bulk to operate worldwide. It is also a powerful instrument of Russia's emerging foreign policy doctrine, which rests on energy exports -- and the power and prestige they bring -- in place of lost military might. An effort to overhaul Gazprom is spurred, analysts say, by a growing stake in the company among the Moscow elite, who have invested heavily in Gazprom stock. President Vladimir V. Putin, above, installed new management at the company, including Aleksei Miller, the chief executive, and as chairman, Dmitry Medvedev, who is also a deputy prime minister. [C1.]    Internet Is a Boon to Independent Music Companies  Exploiting online message boards, music blogs and social networks, independent music companies are making big advances at the expense of the four global music conglomerates, whose business model of blockbuster hits promoted through radio airplay now looks increasingly outdated. [E1.]    European Regulators Crack Down on Cartels  Across Europe, formerly docile cartel authorities are cracking down on collusion in economically weighty sectors like telecommunications, construction and banking. The drive includes tougher national and continental investigations as well as fines that are nearing 1 billion euros. [C3.]    Estonia Aims to Become a Global Shipping Lure  Tiit Vahi, a former Estonian prime minister, wants to transform a place once nicknamed Uranium Lake into a bustling commercial port, with the aim of allowing Estonia to shake up European trade. [C3.]    Influx of Immigrants Causes Concern in Ireland  An outpouring of support for more than 500 unionized workers of Irish Ferries, who will be replaced by new workers, mainly from Latvia, who will work for less than half Ireland's minimum wage, is raising questions about whether the tolerance for globalization that helped bolster the Irish economy is waning.

And meandering through the streets of Richmond is like stepping into the pages of a history book, from the neo-Classical domed Capitol designed by Thomas Jefferson to Shockoe Slip, a warehouse district that was ravaged by fire during the Civil War and is now a lively jumble of boutiques and bistros.\\n\\nRichmond is a city awash in green, from the maple- and oak-lined medians of Monument Avenue -- an elegant, 130-foot-wide boulevard studded with statues of Confederate heroes -- to the petite gardens fringing the Fan district's Victorian brownstones and pastel row houses. On warm Sunday afternoons, flower vendors dot the streets and couples meander through the city's more than 60 parks.\\n\\nOne of the year's most eagerly awaited events is Historic Garden Week, April 22 to 29, a statewide tour of houses and gardens.

But in these more economically stringent times, the studios have sharply cut the number of deals they hand out, and many of the survivors have proved themselves to be more than vanity projects. While Tom Cruise's deal cost Paramount Pictures up to $10 million a year, the typical pact provides $500,000 to $2 million for office overhead and additional sums for discretionary use, including the purchase of a script or the rights to a book. In return, the studio gets the right of first refusal on any projects developed by the production company.

I found a wonderful restaurant in Chioggia: the Trattoria Buon Pesce on the Stradele Ponte Canera right off the Corso del Popolo. Here one can pass a couple of hours having a really good lunch for not much money. The seafood risotto was without equal.   After lunch I would recommend a short visit to San Domenico where you can see the last painting Carpaccio ever did in Venice: his portrait of St. Paul. It's fun to get there, walking quay-side as the fishing boats return to port followed by massive clouds of vociferous gulls.    Another excellent restaurant, hidden away on Murano, is Busa alla Torre da LeLe. The restaurant is at the top of the main glass-selling street of Murano across from the Church of St. Peter Martyr in the Campo Santo Stefano just under the bell tower that gives it its name.   A companion and I left it to the owner to select the menu for us. The feast that ensued lasted a good three hours and ranged from sea-fresh capparoselli clams to a wonderful porcini pasta dish to impeccable John Dory and veal cutlet Orechiette Milanese. On a return visit, we dined on the tiniest of crabs, each no larger than a thumbnail, deep fried and eaten whole.   If you go, don't sit outside or in the bar area","excerpt":"ask to be seated in the dark panelled room at the back on the left.

HASTERT: Well, thank you very much for everybody showing up today. I'm sorry -- you know, when you talk about the page issue and what's happened in the Congress, I'm deeply sorry that this has happened. And the bottom line is that we're taking responsibility, because ultimately, as someone has said in Washington before: The buck stops here. For something like this to occur, our system obviously isn't designed for the electronic age of Instant Messages. When the Congress found out about the explicit messages, Republicans dealt with it immediately and the culprit was gone. We are now trying to correct the problem. We've asked the Ethics Committee to look into this matter and we asked for criminal investigations to be opened by the Justice Department, the FBI and the State of Florida. We have a toll-free number where people can confidently call. And we've reached out to experts around the country to put a system in place to make sure this never happens again. The tip number is 1-866-384-0481. We will do everything possible to make the program safe for the kids while they're in our care in Washington, D.C. And we will make sure that we can be a resource for their parents once they return home. We're looking for a person of high caliber to advise us on the page program. I reached out to the Democrat leader and shared with her some of the ideas and we hope to resolve this soon. Final point: Our children need to be protected. And we're going to do everything we can to protect them. I'll take some questions. QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE) HASTERT: On that point, I only know what I've seen in the press and what I've heard. There's no ultimate, real source of information, but that's what I've read. And that's what I've heard in the press. And so the fact is: We've turned this whole thing over to the FBI for us to try to find out what happened. And that's what we want to do. And any member of Congress that is involved in this or any staffer needs to comply and the results will be there. QUESTION: Mr. Speaker, will you set the record straight on a couple of things? Tell us once again, if you will, when you learned that there was more than a minor problem (OFF-MIKE) something that had a predatory feel to it (OFF-MIKE)? HASTERT: I, first of all, learned of this last Friday, when we were about to leave Congress for the break, to go out and campaign. And that's the first time that I heard of the explicit language. When it happened, Republicans acted. And the guy's gone. But the fact is that I don't know who knew what, when. We know that there are reports of people that knew it and, kind of, fed it out or leaked it to the press. That's why we've asked for an investigation. So let me just say -- that's why we've asked for an investigation: to find who that is. If it's members of my staff that didn't do the job, we will act appropriately. If it's somebody else's staff, they ought to act appropriately as well. QUESTION: Nobody's admitted it to you? No one in your own staff has acknowledged knowing the seriousness of the problem, one, two or three years ago and, certainly, no one told you about it? HASTERT: No. QUESTION: And, if they didn't, were they derelict? HASTERT: I didn't hear the rest of your question. QUESTION: Were they derelict, Mr. Speaker, if they didn't let you know what was going on? HASTERT: Well, my staff has been -- if somebody didn't let us know, then there's a problem. And I think the investigation will find that out. QUESTION: How were the e-mails characterized? How were they characterized? Were they just overly friendly ? Not only as the speaker, but as a former teacher, did that not ring any alarms to you... HASTERT: We were advised -- our office and then the clerk's office and to the chairman of the page board that there was a Katrina message, period. We knew of no other e-mails -- we -- in that system. And there were no other e-mails other than that one that I know of. And we didn't even have the e-mail because the parents didn't want to give the e-mail out. They said, Stop it. The guy that I asked to do that job a long time ago was John Shimkus. John Shimkus is an Army ranger. He's a tough guys. He goes right to the point when there's a problem. He confronted the member. And the member said that he would stop doing that","excerpt":"asked if there was any other messages. He said no. And he said, Don't do it again. You know, that's what we did. The parents were happy. Could we have done it better? Could the Page Board have handled it better? In retrospect, probably, yes. But at that time, what we knew and what we acted upon was what we had. QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE) HASTERT: You know, it's interesting: Kirk Fordham also said just about three or four days ago that he worked for this guy for 10 years and he never did anything wrong. So there's a little bit of difference in the testimony or what he said. QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE) HASTERT: I'm going to run, and presumably win, in this election. And when we do, I expect to run for leader -- for speaker. And, you know, I think everybody else will too. But our members ultimately make that decision. QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE) HASTERT: Well, ultimately, any time that a person has to, as a leader, be on the hot seat and he is a detriment to the party, you know, there ought to be a change. I became speaker in a situation like that. I don't think that's the case. I said I haven't done anything wrong, obviously. And we need to come back. What we need to do is start talking about the issues. We have a great economy. It's because of Republican tax cuts and Republican handling of the economy, of holding the line on spending. We have addressed the war on terror. We've done that continually over the last five years, and today we have a pretty safe America. And, you know, a lot of people wanted us to address the issue about the border, and we did exactly that. And, you know, last Friday, we culminated in appropriations that did fix the border. So, you know, we have a good story to tell. Our friends on the other side of the aisle really don't have a story to tell. And maybe they're resolving to another way to -- to -- another political tactic. Thank you very much.
