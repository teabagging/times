The films' points of view may be vague on occasion, but they constitute pictorial records that tug at the heart and stir the mind.Danny Lyon, the 32-year-old film maker and still photographer responsible for \\"Children,\\" who was represented here in 1973 by documentaries on New Mexican Indians and others, again seems to be less concerned with polished technique than with an obvious empathy for his pitiable principals. Filmed last year in eye-catching color, reportedly in Santa Marta, his subjects are, mostly, a group of boys who personalize the will to survive.The off-screen narration and subtitles call for fuller explanations, but it is clear that the children have been abandoned or simply left their families to join one of many groups of hardy derelicts who beg for the scraps they eat, wheel and deal, sleep, play and wander through the raucous streets or beach or stream they call home.If the film tends to digress on variations on similar themes or for vignettes of teen-age prostitutes, it does expose its largely laconic children in sequences that often speak louder than words. Ranging in age from preteen, pixieish Joselin to dour, teen-aged Ivan, crudely chanting songs about their tribulations, they are seen sleeping on the steps of the city's cathedral or under the compassionate gaze of the Christ figure in its vaulted interior","excerpt":"snagging leftovers from a restaurant or nibbling chicken claws roasted on a city lot; playing games and building sand castles.In illustration of their seeming aimlessness, one blond boy says flatly that he didn't know his father and that he came to the city on a train.

The documentation of their errant life-style may be diffuse, but it strikingly illustrates, as Mr. Lyon states in a program note, \\"the absolute lower end of survival on the yardstick of human existence.\\"\\"In the Street,\\" oddly enough, is having its first theatrical showing since it was produced in 1952 by Helen Levitt, Janice Loeb and the late James Agee, who, in 1948, collaborated on the memorable drama of a troubled Harlem boy in \\"The Quiet One.\\" The East Harlem they picture in \\"In the Street\\" is benign \\"theater and battleground,\\" especially in the vitality of the carefree Latin and black children pelting one another with flour sacks or gazing pensively from tenement windows.

Those searching for inventive ways to avoid turning up the thermostat can look to homes in England, where an inordinate amount of energy goes into staying warm. In large country houses, for example, heavy velvet curtains -- or portieres, as they are called -- are hung from brass rods and form puddles on the floor. Strategically placed over doorways, they have been a classic solution to keeping out drafts.   In this country, manufacturers are beginning to produce all kinds of warming accouterments. Some, like the tea warmers and thermal coffee makers shown here, are updated versions of old standbys meant to make life a bit cozier. Others, like space heaters and foot warmers, are effective, if limited, new ways to cut fuel costs. Space heaters, for example, run on electricity and can be used, as their name suggests, to heat a small space rather than an entire room. And these electrical warming devices, says Harold M. McShane, manager of the Con Edison Conservation Center in New York City, \\"are not at all dangerous, providing the wiring in the walls is good.\\"   Aside from the obvious ways to keep heat in a home -- installing storm windows, putting covers on air conditioners -- McShane suggests taking a careful look at the furniture arrangement. If a sofa is blocking a baseboard heater, for instance, move it. Curtains, though they prevent drafts, can also block incoming heat. And while a roaring fire may make a home seem toasty, the chimney allows warm air to escape. \\"If all else fails,\\" McShane says, \\"you can always put on an extra sweater.\\" Design","excerpt":"SNUGGLE UP"},{"year":"1995","title":"Anyone who has snuggled into a terry cloth robe after a shower or a swim knows how comfortable, not to mention practical, the fabric is.

So he must go to work for the local miller, an aged citizen, whose fair daughter he wins by the classic method of \\"treating her rough.\\"The mill breaks down at the right moment and the miller has no money to pay for repairs. Stepan calls a town meeting, which decides to get a loan to build a model communal mill, of which Stepan, of course, beomes manager and President of the local Soviet to boot.None Too Well Received.This trite story of \\"getting there\\" is appropriately interspersed with hair-raising plots by the powers of darkness, reaction and private trade to destroy our young Red hero, who is fortunate to be on the winning side throughout and so lives happily ever after.That is what the Administration would certainly like to see happening everywhere, and Leon Trotsky and his confederates of the Opposition got themselves disliked by their former comrades for saying it is not—for asserting, in fact, that is is precisely the tough \\"koulak,\\" the richer peasant type, to which the old miller in \\"The Millrace\\" belongs, who is gaining ground in the Russian village today.However that may be, Moscow film fans are now so saturated with propaganda of all sorts that they are taking none too kindly to \\"The Millrace,\\" despite its perfect technique and glorious landscapes. But they are crowding to see straight adventure stories like \\"The Three Musketeers,\\" with Douglas Fairbanks and Adolphe Menjou, for which all tickets are sold out weeks in advance, being eagerly bought from theatre door touts at thrice the box-office price.Peasants Hoarding Money.Just as Jacques, the French peasant, has or used to have his bas de laine (woolen stocking) stuffed full with écus or five-franc pieces, often with a respectable number of golden louis among them, so Ivan Ivanitch (John, son of John), his Russian counterpart, keeps a vodka bottle in which, after three good, harvests, his hoard of silver ten-kopeck pieces has nearly reached neck level.Despite Leon Tolstoy, like all other peasants, Ivan has a touch of the realist who knows the bargaining power this little hoard gives him, and intends to force up the grain price to its real exchange value in terms of manufactured articles, and if he cannot get his price for his grain he will feed it to his pigs and poultry, turn it into samogan moonlight liquor and keep a substantial reserve in case the next harvest fails.And the extra trickle of goods which is being deflected from Moscow's depleted stores to the equally depleted village cooperatives is much too feeble to turn him from his purpose.Peasants' Lottery Loan.But if Ivan need not hurry, the Soviet State must, in order to obtain grain for its export needs. Moscow has been discussing how to get hold of the silver contents of that vodka bottle, and is now floating a \\"peasants' lottery loan\\" for 100,000,000 rubles, redeemable Feb. 1, 1931, with various most ingenious devices to persuade Ivan to subscribe to it.Here the method adopted of getting the disciplined city proletarian voting mass to take up loans in factory or trade union group meetings is clearly inapplicable, so small bonds of from 2½ to 10 rubles will be issued, bearing interest at 6 per cent., with one chance in thirty of winning prizes ranging from 50 to 1,000 rubles, which will be paid in agricultural machinery if required.One-fifth of the total capital is thus set aside as prize money, but the cleverest inducement of all is this: One-tenth of the total subscribed in each village will not take the road to Moscow, but be actually left in the hands of the village Soviet to spend as it desires on \\"local improvements.\\"The local authorities will thus, for instance, decide near whose houses a new well will be sunk, a new road be made or a new mill or school be built, and it is unnecessary to emphasize what this means not only as an inducement to subscribe to the loan, but as a political weapon on the eve of the new Soviet elections.Accord With Church Seen.Massive loan, propaganda will be broadcast in every village of the Soviet Union. Village teachers and officials will be instructed to go and get subscribers, and the village priest also may soon be telling his flock that it is his sacred duty to show loyalty to the established régime by buying its bonds.For there are signs that an unnatural but quite feasible concordat between the Orthodox Russian Church and the materialistic Soviet State, mooted in August in a pastoral letter by \\"Acting Patriarch\\" Sergei, Metropolitan of Novgorod, is approaching realization.Last night, at a packed meeting in the Conservatoire Concert Hall, ten very handsome old men, with flowing locks and the longest, whitest and glossiest beards left in this now shaven land (all the Archbishops are lieutenants of the Primate Sergei), sat on the platform while Kuznietzof, a former Professor of Canon Law at St. Petersburg, unfolded the theory of the \\"divine right\\" to rule of all sufficiently consolidated de facto Governments, which was strangely reminiscent of the views expressed by the famous \\"Vicar of Bray\\" in the old song.With the approval of the \\"Acting Synod\\" (constituted by Sergei last May with the Soviet Government's permission). Kuznietzof exhorted the audience, clergy and laity alike, to \\"render unto Caeser the things that are Caesar's,\\" and plainly hinted that the Soviet \\"Caesar\\" was likely to give something substantial in return.It may be that some further pronouncement on the possibility of reviving Church councils will be issued by Sergei and his Acting Synod on Saturday, which is the Orthodox Russian Christmas.

Forster wrote many years ago. The advice applies, surprisingly enough, to comedians. In a prime-time special last season, Jerry Seinfeld paid tribute to Abbott and Costello, whose goofy antics might seem miles away from the cerebral whinings of Seinfeld. But take away the broad pratfall humor and stick with the verbal games, the \\"who's on first\\" routines, and it is blazingly apparent that Seinfeld's conversational gyrations owe much to the classic Abbott and Costello routines.         The past has a habit of clinging to us in the most unexpected places. Latest  example: \\"Kelsey Grammer Salutes Jack Benny,\\" on NBC at 10 this evening. As \\"Frasier,\\" Mr. Grammer at first glance may seem to have little in common with Jack Benny, the vaudeville comic who created the immortal character who always lied about his age, played a good violin badly and gave new meaning to the word  \\"cheap.\\" But watch Mr. Grammer closely for the deadpan reactions, the pomposity  that is always being deflated hilariously, the uses of silence as a punch line.  Mr. Benny was obviously an influence. And it would be hard to think of a better  one.

There are trapeze artists, elephants, balloons, a caliope and a certain amount of the sentimental haze of sawdust that belongs—in screen shows, at least—with two rings and a platform. \\"Swing High,\\" as an epic of the circus life, does feel the lack, however, of Dexter Fellows. He and certain other things.Not unlike the general run of such tales, the persons who contributed most to this one are trapeze artists. Philosophers could probably explain it","excerpt":"so could cynics. The latter would point out quietly that a trapeze artist is about the only circus performer who can slip, fall, break a shoulder, go to the hospital and finally hurry back to the show in order to save the hero from an ignominious term in the local jail. It has happened before; it has happened most recently in \\"Swing High.\\"The story opens with Pop Garner's \\"Circus Supreme\\" marching into town trailed by Doo May's medicine show. This latter, besides dealing with medicine, proudly possesses a tenor. Things—and tenors—being what they are, it isn't long before the current ukulele strummer meets up with the girl. The triangle, or coincidence, or dramatic situation or whatever it is, is completed by the fact that the girl is the daughter of \\"Pop\\"; is, in addition to that, his main aerolist.While the young couple are busily engaged in falling in love to the tune of the calliope, the German band and a gang of Negro stake-drivers singing spirituals, the pair of villains appears. The male half of it works in the box office—always a good place for either a hero or villain—and his partner joins Maryan on the trapeze. Trixie, for that is her name, has more designs on the show's funds than on Garry, but she will do practically anything while waiting for the cash to grow large enough to make it worth while.Along about here there is a game of poker in Trixie's dressing room. Maryan comes in unexpectedly and is surprised to find her fiancé in the arms of another. Surprised is perhaps a bit weak, but anyway the effect is the same. She goes to her trapeze, falls from it and is carried to the hospital. Garry broods about it, drinks some, gambles some, and a few weeks later manages to lose the circus funds while taking them to the bank. The Sheriff arrests him.Then comes Maryan's moment. She leaves the white cot in the silent room and goes back to the circus. Suspecting that Trixie has had something to do with it, she waits until they are on the trapeze together. There, threatening to shake her partner from the rope, she discovers that Trixie's pet monkey has been the thief. So everything ends happily.George Fawcett, as Pop Garner, does well in a rôle that is not particularly important, and Chester Conklin has another small bit as the Sheriff. Helen Twelvetrees has the rôle of Maryan, and Fred Scott is the tenor with the ukulele. Dorothy Burgess is Trixie and Ben Turpin and Bryant Washburn have the unimportant parts of bartender and ringmaster. Time passes.
