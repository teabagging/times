Because of construction and delays, passengers heading for the airport should set out earlier than they normally would because of detours and construction delays, suggests William Fife, manager of the redevelopment program.   The major goals of the project, scheduled to be completed by mid-1992, are expansion and modernization of the central terminal building, reconfiguration of the airport's roadway system and construction of a new passenger terminal at the east end of the airport.   \\"Conditions will get a little worse before they get better,\\" says Mr. Fife. \\"We encourage the use of public transportation to get out to the airport during the renovation,\\" he says, \\"but if you do take a car spend more time looking at the signs -- because the shapes of the roadways are different than before.\\"   The central terminal building is being made 55 feet longer for expanded baggage claim areas, extra circulation space for passengers and new restaurant facilities and amenities. On the upper level, the number of lanes for dropoffs are being doubled to help alleviate some of the congestion on the roadways leading into La Guardia.   The new terminal will be for passengers of Continental and Eastern airlines.   This new $162 million facility is part of the plan by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which runs the city's airports, to decentralize La Guardia's terminal facilities, redistribute passengers and relieve congestion in the central terminal area.   Information on public transportation to and from La Guardia, Kennedy or Newark is available by calling 800-247-7433.  London Begins Chunnel Station     Work has started on Britain's first international railroad terminal, Waterloo International, in London, where completion is scheduled to coincide with the opening of the Channel Tunnel in 1993.   According to British Rail plans, trains will depart every hour for both Paris (a three-hour journey) and Brussels (11 minutes more).    Waterloo International is being built as a separate terminal within the site of the existing Waterloo Station.   High-speed trains, with one power car at each end, plus 18 intermediate passenger coaches, will transport passengers at speeds up to 185 miles per hour, making it possible, a British Rail official said, to leave your office in the heart of London and arrive in Paris or Brussels in time for late dinner.  U.S. Warning On Fez Violence    The State Department has advised Americans contemplating traveling to Morocco, particularly Fez, to check with the Department or the American Embassy in Rabat for an update on the situation there after violent demonstrations the weekend of Dec. 14-15.   Tourists fled when the Des Merinides Hotel in Fez was set afire during riots following the start of a nationwide general strike. Violence erupted in other cities, including Tangier and Rabat, but it was most widespread in Fez, the country's religious and intellectual center. The city suffered extensive damage as thousands of people rampaged through the streets, looters ransacked jewelry stores, banks and public buildings and rioters set buses and cars on fire and burned the 90-room hotel. The violence, which was prompted, according to diplomats, by hunger, poverty and unemployment, was followed by a pledge by the Moroccan Government to raise salaries, improve social benefits and resume talks with unions and employers to resolve labor disputes. Estimates of the number of people killed in Fez varied","excerpt":"union officials put the number at about 35, including some soldiers. AIR-TRAIN PLAN FROM AMTRAK    Amtrak and United Airlines are offering packages that permit travel one way by rail and return by air. Travelers will save about 30 percent off the regular one-way fares for each leg. Reservations for the new program begin on Wednesday.   Christopher D. Bowers, a United vice president, said the cost of the plan's packages will help overcome resistance by travelers -- because of high one-way fares -- to taking trips by air one way and by rail the other. One-way fares are the highest in the transportation business, he said.   For example, a round trip (train and plane or plane and train) under the plan between Los Angeles and New York will cost $419 a person in off-peak months and $499 during peak, which is May 24 to Sept. 16 and the Christmas-New Year's period. The regular train fare between the two cities is $307 one way.  The package, called the Amtrak Air-Rail Travel Plan, will also allow travelers to fly to a city served by United, journey around the region by rail and fly home from the same United city.      The plan may be used for trans-Continental trips or regional travel between Amtrak and United destinations in the Continental United States, except Alaska. Generally, the plan allows one-way air and one-way rail between two of four zones -- the West, Mountain States, Midwest and East. It also permits two \\"regional tours.\\" One combines the East Zone with one of five Midwestern and Western cities: Minneapolis-St. Paul, Omaha, Kansas City, Dallas/Fort Worth and Houston; the other links the West Zone with Chicago and New Orleans. Other price examples: for travel between Midwest and West, $369 and $399 in peak; Midwest-Florida, $299 and $349, and East-Mountain States, $399 and $439. The regional tour combining the East and five cities costs $419 and $489. The regional tour linking the West with Chicago or New Orleans is $359 and $389.   Reservations from Jan. 2: (800) 872-7245. ART BRIGHTENS WALLS OF PARIS PARIS    Paris has blossomed with a new art form. Vivid, eye-catching paintings and metal sculptures brighten dead, windowless walls in a program organized by the city urban mangement office. The city encourages artists to submit ideas, and a wall commmitee that includes neighborhood property owners, votes on the works. The project was started by the Mayor, Jacques Chirac, in 1981 to brighten the many walls left bare when neighboring buildings disappeared during the creation of boulevards and squares beginning in the 19th century.   On a towering blank wall next to a fire station at 20 Rue St.-Fargeau (20th arrondissement), a mosaic depicts a fireman climbing a ladder to rescue a small black plaster cat marooned atop the real wall.  Across from the Pompidou Museum at Rue Quincampoix and Rue Aubry-le-Boucher (4th arrondissement), strollers smile at four trompe l'oeil windows giving them a glimpse of a bird, romping children and a man playing a violin. At 58 Rue du Louvre (2d arrondissement) a giant Mona Lisa crafted from metal shimmers far above pedestrians hurrying past.    One of the largest paintings is at 103 Quai Branly (15th arrondissement), blanketing a wall bared when bulldozers leveled old buildings to construct the Eiffel Tower. Labeled \\"They Made the 20th Century,\\" the wall is packed with the faces of 477 newsmakers from Albert Einstein to Judy Garland. A 14-story windowless wall at 182 Rue Nationale (13th arrondissement) glows with a cinnamon-colored door opening seductively onto a blue sea and crimson sky.   The city pays an artist $2,000 for the model of an approved design and in some cases another $8,000 in prize money on condition that he or she supervise the transfer of the work to the wall by craftsmen.    The Direction de l'Amenagement Urbain, 17 Boulevard Morland, 75004 Paris -- near the Sully-Morland subway stop -- can provide the addresses of the 73 rejuvenated walls. -- ALINE MOSBY Travel Advisory"},{"year":"1977","title":"NYS Sup Ct Justice Irwin Brownstein issues injunction enjoining LIRR trainmen and conductors from striking on grounds that walkout violates NYS Taylor Law","excerpt":"union officials Raymond Mills and Lou Duro and MTA chmn Fisher comment (M) CourtBars L.I.R.R.Strike,but Union May Defy Ban"},{"year":"1943","title":"gen strike threat grows","excerpt":"union officials refuse compromise in dues dispute; govt com asks Maj W W Inglis, operators conf chmn, to hold 50c dues increase in escrow pending settlement; Kennedy scores plan; Hazelton miners vote to strike for wage increase HARD COAL MINERS CONTINUE STRIKE, SHORTAGE GROWS; Local Leaders at Wilkes-Barre Refuse to Sanction Return to Work Today TO MEET AGAIN TUESDAY Acute Situation Confronts New York, With Reserves of the Domestic Sizes Exhausted HARD COAL MINERS CONTINUE STRIKE"},{"year":"1977","title":"bank officials say they are optimistic that solution to avert bankruptcy for city can be worked out","excerpt":"union officials reiterate opposition to stringent financial controls that banks are demanding (M) BANKERS OPTIMISTIC ON FISCAL SOLUTION; UNIONS SCORE TERMS"},{"year":"1936","title":"F A Silcox begins wage arbitration discussions with union and Realty Bd reprs","excerpt":"union officials replace strikers who walk out from bldg refusing to reinstate 6 active in last strike ARBITRATION BEGUN ON SERVICE WAGES; Silcox Meets With Union and Realty Spokesmen on Demand for $8 a Month Rise."},{"year":"1974","title":"Netherland Foreign Ministry official says Arab oil embargo is not very effective since oil is coming into country through 3d parties","excerpt":"union officials rept 12.5% more oil arriving in port during 1st wk of Jan than mo earlier (S) THE DUTCH RATION GASOLINE FOR CARS"},{"year":"1941","title":"United Cement, Lime and Gypsum workers vote strike, Pa, N J, N Y and Md","excerpt":"union officials rept cooling-off period to avert strike under consideration Cement Union May \\"Cool Off\\""},{"year":"1946","title":"Operating Engineers Union picket lines close Dow Chem Co plants, Freeport, Tex","excerpt":"union officials rept union shop question stymies negotiations 6,000 OUT OF JOBS IN CHEMICAL STRIKE"},{"year":"1926","title":"W Green, Pres of A F of L, says, in reply to J Jones' statement that only $1,000 was received by British miners from U S, that more than $50,000 was contributed by affiliated unions and sent to A J Cook, Sec-Treas of British Miners' Fed","excerpt":"union officials say $100,000 was collected in U S for striking miners $100,000 SENT TO STRIKERS; Green Gives Amount -- Most of It Said to Have Gone to Reds."},{"year":"1921","title":"TRUCKMEN READY TO QUIT.","excerpt":"Union Officials Say 1,000 Men Await Walkout Tomorrow."},{"year":"1929","title":"Signs contract with union of subway workers BRONX STRIKE STOPS WORK ON SUBWAY","excerpt":"Union Officials Say 800 Men Are Out, but Employers Put the Total at 600.

That option, unavailable to the Democrats, was seized on election night by the Union Pacific Corporation, which appeared to be all but certain to lose the pending election for control of the Santa Fe Pacific Corporation.   Union Pacific's latest bid in the contest with Burlington Northern Inc. for railroad supremacy in the West offered to assume all risk that Federal regulators would turn the merger down. It is willing, it said on Tuesday night, to pay for Santa Fe shares now and, if forced to do so, dispose of them later. Santa Fe shareholders would face no risk.   But -- and this is where this election battle gets complex -- Union Pacific is also willing to pay a higher price if it doesn't have to bear that risk. And while it initiated its tender offer last night, it imposed conditions that mean it could withdraw the offer. It is at least possible that Santa Fe shareholders who will vote next week on the Burlington Northern offer could turn it down and then not be able to get anything from Union Pacific for years, if at all.   That risk obviously was not on the minds of traders yesterday who bid up Santa Fe shares, which rose $1.25, to $16, on the New York Stock Exchange. Union Pacific fell $2 a share, to $47.50, while Burlington Northern, after rising early, ended unchanged at $49.375. The market clearly thinks that Union Pacific will likely prevail with its new offer. And it suspects it is overpaying.   Burlington Northern denounced the new Union Pacific offer, but said nothing to rule in or out the possibility of improving its own bid. \\"In an effort to avoid an effective competitor, U.P. has now put its shareholders in a risky and vulnerable position,\\" Gerald Grinstein, Burlington's chairman and chief executive, said.    The unusually complex takeover fight for Santa Fe reflects the fact that approval by the Interstate Commerce Commission is needed before the railroads can merge. But there is nothing to stop one company from buying the other before the commission acts. The mechanism for doing that is the voting trust, in which the railroads are kept separate even while under common ownership.   That is what Union Pacific proposed on Tuesday. If the merger eventually is viewed as anticompetitive, Union Pacific would then have to dispose of Santa Fe, perhaps taking a sizable loss.   Santa Fe shareholders will vote Nov. 18 on the Burlington Northern offer of Burlington stock now valued at $16.79 a share. That offer cannot be completed without the commission's approval, but Santa Fe officials believe that approval would be forthcoming. They say a Union Pacific takeover would present a much more difficult hurdle because of the higher number of parallel routes that would be combined.   Prior to Tuesday night, Union Pacific had offered $20 a share in Union Pacific stock, contingent on shareholders rejecting the Burlington deal. Union Pacific had rejected a voting trust proposal, instead citing its own experts who argued that the commission would approve a deal. Effectively, Santa Fe's institutional holders said they did not want to take the chance, and suggested that Union Pacific put its money where its mouth was.   At first glance, that appears to be exactly what Union Pacific has done. It is now offering $17.50 in cash and stock for each Santa Fe share, but with a voting trust that will enable it to act without commission approval. It is taking that plan to Santa Fe shareholders through a tender offer.   But Union Pacific has left itself some escape clauses. Though the tender offer goes directly to the shareholders, it is contingent on approval of the Santa Fe board, as well as on shareholder rejection of the Burlington Northern offer.   Why make a hostile offer contingent on board approval? \\"We need their cooperation with the I.C.C.,\\" said Gary Schuster, a spokesman for Union Pacific. \\"We can waive that if we want to, but we probably won't.\\"   Moreover, even in saying it would go to the shareholders, Union Pacific said it remained ready to make a deal on its previous terms, which offer more money but shift the risk of the commission's disapproval to Santa Fe shareholders, who would have to wait, perhaps for years, to see any cash.
