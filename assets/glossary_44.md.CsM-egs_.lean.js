But what happens if that apparently paradoxical process is jettisoned? That's one of the questions raised by ''AN OAK TREE,'' in which the British ''theater maker'' TIM CROUCH plays a provincial stage hypnotist whose act derails when he summons an audience volunteer. It's not just that the volunteer turns out to be the father of a girl the hypnotist has killed in a car accident. It's also that he is played by a different, unrehearsed actor at every performance.    This is neither improvisation (every line is set) nor audience participation","excerpt":"actors playing the father are engaged in advance and paid Equity minimum -- about $80. They may be male or female, of any age or type, but are cast only if they have not seen the show or read the script beforehand. Their lines and stage directions are provided via an earpiece, on a clipboard or directly by Mr. Crouch.    The conjuring of identity in a context of uncertainty -- not knowing what's happening or where it will lead -- is a longstanding theme of modern art (and life). The play gets its name from a 1973 installation by the sculptor Michael Craig-Martin, who put a glass of water on a shelf and declared that it was an oak tree, not merely a symbol of one. Onstage, the representational hocus-pocus should be even more resonant. All art is fakery; in the theater, the fakes talk.    Still, the role of the father is an actor's nightmare come true, and who would volunteer for that? Well, F. MURRAY ABRAHAM, among others. He is scheduled to play the father at the Oct. 30 performance. Or will it be a glass of water claiming to be F. Murray Abraham?

At the same theater, as Fanny Farrelly in ''Watch on the Rhine,'' she was very proper and very naive politically. At the Darien Dinner Theater, where she played the medium, Madame Arcati, in the musical ''High Spirits,'' she was a dotty eccentric. And then there's always Madge, the television manicurist of Palmolive commercials. Madge is open, goodhearted and tough.   But none of these is the offstage Jan Miner - warm, fun, fairly soft-spoken and continuously bubbling with laughter.
