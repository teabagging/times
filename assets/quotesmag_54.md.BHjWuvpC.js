For serious new American theater on Broadway, the play to see is David Mamet's ''Glengarry Glen Ross,'' at the John Golden, 45th Street, west of Broadway (239- 6200). It is a brilliant and frequently scatological comedy about the cutthroat tactics, tribal language and emotional anguish of a band of ruthless Chicago real-estate salesmen. For classic American theater on Broadway, there is the new revival of Eugene O'Neill's last completed play, ''A Moon for the Misbegotten,'' at the Cort, 138 West 48th Street (239-6200). Kate Nelligan's overwhelming performance as Josie Hogan plunges the audience directly to the heart of O'Neill's tragic vision of love and death on a Connecticut farm of 1923.

That may seem like a strange if not lunatic thing to say hard on the heels of the successful openings of the Milos Forman-Peter Shaffer screen adaptation of Mr. Shaffer's ''Amadeus,'' the Norman Jewison- Charles Fuller screen adaptation of Mr. Fuller's Pulitzer Prize-winning ''Soldier's Play,'' retitled ''A Soldier's Story,'' and Francesco Rosi's surprisingly cinematic ''Bizet's Carmen,'' which is nothing less than a full-scale screen opera.   Yet the success of each of these films calls attention to the fact that the best American playwrights, as well as all serious playwrights everywhere, are increasingly committed to the creation of a kind of stage literature that is complete unto itself, which cannot easily be adapted to the needs of the screen without compromising the particular art of the original.    These playwrights, including Mr. Shaffer, understand the theater to be a kind of prison, but one whose severe restrictions - whose unrealities - make possible a kind of language you will respond to nowhere else. It's a place where the audience becomes an active participant in the exercise of the playwright's imagination, and where artifice, instead of being exhausting, as it can be in movies, is liberating.

Instead, 15 models appeared in malachite and amethyst leathers, cashmeres, coats, jumpsuits, even a reversible satin trenchcoat in this sophisticated color mix. There was a new mood at Montana. From that sophisticated opening, he moved quickly into a luxurious sportswear group in butter-pecan whipcord, flannel and cashmere for ankle- length coats, oversize sweaters and pleated pants that flopped on the shoes.

It is Tyrone Guthrie's staging of it in the motion picture form, with the Stratford (Ont.) Shakespearean Festival players declaiming the roles.This film, produced by Leonid Kipnis, opened at the Fifty-fifth Street Playhouse yesterday.The most striking aspect of it, after one recognizes the fact that this is a literal performance of the drama within the compass of a single platform stage, is a theatrical aberration: the actors all wear masks of a monstrous and grotesque nature. These masks, along with their costumes, which are of austere but dominating colors, give an almost mechanical quality to the human forms.At least so it is with the Oedipus of Douglas Campbell, the Creon of Robert Goodier, the Jocasta of Eleanor Stuart and the Priest of Eric House. Mr. Campbell in a mask of cold expression and an elaborate gold-colored costume appears an unearthly creature or an animated statue, at best. Likewise Miss Stuart, all in silver, and Mr. Goodier, in a martial sheath of bronze, appear as life-sized puppets or fearful figures in a dream.And blind Tiresias, the ancient prophet, whom Donald Davis performs, wears a mask and costume that lend the appearance of the skeletal remains of a giant bird.The consequence of this designing, which Tanya Moiseiwitsch has done, is to give to the entire performance the effect of a solemn ritual, rather than the illusion of a drama in which human beings and human emotions are involved. This was clearly Mr. Guthrie's purpose, for he has an actor, unmasked, preface the show with an explanation that the events you are about to witness \\"are not real, they are a re-enactment of a sacrifice.\\"Regarded so, as the performance of a sort of ritualistic dissertation on the inflexibility of fate, this rendering of the Sophoclean drama is a spectacular and awesome show. The studied groupings and movements of the colorful characters upon the stage, against a blue-gray cyclorama and a simple Grecian facade, have a mighty flow and rhythm that eerily attune to the power and cadence of the classical language that conveys the dramatic thought. The translation used in this performance is that of William Butler Yeats, the Irish poet, so that there is in the dialogue a trace of Hibernian imagery. And the actors all speak with clarity and grace.In a literal translation of the drama, such as this one is, a lot of action is missed that could be moving and illuminating on the screen. The whole story of Oedipus' childhood, his ambitious return to Thebes and his innocent marriage with his own mother could be made pictorial. Likewise, his horror at discovering the shameful truth and the punching out of his own eyes could be more forceful and terrible than they are in this masked charade.Indeed, there is little reason for the use of the cinematic device other than to make transportation of the Stratford stage show easier. What's the use of close-ups, for instance, when all we see are immobile masks? However, the Stratford stage show is done superlatively. For students and all with classical interests, this film is a jewel of great price.

They seek to demonstrate that their art involves more than the antics of gently comic and sweetly sad clowns in white-face makeup. These days, some mimes even talk. Despite their efforts, skeptics still charge that mime shows are too often nothing but collections of self-consciously clever wigglings and grimacings.    There were outbursts of French and English in \\"La Croisade\\" (\\"The Crusade\\"), the mime play created and performed by Steven Wasson and Corinne Soum that was presented Saturday night at Gould Hall by Le Theatre de l'Ange Fou, a Paris-based organization. Neither Miss Soum, a French mime, nor Mr. Wasson, an American, wore clown makeup. Nevertheless \\"La Croisade\\" was nothing but an hour of self-consciously clever wigglings and grimacings.    The work concerned a bumbling and timid angel's visit to an unhappy young woman. Miss Soum and Mr. Wasson tried to make its incidents varied, and they included everything from a comic drunk scene to a somber visit to a battlefield. Yet the piece soon grew intolerably coy because of the performers' habit of offering scores of gestures where only one or two well-chosen ones would have sufficed.      Miss Soum was dithery as the heroine. But all her flutters and fidgets did no more than make her look tiresomely fey. Mr. Wasson kept equally busy as the angel. His incessant gesticulations turned him into such a udget that his angel resembled the caricatures of department-store floorwalkers that used to turn up in old Hollywood movies. Neither character was consistently amusing or touching.    Doris Humphrey, one of the pioneers of modern dance, used to tell novice choreographers fond of compositional overelaboration, \\"Don't just do something","excerpt":"stand there!\\" Watching \\"La Croisade,\\" one knew what she meant.
