They are Terry Pendleton and Ted Higuera, and they were among 10 players who filed for free agency, raising the market's number to 31.   While those players prepare to pursue future riches, the Cincinnati Reds will soon be able to count what they earned by winning the World Series. The Reds, according to figures obtained from various major league sources, will receive $112,533 per man, falling less than $2,000 short of the record winner's share each Oakland player picked up a year ago.   Two members of the Reds' pitching rotation, Tom Browning and Danny Jackson, are expected to become free agents in the next few days. But Higuera, a Milwaukee Brewer left-hander, put his name on the list yesterday. So did Pendleton and John Tudor of St. Louis, Juan Samuel of Los Angeles, Tom Brunansky of Boston, Steve Farr of Kansas City, R. J. Reynolds of Pittsburgh, Jim Presley of Atlanta, Dan Petry of Detroit and John Moses of Pittsburgh.   Gene Michael, the Yankees' general manager, said the club's hierarchy would meet Friday to decide on plans, but, he added, \\"Two things we're going to look at are third base and pitching.\\" Cards Not Interested?     Pendleton has been considered one of the best defensive third basemen in the National League. The Cardinals haven't seemed interested in retaining him, benching him for most of the last month so they could try Todd Zeile, their catcher, at third.   Jim Bronner, Pendleton's agent, said he had not heard from the Cardinals about their interest in the 30-year-old switch-hitter, adding, \\"I don't imagine it's a high priority.\\"   Bronner said he was aware that Michael had spoken with people at the World Series about Pendleton. Bronner also represents Higuera, the 32-year-old Mexican who has a 12-3 career record against the Yankees.   \\"He's completely open,\\" Bronner said of Higuera's thoughts on his 1991 employment. Asked about the Yankees, the agent said, \\"The Yankees' record would be better if they didn't have to face him.\\"   Michael said the Yankees would like to acquire a starting pitcher, but their plans for their starting rotation also depend on whether or not they can re-sign Tim Leary, a free agent, and whether or not Mike Witt, whom they want to retain, is awarded a second chance at free agency as a result of the collusion cases.   To keep their bullpen intact, the Yankees have to re-sign Dave Righetti, a free agent. Jeff Robinson, another reliever, is also a free agent, but Michael said: \\"We probably won't go after him. We think he can be replaced by what we have.\\"   Higuera was a 20-game winner in 1986, then won a total of 34 games the next two seasons. But he had back surgery before the 1989 season and ankle surgery after. He had an 11-10 record this year with a 3.76 earned-run average. Bronner said the pitcher is healthy. Pendleton batted .230, a career low, and drove in 58 runs.   Two pitchers, Dave Smith of Houston and Jim Gott of Los Angeles, were offered salary arbitration. Their contracts have expired, but they cannot become free agents because they haven't completed the required five-year waiting period.   Players whose teams finished in the first three places in their divisions are awaiting their post-season checks from a pool of $11,438,462. That's about $700,000 under last year's record pool of $12.1 million.   Besides the Reds' World Series-winning share, the Oakland Athletics will have a $69,995 share, well under the $114,252 each player gained in a full share for winning last year.

Guitars were the main course of the evening. There are other elements to the band's rugged, blues-rock sound -- innocuous lyrics about girls and drinking, an extraordinarily tight rhythm section, pleasant rock melodies -- but they're carefully arranged so as not to get too much in the way. Throughout the show, the guitarists Charlie Sexton and Doyle Bramhall Jr. traded leads, overlapped leads, supported each other on rhythm and generally plugged in notes wherever they had a chance. It was a guitar fiesta.   Even Arc Angels' history is built around the guitar. Mr. Sexton began playing guitar for Joe Ely's band when he was 13. Mr. Bramhall was also sitting in on guitar as a teen-ager, with Stevie Ray Vaughan and the Fabulous Thunderbirds. The group's rhythm section, Tommy Shannon on bass and Chris Layton on drums, were members of the Vaughan backing band Double Trouble. Though Mr. Sexton and Mr. Bramhall are also Arc Angels' co-lead singers and co-songwriters, neither words nor vocals are meant to be selling points. On Arc Angels' eponymous debut album (DGC), the journeyman writing skills are evidenced by such efforts as \\"The Famous Jane,\\" based on rock songs featuring the name Jane in the title (Lou Reed's \\"Sweet Jane,\\" the Rolling Stones' \\"Lady Jane,\\" among others).
