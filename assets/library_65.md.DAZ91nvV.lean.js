Leopold Damrosch, who came to America from Germany in 1871, founded the New York Symphony, which was later merged into the New York Philharmonic, and the Oratorio Society of New York, which still sings. His son Walter was a conductor who persuaded Andrew Carnegie to build Carnegie Hall and who became a famous radio personality. Leopold's other son, Frank, founded what became the Juilliard School. His daughter, Clara, a pianist, married a violinist named David Mannes","excerpt":"together they founded what is now the Mannes College of Music. George Martin acknowledges that no member of the Damrosch-Mannes family was a great musician, but he presents them convincingly as a prodigious tribe of musical organizers, educators, taste-cultivators and institution-builders. ''The Damrosch Dynasty'' deals illuminatingly with the absorption of immigrants and their culture into American life, the relationship between high art and big money and, above all, the great change in values that has occurred over the last century. Meanwhile, family relationships are lovingly evoked. Impressionable children become powerful adults, then decline into old age, as in a good old- fashioned novel. As the years go by, the cast of characters gets larger and larger, but Mr. Martin carefully documents the story and keeps it remarkably clear.

She gives herself to the lute player in one of the most modest surrenders ever shown.And when he strangely disappears thereafter (it is said he has been fired from the combo in which he was a side-man because he failed to give his agent some of the money he got from the girl), she goes off into the Moroccan desert looking for the village in which the boy is supposed to live, until she runs out of energy, hope and money and has to allow herself to be taken as wife by a village man.Despite some rather nice pictorial values, which effectively convey the hot, dry beauty of Marrakesh and Morocco, where the entire film was made, and despite some other interesting details of native performance and musical score, this downbeat romance is dramatically disappointing and, as we say, quite incredible.Gavin Lambert, a British film critic, who is making his debut as a director with it, has tried to have the natural eloquence of image cover up the inadequacies of his script. But an English girl and a Moroccan boy exchanging glances or walking off beside a pool holding hands is not enough to explain the complex motives that cause her to abandon her way of life for him.Nor are the actors up to the challenge. Victoria Grayson is a sensitive-looking girl, but she is awkward and generally unexpressive in the more complicated passages of the film. A boy named Tayeb is handsome as the hero, but he is utterly bland and negative, and Catherine Lacey is downright amateurish as the English widow who employs the girl. A local Arab named Ahmed Ben Mahomed does the best job in the show as a tourist guide and personal mentor who abandons the girl when she runs out of cash.Weird and interesting native music is an essential part of the film, but we doubt that it will have anything like the effect on patrons that it has on the hapless heroine.

THE SECOND MARK: Courage, Corruption, and the Battle for Olympic Gold, by Joy Goodwin. (Simon & Schuster, $25.) Goodwin, a skating producer for ABC, uses her insider's access to excellent purpose; her account of the scandal-tarnished pairs final at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City is knowledgeable and empathetic, and does not substitute moral posturing for analysis.    THE CREATION OF THE MEDIA: Political Origins of Modern Communications, by Paul Starr. (Basic Books, $27.50.) A scholar's cautious, detailed, convincing account of the deliberate framing of information carriers, from cheap postage to privatized electronics (telegraph, telephone, radio) to saturation by movies, networks and magazines.    THE SARI SHOP, by Rupa Bajwa. (Norton, $23.95.) Bajwa's first novel is a comedy of manners, in which Ramchand, a young shop assistant, discovers the neighborhoods where the upper classes in Amritsar really live; a darker tone infiltrates when he turns to the poorest sectors, where violence and madness are never far removed.    THE HOLLYWOOD DODO, by Geoff Nicholson. (Simon & Schuster, $23.) The author's highly professional 14th novel concerns an aspiring director who wants to make a dodo movie; a 17th-century scientist who tried to save the bird back in the 1660's; and well-handled clichés of popular culture (success and failure in movies are equally corrupting).    BEASTS OF EDEN: Walking Whales, Dawn Horses, and Other Enigmas of Mammal Evolution, by David Rains Wallace. (University of California, $24.95.) A lively and deeply researched history of the ''bone hunters'' who have scoured the earth since the 18th century to elucidate mammal development in geological time and work out theories to account for it, from catastrophism through transmutation to Darwinian evolution.    WHY WE DO IT: Rethinking Sex and the Selfish Gene, by Niles Eldredge. (Norton, $24.95.) An eminent paleontologist takes on the adherents of sociobiology and evolutionary psychology; he pursues a quasi-teleological investigation of the main objective of sex, which in his view is species stability and extinction resistance, not just gene multiplication.    DYLAN'S VISIONs OF SIN, by Christopher Ricks. (Ecco, $26.95.) Ricks, the notable critic who has been elected the next professor of poetry at Oxford University, brings close, intense, learned scrutiny of the text -- the basic tool of the New Criticism -- to the songs of Bob Dylan, unveiling allusions, teasing out recalcitrant intentions and otherwise treating Dylan as he has treated Housman and Tennyson.

Opera    ''L' &#201","excerpt":"TOILE,'' Glimmerglass Opera. This delightful but rarely heard Chabrier operetta is presented in an imaginative staging by Mark Lamos, on sleek, clean-lined but quirkily amusing sets by Andrew Lieberman. The plot, naturally, is full of farcical twists involving King Ouf I, whose search for someone to execute (an annual tradition in his kingdom) is thwarted when the court astrologer discovers that the king is fated to die a day after the death of the intended victim, one Lazuli. Apart from the inevitable complication -- including Lazuli's having fallen in love with King Ouf's intended -- this offers a measure of protection for Lazuli and causes much anxiety when Lazuli is presumed dead. The cast includes Torrance Blaisdell as Ouf I, Christine Abraham as Lazuli, Troy Cook as H&#232;risson and Karina Gauvin as Laoula. Tomorrow night at 8.

Britten's gritty chamber opera ''The Rape of Lucretia'' has been staged grippingly by Christopher Alden.

As they tell the tale of envy, lust and rape in pagan Rome, they interact with the characters with whom they eerily identify. Michelle DeYoung as Lucretia and Nathan Gunn as the menacing Etruscan prince Tarquinius give powerful performances. Handel's ''Agrippina,'' a satirical telling of the story of the Emperor Claudius's wife, who tries to get him to name Nero, her son from a previous marriage, as heir, gets a suitably witty, imaginative and compelling staging here. The cast members look and act better than they sing. But the opera is a masterpiece, and the show is enjoyable. The strongest members of the cast of Mozart's ''Nozze di Figaro'' are Joyce Guyer, as the forlorn, fragile and dignified Countess, and Christopher Schaldenbrand, as the preening, sexually voracious and dangerously handsome Count.

The Mets' prospects were playing the Detroit Tigers' prospects. One of the Mets' most promising young players on the island, a 17-year-old shortstop named Samuel Jiuz, was making his first start. As he took infield and batting practice, it was easy to see why the Mets are so high on Jiuz. He possesses what scouts call ''plus tools'' -- a strong arm, soft hands, speed and power -- as well as a ''good body.'' Lean and muscular, he appears in no danger of growing fat. Right now, he's listed at 6-foot-3 and 176 pounds, but with better nutrition and weight training, the Mets' senior scout for the Dominican Republic, Eddy Toledo, expects him to put on 25 pounds of muscle over the next few years. Scouts like to match a prospect with the major leaguer whom he most closely resembles","excerpt":"Toledo compares Jiuz to the former All-Star shortstop Tony Fernandez.    Both of Jiuz's parents died years ago -- his mother in a motor-scooter accident, his father of a lung ailment -- and he was raised by an uncle in San Pedro de Macorís, the Dominican Republic's most fertile source of major leaguers. Jiuz started playing baseball at age 9 with a makeshift glove, fashioned from a milk carton, and a homemade ball, essentially a small rock wrapped in twine and then dropped in a sock.

He was lucky, Mr. Conti, 54, admits. His father owned a beauty parlor, and the business did well. \\"There was money, and there was comfort,\\" he said. \\"My father was a kind of middle-class Italian Scot. Mine was a silver-spoon immigrant life.\\"         So Mr. Conti rather hopes that it was not his Italian surname that won him a  lead role in \\"Someone Else's America,\\" Goran Paskaljevic's film about foreigners struggling to make it in Brooklyn. The film, which opens in New York on Friday,  won a prize at last year's Cannes film festival.

But while it keeps trying for laughs continuously, it connects with only a few before going down swinging.Frank Tashlin, the writer, and Lloyd Bacon, the director, seemed to have depended largely on corn and speed in fashioning this antic. Their hero, Bill Johnson, is a likable but undependable St. Petersburg, Fla., fan, who invariably loses his job once the spring training season gets under way.Then, his father-in-law, who happens to be a retired umpire, saves a threatened family crisis by enrolling his hapless relation in an umpire's school from which he is graduated to the Texas Interstate League. It is there that he is offered a bribe by local gamblers complete with drawls and dollars, and it is there, also, that he calls a close play which results in a rhubarb to end all rhubarbs. Needless to say our battered but undaunted umpire is vindicated, but not before a lot of film footage inspired by the Keystone Kops school of comedy is unreeled.As the much-maligned man-behind-the-iron-mask, William Bendix does well by a role which calls for him to contribute a record number of grimaces and double-takes. If he seems somewhat silly as a student at the school, where the curricula seems to consist of learning how to call \\"strike\\" and \\"yer out\\" with gestures, he must be credited with approaching the whole business good-naturedly and professionally.Abetting him in supporting roles, which are not especially inspired, are Ray Collins, as his father-in-law","excerpt":"Tom D'Andrea, as a fellow umpire who is addicted to pills and afflicted with a twitching eye; Una Merkel, as his wife; Gloria Henry and Connie Marshall, as his daughters, and William Frawley, as the umpire school's prexy.

The Yankees rely on their starters to get into the seventh inning","excerpt":"Tom Gordon and Mariano Rivera take it from there. That formula will be risky in this series, but the Yankees will try to avoid the Angels' strategy of fouling balls off at will. Several Yankees pitchers are not afraid to let hitters make contact.    ANGELS  No staff in the American League racked up as many strikeouts as the Angels. The Game 1 starter Bartolo Colón won 21 games, and John Lackey, who beat the Yankees twice this season, was 8-1 with a 2.57 earned run average in the second half. The bullpen is deeper than the Yankees' and just as dangerous, with the righthanders Brendan Donnelly and Scot Shields setting up the closer Francisco Rodriguez. With those arms, the lack of a bullpen lefty is negligible.    HITTING    YANKEES  The Yankees scored 125 more runs than the Angels this season, with a devastating top of the order. Lower down, catcher Jorge Posada and second baseman Robinson Cano finished strong at the plate. Gary Sheffield is deadly with runners in scoring position (.364), and Hideki Matsui has a .339 career average in the postseason.    ANGELS  Some of the names are different from the 2002 champions, but the approach is the same. The Angels are still pests to pitchers. Only Oakland struck out fewer times than the Angels, who wear down pitchers with long at-bats, then get on base and run wild. The Angels led the majors in stolen bases, and Chone Figgins had a major league-best 62. Vladimir Guerrero can hit virtually any pitch in any location, but he has a combined .177 career average against Randy Johnson, Mike Mussina and Shawn Chacon.    FIELDING    YANKEES  Joe Torre would prefer to use Tino Martinez over Jason Giambi at first base, but Martinez is 0 for 15 against the Game 1 starter Bartolo Colón and will open the series on the bench. Bubba Crosby is Torre's best defensive center fielder, and he will start there in the opener, with Bernie Williams at designated hitter. The pitching staff and the catchers must contain the Angels' running game after allowing 21 steals in 27 attempts against the Angels this season. Alex Rodriguez keeps improving at third, with perhaps the best infield arm in the majors.    ANGELS  The Angels made only 87 errors, one shy of the lowest total in the league. Right fielder Vladimir Guerrero keeps runners honest, and shortstop Orlando Cabrera, first baseman Darin Erstad, center fielder Steve Finley and catcher Bengie Molina have all won Gold Gloves in the last five years. Chone Figgins started at six positions (not catcher or first base) and excelled everywhere.    X-FACTOR    YANKEES  Fans will not want to miss the matchup of Alex Rodriguez and Bartolo Colón. Rodriguez, the Yankees' best hitter, owns Colon, the Angels' ace. Rodriguez slammed three homers in three at-bats off Colon on April 26, and then homered in his next at-bat off him, on July 21. In his career, Rodriguez is 19 for 43 (.442) with 7 homers off Colon.    ANGELS  At 52-49, including the postseason, the Angels are the only team with a winning record against the Yankees in Joe Torre's 10 years as manager. The only way to beat them, Torre has said many times, is with attention to detail. But the Yankees will not have a mental edge. From their fiery leader, Darin Erstad, to the graceful and underrated Garret Anderson, the Angels have never been awed by the Yankees.

He believes he can become re-engaged only by committing a completely irrational act: He plans to kill the President of the United States.The picture, written and directed by the 27-year-old Mr. Kramer, opened here yesterday at the New Cinema Playhouse, the underground cinema's first-run Manhattan showcase.The theme of the film is stated by the one character in the movie who has not yet been totally neutralized by his frustrations.This young man, a former civil rights worker who is rather half-heartedly planning to organize a campus draft resistance movement, says at one point:\\"I know there's a war going on and I know it's bad, but I don't know how to take what I believe and make something happen.\\"That's also the cry of America's would-be-committed middle class, which, intentionally or not, is the group Mr. Kramer is making his film about.His characters—Village intellectuals, artists, sometimes activists and their wives and mistresses—are all comparatively fat cats. Their pads, for the most part, are sleazily typical—sling chairs, lumpy looking beds and cardboard coffee containers for ash trays—but nobody is activated by a need as basic as hunger. Rather, they seem to be anesthetized as much by boredom and their own basic affluence as by the paradoxes of the contemporary war-peace society.This, it seems to me, is the only way to explain the utter lethargy that greets the announcement of one of their friends that he plans to kill the President to atone for the killing in Vietnam. Some attempts are made to talk the assassin out of his plan, and even he agrees that it is senseless. But his friends do nothing to prevent the act, either to save their friend—who seems to have flipped over the edge of sanity—or their own causes, to say nothing of preventing a rather superfluous murder in Washington.Although Mr. Kramer's intellectual approach is oblique, his film style is nothing if not frontal. He snoots in an economical, cinema vérité manner, in the apartments, on the streets, on the highways, on the beaches and in the countryside. His characters talk almost constantly, sometimes on camera, sometimes only on the soundtrack. Unfortunately, the latter is often fuzzy, but this has its own authenticity. So does much of the dialogue, even at its most puerile, and the grainy black-and-white photography.The actors, none of whom are well known, do not so much act as appear as the embodiments of various attitudes and positions. Most prominent are Jack Rader, as the ill-fated assassin, destined, of course, to fail","excerpt":"Tom Griffin, as the young man who continues, doggedly, to work as an organizer, and Paul Hultberg, as the comparatively settled—he has wife and child—guru of this cell of lost revolutionists.\\"The Edge\\" is not poetic. Rather it is noteworthy as one of the few examples of underground cinema totally committed to the social-political scene. The Edge' Begins Run"},{"year":"1974","title":"HANOVER, N.

When APAH was well established, he turned his time and attention to the Arlington Street People's Assistance Network (ASPAN) where he served as treasurer until 2001. Tom's home and family were cherished by him, and he worked diligently to help others know that kind of comfort. In 1997, Arlington County recognized him as the first community hero, for his work on behalf of the vulnerable members of society. He leaves behind his beloved wife of 46 years, Dolores (Conklin) and his dear children Mary Kate Marcellus, her husband Ronald and their sons Cameron and Conor; Dr. Celia Leckey and her son Samuel X. Brase; Thomas J. Leckey and his wife Dr. Margaret Kabalin Leckey and their daughters Monica and Grace, Dr. Colum Leckey, his wife Donna Bible and their children Roman and Maria. Tom also leaves behind his brother John J. Leckey and his wife Myra and their children Shannon, Courtney and Sean; and his sister Mary Jane Cannon and her sons Donald, Terry and Alex. Countless friends, colleagues and Arlington citizens also mourn his passing. The wake will be held at Our Lady Queen of Peace Catholic Church in Arlington on Thursday, June 26, from 7-9PM. The Mass of the Resurrection will be celebrated there at 11AM on Friday, June 27. Donations in his memory may be made to APAH or ASPAN, both located in Arlington, VA, or to the scholarship fund at Fordham Prep. Tom's infectious laugh, keen intellect, generous heart and Irish singing will be greatly missed.

The film arrived at the Carnegie Hall Cinema yesterday. The producers' fantasy may be a mite too coy and sugary for sophisticated youngsters and a trifle too fantastic for practical parents, but this combination of flaws, fancies and satire makes for a decidely special, but refreshing, mélange of make-believe.A cartoon specialist who made his feature film debut in 1966 with this work, Dusan Vukotic, the director-co-writer, uses an animated approach to his subject by concentrating on childlike imagination rather than full explanations.His truly charming moppet principals, the Yellow Girl and the White Boy, blithely leave a ferry to sail off in an inflated raft in seach of the little girl's basket. Before you can say Alice in Wonderland, they're on an uninhabited island, they \\"grow\\" a forest of trees from pictures on a map and they've attracted children from all over the world to their Paradise, where conch shells emit wonderful music and indifferent grown-ups are conspicuous by their absence.As an adult, however, Mr. Vukotic insists on some elaboration in the form of action demanded by the confused, frightened and grieving grown-ups. As a product of Iron Curtain countries, the resulting hue and cry and investigations are a surprising ribbing of the military, the police, radio commercials and even United Nations-like emergency conference whose pompous semantics seem closer to truth than to caricature.Although the adult actors are Yugoslav and Czechoslovak professionals, whose contributions are sincere but fragmentary, the large contingent of youngsters, amateurs reportedly enlisted from European embassies and other sources, has little dialogue, but behaves like uninhibited, normal children. Special commendation is due to the fine colors in which their fable was filmed and to Iris Vrus, the brunette Yellow Girl","excerpt":"Tomislav Pasaric, the blond White Boy, and Abdulaie Seck, their Negro companion, who handle the leading roles with endearing ease and naïveté.English subtitles elucidate the Serbo-Croatian lines, which may not be sufficient to satisfy viewers apathetic to allegory.

Broadway    * ''BARBARA COOK'S BROADWAY.'' There may be no more compelling exemplar of artful vocal simplicity than this lyric soprano, who at 77 has the sunny lyric soprano of a woman less than half her age. Her show, ending a limited engagement (it is bound to have other lives), is an intimate musical autobiography whose songs, sandwiched between anecdotes, reprise and parallel her career during the so-called golden age of the Broadway musical. In her later years Ms. Cook, the onetime ingénue who made her debut in ''Flahooley'' and starred in ''The Music Man,'' ''Candide'' and ''She Loves Me,'' has ripened into the Broadway equivalent of the cabaret legend Mabel Mercer in her ability to convey wisdom and compassion through singing. The most memorable numbers, performed with Wally Harper on piano and Richard Sarpola on bass, include definitive interpretations of ''This Nearly Was Mine,'' ''Time Heals Everything'' and ''The Party's Over'' (1:30).

''Central Park,'' to be seen on Sunday, is a trilogy of concise, powerful new operas by three accomplished young composers and three prominent playwrights, all set in different parts of Central Park: In ''The Festival of Sorrows,'' by Deborah Drattell and Wendy Wasserstein, an afternoon of introspection at a Jewish New Year's ritual at the Bethesda Fountain draws a divorced couple back together. In ''Strawberry Fields,'' by Michael Torke and A. J. Gurney, a compassionate student befriends a senile woman whose children are trying to institutionalize her. And in ''The Food of Love,'' by Robert Beaser and Terrance McNally, a homeless woman tries to give her newborn son to someone who will give him a good future.

This musical adaptation of Aristophanes' 2,400-year-old comedy of gods and playwrights has the highest concentration of blue-ribbon talent of any show now on Broadway. It stars Nathan Lane, the only actor who qualifies as serious royalty in the thinning world of musical comedy, and Roger Bart, whose very smile has been known to stop a show. The director and choreographer is Susan Stroman (''The Producers,'' ''Contact''). And the composer is -- reverent pause, please -- Stephen Sondheim. Yet despite these fine ingredients, what should have been a zesty, airy soufflé is a soggy, lumpy batter that never shows the slightest signs of rising. Staged in 1974 as a publicity-garnering, hourlong novelty by the Yale School of Drama -- around and in the university gymnasium swimming pool, if you please -- this bauble of a show has been reshaped to fill two and a half hours. The results suggest that to stretch something this slight is to shatter it (2:30). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200.

As she demonstrated in her Pulitzer Prize-winning account of a pedophile and his prey, ''How I Learned to Drive,'' this venturesome dramatist can seduce even queasy theatergoers with her transforming theatrical wit and compassion. With its mix of social instruction and stylized musical interludes, ''The Oldest Profession,'' lumberingly directed by David Esbjornson, is Ms. Vogel's most Brechtian play, a lesson not in sex education but the down side of supply-side economics. But the show's cool analytical shell can't really accommodate the fuzzy sentimentality within. Form is uneasily dictating content here.

As part of his Perspectives series at Carnegie Hall, he returns with the orchestra for two programs this weekend, including tonight's performance of ''Cassandre'' by the noted Swiss composer Michael Jarrell, based on a contemporary reimagining of the ancient myth. (The actress Barbara Sukowa -- of early Fassbinder fame -- declaims the text over a chamber orchestra studded with synthesizers.) Tomorrow, Mr. Robertson, recently decorated for his commitment to American music, will lead John Adams's moving 9/11 memorial piece, ''On the Transmigration of Souls.'' The work was written less than a year after the attack and conceived as a ''memory space'' that includes lists of victims' names, samples of urban noise and a children's choir. It should be fascinating to see how the piece ages as the national memory of the tragedy itself continues to shift. (At least Mr. Adams's memorial has been realized, unlike most other projects connected to ground zero.) Brahms's ''German Requiem'' fills out the program on a somber note.
