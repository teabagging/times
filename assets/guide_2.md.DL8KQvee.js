Actually, Playwrights Horizons is financially stable for the first time in a while, according to its director, Andre Bishop.

Most domestic culinary programs serve as retreats for gourmands, who largely prefer to keep their enjoyment of food and wine separate from entertaining children. You generally have to go abroad to find places where children are welcome in the kitchen. Here are some options, including one in New England.    WHERE -- Etla Valley, Mexico    WHY -- In a daylong class, participants shop in the local markets of Oaxaca, have a light brunch, and then travel to Rancho Aurora, Susana Trilling's home and cooking school. They spend the rest of the day reviewing ingredients and preparing a five-course meal. Students return to Oaxaca at 6 p.m. Seasons of My Heart, (52-951) 508-0044, www.seasonsofmyheart.com, also offers longer courses and culinary tours.    WHEN -- Wednesdays, based on availability (six-person minimum).    HOW LONG -- One day.    HOW MUCH -- $75 a person.    AGE MINIMUM -- The suggested age is 10 and over, but younger children interested in cooking are welcome, as long as they are with their parents.    WHERE -- Essex, Vt.    WHY -- The Inn at Essex, (800) 727-4295, www.innatessex.com, an AAA four-diamond luxury resort, is also the home of the New England Culinary Institute. The Chef ''Inn'' Training package includes a tour of the school and a course in its culinary ''theater,'' during which students prepare -- and then eat -- a three-course meal. A night's stay at the inn and breakfast the next day are also included.      After leaving the inn, families can head down Interstate 89 to Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream Factory in Waterbury, (802) 882-1240, www.benjerry.com (about 30 miles from Essex), for a tour and tasting ($3","excerpt":"12 and under free), and then to the Baking Education Center in Norwich, (800) 652-3334, online at www.kingarthurflour.com/ baking/norwich.php (another 60 miles on I-89 from Waterbury), where winter workshops (left) include gingerbread and cinnamon roll making ($40 to $75 for a day's class, depending on the class).    WHEN -- Wednesdays through Saturdays.    HOW MUCH -- $319 to $399 for two participants, depending on time of year. For each additional participant, the cost is $60 plus tax.    HOW LONG -- One day and one night.    AGE MINIMUM -- Children of all ages are welcome, as long as they're interested in cooking.    WHERE -- Amalfi Coast, Italy    WHY -- The cooking classes at Villa Azzura, in the cliffside village of Positano, facing the Tyrrhenian Sea, emphasize the importance of the Amalfi lemon, in local drinks like limoncello, and other seasonal products. Other options include a Neapolitan pizza party; pasta, fish and chocolate workshops; and a trip to an olive-pressing site. Day trips include Capri, Ravello and Sorrento. Sponsored by the Boston-based company Cooking Vacations, (800) 916-1152, www.cooking-vacations.com.    WHEN -- All year, except the last 10 days of January.    HOW LONG -- One week.    HOW MUCH -- $2,900 a person (based on double occupancy; does not include air fare); free for children 12 and under.    AGE MINIMUM -- Children as young as 3 are welcome in the kitchen. Babysitting is available at an extra charge.    WHERE -- Paris    WHY -- For this crash course in French cuisine, students learn how to select onions, shallots, herbs and other fresh ingredients in the morning at a Paris market. Next, they prepare a multicourse lunch in an apartment, near the Champs-Élysées. Although the menu depends on what the group decides on -- and on what is fresh that day -- the basics, like butter clarification and working with herbs -- are always emphasized. The International Kitchen, (800) 945-8606, www.theinternationalkitchen.com, based in Chicago, sponsors the course.    WHEN -- Tuesdays through Fridays for a minimum of two people, based on availability.    HOW LONG -- One day.    HOW MUCH -- $250 a person for two participants or more; $230 for three or more.    AGE MINIMUM -- 10 and over.

The reward for these good deeds? Each shift -- with a minimum commitment of three -- gets you a voucher to see the films yourself. And last year, six surprise screenings took place for volunteers only.    Volunteer hotline: (212)941-2404 or www.tribecafilmfestival.org.    ART FOR SALE  The Art Dealers Association of America's annual art fair ends on Monday, so today's the day to come by and see what's been sold and what's headed for the discount bin. Robert Miller Gallery has a really big Lee Krasner painting from 1962, called ''Cosmic Fragments,'' that draws its colors from the poodle that the artist shared with Jackson Pollock. For an accounting of relationships gone bad, there's Andy Warhol's ''Men in Her Life,'' a 1962 silkscreen of Elizabeth Taylor and her husband, Mike Todd, with Eddie Fisher, Debbie Reynolds and their infant child at the booth of the Los Angeles-based Margo Leavin Gallery.    Seventh Regiment Armory, Park Avenue at 67th Street","excerpt":"12 to 6 p.m.; $15. (Also on Monday.)    TRAPPIST DREAMS  In ''Trinity of Two,'' a trippy new play by Kimberly Megna, two childhood friends are reunited by a mutual nightmare; the two women join forces in the catacombs beneath Vatican City, where they find their dreams mimic the journals of Thomas Merton, the (real life) Trappist monk who died by accidental electrocution in Bangkok in 1968.    Center Stage, 48 West 21st Street, Man-hattan; 5 p.m.;$15. (Through March 13.)    MONDAY 2/28    TIMES SQUARE, THEN  Today the Times Square Centennial Film Festival -- which was produced by the Times Square Alliance and organized by the Museum of the Moving Image to promote the now tourist-friendly neighborhood -- takes a look back at the grimy old days. ''Taxi Driver'' (1976) plays at 1:30 and 7 p.m. And you don't want to miss ''Shaft'' (1971), starring Richard Roundtree as the sex-machine/detective John Shaft, at 4:10 and 9:45 p.m. Next week brings ''Midnight Cowboy'' (1969) and ''Fame'' (1980).    Loews State Theater, 1540 Broadway, between 45th and 46th Streets; $9. For the complete schedule: www.timessquarenyc.org.    AN ORANGE CRUSH  The Irkutsk-born photographer Alexander Khantaev has returned from Ukraine with photographs of the waves of street demonstrations that led to the election of Viktor A. Yushchenko as president in December. One color predominates; for months the crowds wore orange, the color for which their revolution is named.    The Cooper Union, Humanities Gallery, 51 Astor Place, 11 a.m. to 7 p.m.; free. (Through March 10.)    NEW ON DVD: TRILOGIES  ''Piccadilly'' (Milestone, $29.95), a 1929 film starring Anna May Wong, has been remastered and rescored; along with ''Variété'' (1925) and ''Moulin Rouge'' (1928) , the film is part of E.A. Dupont's trilogy about life backstage. The Christopher Guest three-pack bundles ''A Mighty Wind,'' ''Best in Show'' and ''Waiting for Guffman'' (Warner Home Video, $32.95).    TUESDAY 3/1    A PANEL OF ANDY  Kenneth Goldsmith is the editor of ''I'll Be Your Mirror: The Selected Andy Warhol Interviews.'' Tonight he serves as the moderator of a panel of friends and scholars, including Billy Name, who, despite all his accomplishments as a photographer, is perhaps still most famous for silvering Warhol's Factory.    The Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea; 7 p.m.; $8.    COUNTRY REALITY  The third season of ''Nashville Star,'' an ''American Idol'' knockoff, begins tonight; instead of Ryan Seacrest, this show brings out the country singer LeAnn Rimes as host. (She's lucky enough to get a sidekick named Cledus T. Judd.) Unlike much other reality fare, the show has no age cap for contestants; it's a respite from TV's youth obsession. Nine weeks from now, one of the 10 finalists will win a recording contract with Universal South Records.    USA Network, 10 p.m., Eastern and Pacific times; 9 Central.    HORSES ON HOLD  Where has Betty Buckley, Broadway star and former Grizabella of ''Cats,'' been? Out riding horses on her Texas ranch for the last few years, Ms. Buckley returns for five weeks of vocal fireworks at the Cafe Carlyle; her revue of love songs runs the gamut from Henry Mancini to Tom Waits.    Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street; 8:45 p.m.; $60-$70; there is no minimum. (Through April 9.)    WEDNESDAY 3/2    PRAYING IN MANHATTAN  Jaime Permuth, a Guatemalan photographer who lives in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, followed Manhattan's ''Mincha'' map, an eight-page guide to Jewish afternoon prayer locations that he saw in the The Torah Times.His photographs record groups of friends and strangers gathering in the early afternoons in jewelry stores and pizzerias and electronics shops all over town. A related exhibition by Moico Yaker, on view through May 1, features paintings and drawings that capture the artist's fantasies when he has his own difficulties praying.    Yeshiva University Museum, 15 West 16th Street, Flatiron District; 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.; $6. (Through June 19.)    SINGAPORE'S TARDY DEBUT  In all its 25 years, the Singapore Orchestra has never made it to New York, but they rectify that tonight. Yo-Yo Ma joins the orchestra for ''Ballad, Dance and Fantasy,'' the first of the evening's two works by the Chinese-born American composer Chen Yi; the violinist Gil Shaham shows up for support in ''The Butterfly Lovers.''    Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center; 8 p.m.; $35 to $68.    BEDROOM GAMES  ''I Found Her Tied to My Bed,'' a dark comedy by the playright Jeff Tabnick that ran briefly in Manhattan in 2003, begins inside the cramped apartment of a woman named Beth; Jan, her new co-worker at the Evergreen Manor Nursing Home, finds herself in the iffy situation referred to in the title.    Under St. Mark's, 94 Saint Mark's Place, East Village: 8 p.m., $5. (Through March 23.)    THURSDAY 3/3    POETRY EXTRAVAGANZA  For the Festival of New American Poets, a two-night hoedown of readings, the Poetry Society of America chose 16 poets who published exciting debut collections last year. They'll be joined by the society's four Chapbook Fellows, selected by established poets including Robert Creeley.    Tishman Auditorium, New School University, 66 West 12th Street, Greenwich Village; 7:30 p.m.; $10 for both nights, $7 for one. (Also on March 2.)    NATIONAL DANCE  Programming this week at Dance Theater Workshop asks questions about the influence of national identity on the movement arts. Short Mean Lady, the Crete-born Amanda Loulaki's four-member company, will present new works, including ''La la la la, Resistance (the Island of Breezes),'' which finds the choreographer the object of her dance-partner's frustrations.    219 West 19th Street, Chelsea; 7:30 p.m.; $20. (Through March 5.)    THE LITTLE PASSION  Bach's ''St. Matthew Passion,'' usually performed by a huge chorus with double orchestra, gets pared down by the New York Collegium; it uses only eight singers (as was popular in Bach's time), who perform as both soloists and chorus. At 7 p.m., a preconcert discussion will be led by Daniel Melamed, a musicologist at the Indiana University School of Music.    Church of St. Ignatius Loyola, 980 Park Avenue, at 83rd Street; 8 p.m.; $30 to $50, $20 students. (Also on March 4,)    FRIDAY 3/4    FILM IN HARLEM  The Harlem Film Festival, which features a slender, carefully selected helping of films almost entirely by women of color, begins tonight. ''The Healing Passage,'' a film by S. Pearl Sharp that looks at healing the lingering effects of slavery in America, shows tonight at 7:30. The festival ends on March 6 with the remastered release of the 1964 film ''Nothing but a Man,'' a little-shown story of black life in the South; it co-stars the jazz queen Abbey Lincoln and screens at 5 p.m.    Aaron Davis Hall, City College of New York, 138 Convent Avenue, between West 133rd and 135th Streets, Hamilton Heights; $10 or weekend pass, $42. See www.aarondavishall.org for a festival schedule.    TAPPERS  The Joel Forrester Quartet, of bass and drum, piano and sax, accompanies the seven hoofers of the Peggy Spina Tap Company in Ms. Spina's spacious home -- it seats about 80. Tonight they click and clack their way through two premieres and a few classics, including the tap legend Buster Brown's ''Laura.''    Spina Loft, 115 Prince Street, SoHo; 8 p.m.; $20. (Also on March 5.)    ROAD ROCK  The Portland, Ore., band System and Station hits New York to play its messy rock. With a bit of the sonic guitar sprawl popular in the early 90's and a pinch of classic rock's non-song song structure (think Zeppelin), the band makes intricate, dusty road rock. (The night of rock continues with five bands playing until the wee hours.)    Delancey Lounge, 168 Delancey Street, Lower East Side; 8 p.m.; $7.    THEATERS OF WAR  The photographs of the Belgian-born Bart Michiels appear to be plain if very beautiful landscapes: verdant fields, smoky mountains. But each is a portrait of a battlefield, its scars long healed. ''Anzio, 1944, Yellow Beach'' is a portrait of a lovely still breakwater where in 1944 British and American troops took the Italian beach. ''Verdun, 1916, Le Mort-Homme'' is misty and green, showing only the tracks of what might be tractors, not the estimated 700,000 French and German casualties.    Foley Gallery, 547 West 27th Street, Chelsea; 11 a.m to 6 p.m.; free. (Through April 2.)    SATURDAY 3/5    MORE TRAVOLTA  F. Gary Gray, the director of ''The Italian Job,'' tries his hand with a gritty Elmore Leonard adaptation in ''Be Cool,'' with John Travolta as a jaded Hollywood exec. (MGM, national release.) In ''Dear Frankie,'' a feel-good movie about poor but noble Scots, a mother forges fantastic letters by her young son's father from his trip around the world; fortunately, she gets the astoundingly good-looking Gerard Butler to pose as the deadbeat dad when her yarns meet reality. (Miramax, New York and Los Angeles only.) Adrien Brody plays a crazy time-traveler in the psych-thriller ''The Jacket.'' (Warner Brothers, national release.)    ONWARD CHRISTIAN CHOIRS  A great excuse to get inside the Salvation Army's mammoth building on West 14th Street: ''On We March'' celebrates the 125th anniversary of the founding of the New York Temple Corps with an evening of choral music. (The event commemorates the arrival from England of the crusader George Scott Railton and seven evangelical women called the Hallelujah Lassies.) The Brooklyn Tabernacle Singers will also join in.    The Salvation Army's Centennial Memorial Temple, 120 West 14th Street, Greenwich Village; 7 p.m.; $10.    MATT AND THE PRINCE  Bonnie (Prince) Billy -- the musical alter ego of Will Oldham -- and Matt Sweeney bring out their guitars for a whirlwind tour of New York's alternative record stores today. Their new collaboration, ''Superwolf'' (Drag City), is a spare affair of wordplay, nicely suited for intimate storefront performance.    Sound Fix, 110 Bedford Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, 1 p.m.; Kim's Mediapolis, 2906 Broadway, at 113th Street, 3 p.m.; Built by Wendy, 7 Centre Market Place, at Broome Street, Little Italy, 5 p.m.; Mondo Kim's, 6 St. Marks Place, East Village, 7 p.m.; Other Music, 15 East Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, 9 p.m.; free.

He joined the firm in 1939","excerpt":"12 years after it was founded by Rear Admiral Frederic R. Harris, retired Chief of the U.S. Navy's Bureau of Yards and Docks. He rose to lead the firm shortly after the Admiral's death in 1949 and oversaw a period of unprecedented growth and diversification. Originally focused predominantly on ports and marine work, he quickly steered the company into other sectors such as highways, mass transit and oil industry related facilities. Harris became global in its business operations, securing assignments in Europe, Latin America, Africa, Australia and Southeast Asia. Harris became one of the first true multinational corporations, creating joint companies in many countries including Turkey, Iran, Spain, Italy and Venezuela. Under Mr. Quirin's leadership, the firm secured and performed some of the world's largest projects of the late 1950's and early 1960's including the design and construction management of a program to build U.S. military bases in Spain; the Kharg Island Oil Terminal in Iran and the Inner Ring Road project in Antwerp, Belgium, for which he received an award from the Belgian Government. Mr. Quirin, who retired from the firm in 1972, held a Bachelor of Science Degree in Civil Engineering from Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute. After retirement, he served for two years as president of his alma mater and was also president of the Board of Directors of the Knickerbocker Hospital in New York City. He was a licensed Professional Engineer in several states as well as an accomplished writer, having authored several articles on dry docks for the Encyclopedia Americana. He was a member of Christ the King Church in Old Lyme, a past president and life trustee of the Connecticut River Museum in Essex and was a partner in the engineering consulting firm of Besier, Gibble and Quirin in Old Saybrook, CT.

In addition to his wife he is survived by two daughters: Barbara Ann Badran of Cambridge, Maryland and Eleanor Catherine Loss of Los Angeles, California, a sister Louise Spahn of Oneonta, New York, four grandchildren and one greatgrandson.

Historical Moldavia, of which present-day Moldova is only a small portion, encompassed territories that are now in Romania and Ukraine (including southern Bessarabia and northern Bukovina). Moldova is a hilly, fertile land, bounded by two great rivers, the Dniester and the Prut, that flow into the Black Sea. Its climate is very favorable to agriculture. Moldavia was part of Scythia in the first millennium B.C. and later came under the Roman Empire. Lying on the gateway to Europe, it was invaded successively, but came under the control of Kievan Rus between the 10th and 12th centuries A.D., and in the 13th century it was invaded by the Mongolian empire. In the 16th century, eastern Moldavia, or Bessarabia, came under Turkish control but in 1812 was ceded to the Russian empire. Southern Bessarabia (now in Ukraine) was controlled variously by the Russian empire and by Romania, and in 1878 it again became part of Russia. After the Bolsheviks came to power in 1917 and created the U.S.S.R., a Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (ASSR) was formed on the eastern side of the Dniester River, a territory claimed by Romania but populated by Ukrainians. In June 1940, as a result of the Nazi-Soviet Pact of 1939, Romania was forced to cede Bessarabia and northern Bukovina to the Soviet Union. These lands were made part of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic (SSR), and the remaining Bessarabian sections were merged with the old Moldavian ASSR to create on Aug. 2, 1940, the Moldavian SSR. Between 1941 and 1944, while Romania and the U.S.S.R. were at war, Bessarabia again became part of Romania, but in 1944 the Soviets retook the territory and reestablished it as a union republic. While under Soviet control, Moldavians in the new republic were officially differentiated from their counterparts across the border in Romania. In 1940, the Cyrillic alphabet was imposed on the Romanian language; this official language was called “Moldavian.” Contacts between the two countries were discouraged, and the U.S.S.R. encouraged Russian and Ukrainian immigration to the Moldavian SSR. While a part of the U.S.S.R., Moldavia created a diversified economy, which is based on agriculture and food processing, with a small industrial base. Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, or openness, in the late 1980's gave vent to Moldavian complaints about “Russification” and immigration of non-Moldavians. In Sept. 1989, Romanian, now in a Latin script, was restored as the official language. Glasnost also gave birth to new political parties, the largest of which was the Popular Front of Moldavia, which organized protest demonstrations against Soviet power. Disturbances during the 1989 celebration of Soviet Revolution Day in the capital city of Kishinev led to the dismissal of the Slavic Communist party First Secretary, and his replacement by an ethnic Romanian. The Communist party was banned in Moldova in 1990, and laws to develop the basics of a multiparty system were adopted in September 1991. Moldova officially declared its independence from the U.S.S.R. on Aug. 27, 1991, and in December, United Front-supported Mircea Snegur was elected president with 98.2% of the votes cast. At the time Moldova declared its independence, sentiment was strong for reunification with Romania. So strong, in fact, that ethnic Russians and Ukrainians living in the Trans-Dniester region in eastern Moldova, fearing reunification with Romania, declared an independent Trans-Dniester republic, sparking ethnic violence there. But since then, most activity has focused on reestablishing ties with countries from the former U.S.S.R. In 1991, Moldova singed the Alma-Ata Declaration, joining the other former Soviet republics in the Commonwealth of Independent States. And in the country's first parlimantary elections, held in Feb. of 1994, two nationalist parties captured a combined 15 percent of the vote, while the pro-Russian Socialist party won 25 percent, and the Agrarian Democratic Party, led by former Communists, took 45 percent. Then, in a plebiscite held Mar. 6, 1994, an overwhelming majority (90 percent) of voters rejected reunification with Romania in favor of an independent Moldova. Two-thirds of Moldova's 2.3 million eligible voters cast ballots on the plebiscite. Snegur intended to use the referendum result to entice Trans-Dniester to rejoin Moldova. In late 1996 Snegur lost the presidency to Petro Lucinschi who quickly recognized Trans-Dniester as autonomous within a single state and began a reform program to stimulate the weak economy. A strong Communist showing in 1998 legislative elections made this agenda more difficult to establish. The slow pace of reform led Prime Minister Ion Ciubuc to resign in Feb. 1999 (replaced by Ion Sturza) and Pres. Lucinschi to propose a referendum to increase the constitutional powers of the president, a model more in accord with the other ex-Soviet states. Elections in Feb. 2001 gave the Communists a majority in parliament which selected Vladimir Voronin as president and Vasile Tarlev as prime minister. In November, Voronin and Russia's president Putin agreed to seek a “political” solution to the problem of Moldova's secessionist and Russian-dominated “Republic of Trans-Dniester.” Moldova"},{"year":"2004","title":"GEOGRAPHY Location: Pacific coast of Central America.

A number of Indian tribes, of which the Pipil were dominant, originally inhabited the area now called El Salvador. The native population resisted the first attempt at Spanish colonization, begun in 1524, for almost 15 years. In 1821 El Salvador gained its independence from Spain, first as a jurisdiction under the Mexican empire and two years later as a member of the United Provinces of Central America. The Central American Federation collapsed in 1838, and in 1840 El Salvador emerged from a bloody two-year struggle as an independent republic. The Salvadoran economy was dominated by coffee production from the 1860's onward, and a series of laws in the 1880's allowed for concentration of both land ownership and political power in the hands of a coffee oligarchy. In 1931 a reformist president won election, but the military subsequently dismissed him. A revolt ensued (1932) in which 10,000 to 20,000 Salvadorans—mostly peasants—were killed. The result of the massacre, which was called La Matanza, was a period of relative political stability that lasted until the 1970's. In 1979 a political coup led by a group of junior military officers overthrew Pres. Gen. Carlos Humberto Romero. Owing to the polarization between conservative and reformist political groups, the first two civilian-military juntas resigned as a result of their failure to have their programs implemented by the military. A third government, which included Christian Democrat José Napoleón Duarte, took over on Mar. 5, 1980, on the basis of an armed forces' pledge to carry out an agrarian reform program. In 1980 the coalition of opposition political organizations became the Democratic Revolutionary Front (FDR), and five revolutionary military organizations consolidated under the banner of the Farabundo Marti Front for National Liberation (FMLN). Six social-democratic political leaders were assassinated in November 1980, further cementing the political opposition around the FMLN-FDR coalition. A three-part agrarian reform program was initiated in 1980 in El Salvador, but the central part of the program—to redistribute most of the land involved in export agriculture—was dropped as a result of opposition from the agricultural elite. In March 1982 elections for a constituent assembly, a majority of seats went to the rightist ARENA coalition. In December 1983 a new constitution went into effect, and in 1984 Christian Democrat José Napoleón Duarte assumed the presidency. In 1989, Alfredo Cristiani of the conservative Alliance for National Renovation was elected president. On Nov. 11, 1989, FMLN guerrillas launched a new offensive that lasted for several weeks before fading away. The government's failure to prosecute military officers implicated in the murder of six Jesuit priests shortly thereafter jeopardized U.S. military aid, which totaled $6 billion between 1979 and 1992. In January 1992, the government signed a peace treaty with the FMLN and the 12-year civil war, in which 70,000 people died, officially ended on December 15. The treaty called for the military to cut its forces by almost half (to 31,000 soldiers), and for the FMLN to lay down its arms and become a political party. A U.N.-sponsored Truth Commission found that 85 percent of all human-rights violations during the war were attributable to the Salvadoran army, security forces, or intelligence-unit death squads. Although the legislature narrowly passed a general amnesty for public officials, military officers, and political party leaders linked to human rights violations in March of 1993, the United States tried to link further military aid to the dismissal of the worst offenders in the military. In the March 1994 elections, ARENA's candidate Armando Calderon Sol was elected president. ARENA also carried half the seats in the National Assembly. In the 1997 mid-term election, FMLN made a vary strong showing running virtually even with ARENA on the national level. In the March 1999 elections, ARENA and the FMLN carried almost the same number of seats in the National Assembly, but in the presidential election, ARENA easily won for the third straight time, their candidate (Francisco Flores Perez) gaining 51 percent of the vote, with the FMLN candidate winning only 29 percent.

Ratings and running times are in parentheses.    Now Playing    * ''THE BOURNE SUPREMACY,'' starring Matt Damon. Directed by Paul Greengrass (PG-13","excerpt":"120 minutes). It may sound odd to call a chilly, paranoid thriller entertainment comfort food. But in the wake of 9/11 this globe-trotting post-cold-war melodrama full of standard cloak-and-dagger intrigue has the reassuring aroma of a home-cooked meal. There are no jihads or terrorists in sight and no apocalyptic scenarios, only dirty little secrets, as spies and counterspies from Russia and the United States tangle in a grubby story involving oil, sold secrets, murders and cover-ups. In this sequel to ''The Bourne Identity,'' many of the major hands who created the first film have returned, including Mr. Damon as Jason Bourne, the C.I.A.-trained assassin who still has serious memory problems and can't recall why he is being hunted by everybody, although blurry flashbacks leave him with clues. As before, he spends almost the entire movie on the run. The thriller reminds you that rhythms of film editing and collage-making have allowed Hollywood to make the chase movie a surefire format. Plot and character ultimately don't matter much in a film that's all about building and sustaining a mood in which visceral and emotional rhythms are blended into a high-gloss thrill ride (Stephen Holden).
