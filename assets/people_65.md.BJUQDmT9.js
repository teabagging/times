In this exhibition, Mr. Nygren, who is curator of collections at the Corcoran Gallery in Washington, D.C., demonstrates that the tradition in American landscape painting goes back as early as the 17th century and really takes off after 1790.\\n\\nTo prove his point, he ransacked numerous obscure collections, at home and abroad, and came up with a remarkable assembly of some 158 paintings, watercolors, engravings and drawings as well as books. His discoveries include landscapes by painters not normally associated with such painting - Benjamin West and John Trumbull in particular - and even painters such as John Smibert, an early 18th-century master of the bluntly realist portrait who also painted landscapes on occasion. The later finds include works by some artists who deserved to be remembered more than they are - notably George Beck, William Russell Birch, Francis Guy, Henry Cheever Pratt and William Guy Wall.

And one of Catherwood's drawings is of precisely the same subject as a photograph taken for Maudslay by a photographer named H.N. Sweet.\\n\\nMaudslay and Catherwood shared a common aim: to make the most accurate records possible of what are still, even today, among mankind's most mysterious monuments, and both of them had in mind that their pictures of these strange structures would eventually reach the public in the form of printed reproductions. However, between the early 1840's, when Catherwood was in Maya country, and the 1880's, when Maudslay was there, two technological revolutions in picture-making and picture reproduction had taken place that radically altered the means at their disposal. The first of these was the introduction of photography. The second was the development of photo-mechanical reproduction.

The movie honors its source with vigor and gusto, capturing both Waugh's cheeky humor and his dark, stringent moralism. Stephen Campbell Moore and Emily Mortimer are touching and funny as the central couple, an impecunious aristocrat named Adam Symes and his long-term fiancée, Nina, but the picture is brought to life by its large supporting cast of both well-known and unknown British actors (and one Canadian, Dan Ackroyd, playing a blustering press baron). The chaotic plot follows a gaggle of twittering, gilded youth through the cynical, gossip-ridden social whirl of pre-World War II Britain. The parallels with the present are obvious without being overdone, and Mr. Fry's exuberant, occasionally messy film departs from the usual stuffy conventions of costume drama. — A. O.

The answer is that they don't have a mandate to transform the community into a state in the first place, and in the second that their assigned task is to run what is in fact a ''zollverein'' - a union of states for the maintenance of a uniform tariff on imports from other countries, and of free trading among themselves.    That this is what the European Economic Community essentially is should throw some light on both Miss Lewis's observation that it has ''bogged down into a grab bag for small favors'' and the two remarks with which she backs it up: ''The big issue at the last summit session in Dublin was wine.

This prodigiously gifted architect lives right here.   At least we get to see the models. Mr. Vinoly's plans for the Tokyo International Forum are on view now in the architecture and design galleries at the Museum of Modern Art, as part of the museum's continuing series of shows devoted to important public works. This is the first show in the series to feature a single project by one firm, and the honor is richly deserved. The $1 billion project, which will be completed in 1996, is one of the largest under construction in the world today. It is also among the most sublime. Mr. Vinoly's design goes far toward dispelling disillusionment with the bloated scale of recent civic projects. And it revives faith in architecture as an instrument of intellectual clarity.

This occurred twice in recent auctions in New York, sales that attracted two quite different types of collectors. In one case a 1920's tea gown by Mariano Fortuny, the Venetian artist-designer, sold for $7,000, a record for the designer and the highest price ever paid at public sale for a period gown. In the other auction, a pair of ruby red silk slippers worn by Judy Garland as Dorothy in ''The Wiza rd of Oz'' sold for $12,000.Both prices are astounding considerin g the fact that the market for vintage clothing and other collect ibles is, according to many observors, now undergoing a mild recessi on.   What may prove to be an even more exciting challenge to the market is the offering of what is a remarkable rarity - a suit by Coco Chanel dating from 1926 or 1927. The three-piece, silk-lined, feather-light wool classic consists of a skirt with camisole top, a blouse and jacket in buff and Navy blue.

Mr. Mayer, interested only in widening the frontiers of human ken, is adding to the sum of common knowledge this week with a screen treatment of electrodynamics at his Rialto Theatre. The title of the discussion is \\"Bad Guy.\\"\\"Bad Guy\\" shows how man has mastered high-frequency currents, permitting him to hurl laboratory thunderbolts, etc., the way the late Mr. Steinmetz used to do. As a dramatic hot-shot to liven up what otherwise might have been a sluggish lecture, the film introduces Bruce Cabot as an intrepid power lineman who steels himself for his calling with extra-curricular pursuits like murder, jailbreak and love-theft. Mr. Cabot was in the act of telling two electricians, from a cell in the death house, what was wrong with the hot seat they were preparing for him when this reviewer came in.A commutation of sentence saves him for the picture, however, parole following closely upon an act of heroism in the prison yard. Mr. Cabot then goes forth to a career of high-tension swashbuckling, stealing his doting brother's girl while the brother attends lectures","excerpt":"violating parole, breaking jail and winding up a career of folly by shinnying out on a power line with the cops in pursuit.

In this boisterous affair, Wallace Beery and Raymond Hatton return to France, where they are once more engaged in burlesquing the World War. They only fight among themselves, however, and Mr. Beery, under the delightful appellation of Louie Hozenozzle, informs Lieutenant Rodney Ramsbottom (Mr. Hatton) that \\"guys like him in the army is what makes the navy so overcrowded.\\"Mr. Beery leaps from making army cakes to being an Alpine guide. The various disputes he has with Ramsbottom necessitate the use of dough and swords and in one stretch the stalwart Hozenozzle steals Lieutenant Ramsbottom's uniform so as to curry favor with the French girls, who have already let Hozenozzle know that they do not care to be seen out with \\"common privates.\\"In one chapter the bearded Mayor of the French village is sorely in need of a mountain guide, as the thirteenth was killed the previous day. He and others succeed in prevailing upon Hozenozzle to take on the hazardous work. They first test his possibilities as a yodler and discovering that his lungpower is satisfactory, they warn him that while yodling will stop an avalanche, sneezing will cause disaster. Hence you have a series of scenes in which there is no little sneezing and periodical avalanches.When the intrepid Hozenozzle is being photographed he is not a little concerned at the private cemetery for Alpine guides. He, for the nonce, is named \\"Louie the Fourteenth.\\" It is then that one concludes that there is a vague suggestion of the Ziegfeld stage production, \\"Louie the 14th,\\" on which, it is set forth in the program, this contraption claims to be based.When they tire of snow and ice, Ralph Cedar, the director, takes his lopsided team to an inn, where Mr. Beery is permitted to make himself ridiculous in a nightgown and nightcap. Zealously they try to stir up fun with swords of different sizes and toward the end Hozenozzle and Ramsbottom together attack Colonel Lavoris, an officer, described by George Marion Jr. in one of the subtitles as having \\"won the nom de plume after having missed the croix de guerre.\\"This picture appears to have been produced in haste. It, of course, belongs to the same species of nonsense as other pseudo comedies in which the Beery-Hatton team have been seen.
