Some of the stories he'll spin tomorrow night will also be a little scary. Families can listen as they sit outdoors near a campfire, behind the Richmondtown Restoration tinsmith's shop. Everyone is encouraged to bring a blanket or a beach chair to sit on, though benches will be provided for those who forget. The storytelling lasts about two hours, with a break midway for sustenance: hot chocolate and doughnuts (about 50 cents each). The moon was officially full on Wednesday, but it should still shed a good dose of light tomorrow. Admission to the storytelling, which starts promptly at 7:30 P.M., is $7 for nonmember adults and $5 for members; $3.50 for nonmember children and $2.50 for member children.

The less courageous can merely head over to the kiddie carnival on the Nethermead and partake in such harmless activities as toss games, dancing, singing or eating.

Argentina Ziegler, from Panama, will regale zoogoers with her own animal stories, and the Bat Cart, a resource of bat facts, will show children how to build their own bat box to hang outdoors and attract the flying marsupials.

But this is the end result of talents—obviously adult—that deserves to be noticed. For, despite the fact that the director, Joseph Losey","excerpt":"the producer, S. P. Eagle, and their cast are unfolding an unusual and sometimes sordid tale in which the chief protagonists garner little sympathy, it is a story spun with conviction and mounting force. The people of \\"The Prowler\\" are decidedly off the norm and it is a tribute to them that they stand out with such clarity.Hugo Butler, who adapted the original yarn by Robert Thoeren and Hans Wilhelm, has approached his subject with refreshing frankness. But this is candor that does not besmirch the mind. Although the script is pointed in discussing the extramarital affair between a bitter and grasping cop and the married but lonely woman whose love and legacy he steals, it does not strain credulity. Webb Garwood is a patrolman whose character is developed neatly as a malcontent who once found out that venality did not pay off. When he first meets Susan Gilvray—who is married to a rich, middle-aged disc jockey—on a routine check for a prowler she imagines is haunting her house—he knows at once that she is desirable in more ways than one.Fashioning an elaborate and subtle scheme, he succeeds in eliminating her husband and shortly thereafter takes the once suspicious but now love happy lady as his legal bride. Her dowry gives him the motel he has desired as evidence of his place in the sun. But the discovery on their honeymoon that they are approaching parenthood too, soon makes their position untenable, since both know that the lady's late husband was incapable of fatherhood, a fact that would make this eventuality highly suspicious. And, in their attempt to seek seclusion during the trying days ahead, Susan not only learns the true nature of her lover's plotting but also sends him into the arms of justice.Neither Van Heflin nor Evelyn Keyes, as the strangely mated pair, are not people who fit in or are condoned by formal society. But credit must be given to Van Heflin in essaying an unsympathetic assignment. He is obviously a gambler willing to risk his life to attain those ends he deems best. And he is not a pat villian but a dastard who is human in his final breakdown when he says: \\"I did it for the $62,000 but I love you, you gotta give me credit for that.\\"Miss Keyes' unvarnished characterization also is one of many shades. She is pictured as a woman whose basic decencies rebel against this fatal attraction but she also is feminine enough to surrender to this profound emotion. Although her liaison is sleazy she redeems her lot in part by her final effort to reject the man she loves.John Maxwell, as the veteran cop and Heflin's unsuspecting partner, heads the supporting cast, who give a documentary like feeling to their brief portrayals. And the producer and director have distilled picturesque effects from the ghost town which is used for the climactic scenes. \\"The Prowler,\\" in short, is dignified and often exciting, despite its unsavory theme. Unusual Drama Opens at Criterion"},{"year":"1951","title":"Since Ludwig van Beethoven has been admitted into the pantheon of music, it is natural that his film biographers regard him with reverence. But in \\"Eroica,\\" the Austrian-made story of the composer, that came to the Fifty-fifth Street Playhouse on Saturday, this profound respect has served merely to cloud a titanic figure.Beethoven, as \\"depicted here, is simply a moody and sometimes tormented soul, who only indicates the greatness of the man he is portraying through lengthy and none too persuasive dialogue. And his associates are shadowy figures in the background of a history that just slightly touches the powerful drama inherent in the music master's life.Perhaps the producers were aware of the enormity of their task. For they have chosen only the highlights in the troubled genius' career. It is the mature Beethoven they are considering, the Beethoven who, feeling that Napoleon epitomized liberty, fraternity, equality, decided to write and dedicate to the Emperor his \\"Eroica\\" symphony.Hardly is this done than the composer is shown having a change of heart. From this abrupt transition the story is switched to the romantic aspects of the Beethoven story. His loves—there are two women involved—are high born ladies whose passions are kindled quickly, but these are a pair of lofty affairs. The ladies and Beethoven speak of their amours, but these are loves without fire and somehow without conviction.In the final aspect shown","excerpt":"the producers have managed to convey some of the turbulence, frustration and despair of the composer, who learns that deafness is overtaking him. Compassion is felt for the man, who rails against heaven for robbing him of his hearing. And one does sense Beethoven's realization that despite this great loss he has been tested by God and henceforth will create music from his inner self.Ewald Balser, who, physically approximates Beethoven, is given to posing and gesturing in the early sequences of the biography, but does himself and the film credit in delineating the agonized man who knows his deafness will drive him into a silent and lonely world. Marianne Schoenauer and Judith Holzmeister are beautiful as the ladies of the Austrian court whom he loves, but these are liaisons that leave the impression they are surface affairs.Dagny Servaes and Oskar Werner, as Beethoven's sister-in-law and nephew, contribute the film's sole light moments as they deftly portray an opportunistic shrew and a lazy ne'er do well, respectively. And Ivan Petrovich is seen fleetingly as Beethoven's patron.Olin Downes, this newspaper's music critic, who is credited with editing and subtitling, has done a commendable job in translating the German dialogue into fairly literal but lucid English.Music lovers who will be expecting full transcriptions of the composer's masterpieces will be disappointed. However, the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra and the Vienna Symphonic Orchestra under the baton of Hans Knappertsbusch, and the Vienna State Opera Choir and the Vienna Choir Boys do justice to excerpts of his work. Included are sections from the \\"Eroica,\\" the Ninth, Sixth and Seventh Symphonies; the \\"Moonlight Sonata; the \\"Leonore No. 3,\\" Overture to \\"Fidelio,\\" the Prisoner's Chorus from \\"Fidelio\\" and the overtures to \\"Coriolanus\\" and \\"Egmont.\\"Despite the wealth of source material, however, \\"Eroica\\" is not nearly as heroic or majestic as its subject.

The young French actress, whose name you must pronounce as See-MOAN See-MOAN unless you want to be blamed for a suicide epidemic in Twentieth Century-Fox's advertising department, had an astonishing début at the Roxy yesterday in \\"Girls' Dormitory.\\" Virtually unknown here before the picture was screened, she had become a star of the first magnitude at its conclusion. No wonder we have been lurching about ever since amid blathering phrases like \\"Hands across the sea,\\" \\"Lafayette, we are here\\" and \\"Darryl Zanuck, we who are about to die salute you.\\"As an introductory package, \\"Girls' Dormitory\\" affords her an extremely limited range. This is uncommon. The typical début picture permits its star to run the well-known gamut from Z to A, with stopovers at chi, psi and theta. It is indicative of Miss Simon's unusual personality and unusual quality as an actress that her performance, while eloquent in character, has overtones which convince us she is not merely playing a rôle for which nature and a prescient casting director intended her. She is not, to put it succinctly, just another Betty Bronson in \\"Peter Pan.\\"Here, in her first Hollywood rôle, she is Marie Claudel, a schoolgirl in love with the Herr Direktor Stephen Dominik, headmaster of a girls' school in Switzerland. A fortunate man, the Herr Direktor, for he is loved, too, by one of his faculty, Professor Ann Mathe. But, absorbed in his writing of textbooks on ancient history, he is blind alike to the sparkling adoration of the former and to the tender, generous worship of the latter. Then a loveletter is found in a waste-basket. Obviously written by one of the girls in the school, unsigned and unaddressed, it speaks caressingly of the rapturous moments she spent in her lover's arms. The writing is traced to Marie and, although she confesses it was only a make-believe letter, she is brought before a faculty examination and ordered to name the man.She chooses as her confidante the very Professor Mathe who has hoped for years to hear a declaration of love from the schoolmaster's lips. Professor Mathe promises to guard her secret, but other members of the faculty—less generously inclined—insist that the matter be brought to the attention of the girl's invalid mother. She takes flight, is followed by Dr. Dominik—and, we are very much afraid, the Hollywood inevitable occurs, even to the scene of renunciation when Marie discovers Ann's love for the school's director and a decidedly unsatisfactory happy ending.For this should have been, as it started out to be, a poignant tale of breathless young infatuation and transient despair. It should have preserved the delicate tragedy of that moment when Marie approached the Herr Direktor at the wine garden picnic and asked him to dance and was refused. It should have clung to the idealistic beauty it reflected as the schoolgirl stood before her god and was taxed for her unworthiness. The mood and the tone of \\"Girls' Dormitory\\" is that of a sad-sweet day in Spring","excerpt":"the producers would have been wiser not to jeopardize it with a saccharine and hopelessly implausible conclusion.This is Miss Simon's picture, but there must be recognition of the splendid work of her first Hollywood supporting cast: of Ruth Chatterton as Ann Mathe, Constance Collier as the martinet, Professor Wimmer, J. Edward Bromberg as the probing Dr. Spindler, of Frank Reicher and George Hassell as sympathetic faculty members. Herbert Marshall has used his dying-cow expression too often.

''You lost your job in Kansas City to Jim Wohlford.'' But after the 1973 season, the Yankees liberated Lou Piniella from the Royals in a trade for the relief pitcher Lindy McDaniel. As for Jim Wohlford, he's out of baseball now. And as for Lou Piniella, he's not about to lose his Yankee job to anybody unless George Steinbrenner makes the mistake of letting him walk away as a free agent. Lou Piniella's job, as he describes it, is ''to help produce runs,'' primarily as a 38-year-old designated hitter against left-handed pitchers. He's really a p.h., as in professional hitter.  In the Yankees' 13-3 victory yesterday that gave them a 2-0 lead in the American League championship series, which resumes tonight in Oakland, he was sitting in the dugout when Reggie Jackson strained his left calf jogging to right field for the third inning.

Pennebaker's film \\"Company,\\" about recording the original cast album of Stephen Sondheim's 1971 musical. Starting Dec. 14, it plays at the Public Theater daily except Mondays at 6:30 P.M through mid-January. Not to miss: Elaine Stritch (above) and her nth take of \\"The Ladies Who Lunch.\\" No Dancing at 'Buddy'     If you plan to see \\"Buddy,\\" the musical based on the life of the rock singer Buddy Holly, you might want to pop for an orchestra seat. The high volume rock-and-roll show had so many opening-night revelers dancing in the aisles that the 77-year-old Shubert Theater's mezzanine and balcony started to shake along with the dancers. A structural engineer was called in to examine the premises, which were certainly not built to accommodate the Meadowlands crowd. Besides any structural worry, the other concern is the steep rake of the seats, which makes it too easy for patrons to lose their balance and pitch forward.   One suggestion the engineer made was to install some poles, which a theater staffer says would turn a number of perfectly good seats into obstructed-view locations. Philip J. Smith, the Shubert Organization's executive vice president, says the problem has been solved by less drastic means. Large signs warning \\"No Dancing\\" have been posted in both the mezzanine and the balcony","excerpt":"the programs at each performance are stuffed with \\"no dancing\\" notices, and the ushers flash their lights at anyone with the urge to rock-and-roll. If an overly enthusiastic patron doesn't stop, the Shubert's security officers appear.   Mr. Smith maintains that these measures have worked. \\"When we got the results of the engineering study, we determined that the poles were not necessary,\\" he says. \\"But if there was any doubt of safety at all, we would have installed them immediately, whether they obstructed 2 seats or 200. Safety is our major concern.\\" Tyne Daly May Return     The talk backstage at \\"Gypsy\\" is that Tyne Daly is coming back. Linda Lavin's contract with the show is up on Jan. 7, and Barry Weissler, a co-producer, says he is negotiating with Ms. Daly's agent for her return. \\"We are fairly certain that she would like to do this,\\" he says. \\"If she does come back, it will be in February or the beginning of March.\\" Whether Ms. Daly would play a limited run on Broadway that would serve as a warmup for a London production next summer is still undecided. But Mr. Weissler says, \\"Regardless ofBroadway, she has guaranteed me that she'll star in the London company of 'Gypsy' for six months.\\"   Will Ms. Lavin extend her contract until Ms. Daly returns? Some company members aren't sure, and speculations on a replacement range from Liza Minnelli (not true, says the co-producer Fran Weissler; Ms. Minnelli is doing a concert at Radio City Music Hall instead) to Chita Rivera (not true, Mr. Weissler says). In the interim, he says, \\"It will be Linda or no one.\\" Water by the Bucket    There was some high drama Tuesday night at the first preview of \\"The Big Funk,\\" the new play by the Oscar-winning screenwriter (\\"Moonstruck\\") John Patrick Shanley at the Public Theater. Scheduled to open on Dec. 10, it is billed as a \\"comedy about grease, water, nudity and a good mirror.\\" The water, though, was scarce. About noon on Tuesday, a water-main break at Fourth Street and Lafayette Avenue cut off the theater's supply. In the first act, the actress Jeanne Tripplehorn is covered in K-Y jelly, then jumps into a bubble bath to wash off. The production stage manager, Pamela Singer, says it took 25 gallons of the Public's bottled water to fill the bath, but there was still jelly in Ms. Tripplehorn's hair. Fifteen more gallons solved that problem. But offstage Ms. Tripplehorn, still covered with bubble bath, shampoo and K-Y, was without a shower.   Mr. Shanley, who is also directing the play, remained calm. \\"During previews of 'Danny and the Deep Blue Sea,' we had a flood in the dressing rooms. During 'Savage in Limbo,' there was a massive plumbing leak on the roof during rehearsals. I would be worried about this except that by a fluke the sprinkler system had gone off the week before and flooded the theater. So I've had every kind of weather. And I'm indoors.\\" Redgrave Withdraws From 'Ghosts'    Don't look for Vanessa Redgrave this spring at Circle in the Square, where she was to star in Ibsen's \\"Ghosts.\\" Her lawyer in London, James Sharkey, says the actress recently wrote to Circle's artistic director, Ted Mann, sending her regrets. It seems that the reason for her absence is a universal one: she needs to make money.   \\"She's had to postpone until next season,\\" Mr. Mann says. \\"She's doing 'The Three Sisters' in England at a very low salary, so for financial necessity, she's had to put this off a year.\\"   Although there is some vague talk about a film for Ms. Redgrave, most theater executives bet on her taking \\"Lettice and Lovage\\" on tour. Mr. Sharkey says: \\"She is contemplating that proposal at the moment. But there are so many different calls on her time.\\" Mr. Mann says no plans have been made on what will fill the \\"Ghosts\\" slot. Lortel's Gift     The eightysomething producer Lucille Lortel is to be honored next week when a room named for her opens at the New York Public Library at Lincoln Center. It will be the new viewing area for the Library's Theater on Film and Tape Archive. With its collection of 1,600 performances from Broadway, Off Broadway and regional theater, interviews with notable theater personalities (among them Eva Le Gallienne and Richard Rodgers) and other theater-related programs, the archive is the largest of its kind in the world. Miss Lortel's endowment of an undisclosed sum will increase the number of television sets in the room and pay the program's five-person staff.   Why did she do it? \\"Jerry Robbins wrote to me saying he had heard that I was considering it,\\" Miss Lortel says. \\"He has a room there himself, and said it has given him more pleasure than anything he's done in his life.\\"   What should give the program's 3,000 viewers a year even more pleasure is that one wall of the room will be covered with memorabilia of Miss Lortel's life in the theater. \\"It's not a big room,\\" she says. \\"It must have been some storage space, really.

Is accelerated depreciation necessary or desirable as an investment incentive? Neither question is susceptible to a simple yes or no answer. Clearly, however, the President's proposal for reforming depreciation policy is a significant improvement over the existing Accelerated Cost Recovery System - although a step backward from the first Treasury proposal. It provides badly needed flexibility and removes the arbitrariness that has made accelerated depreciation a vulnerable political target.\\n\\nTo illustrate the inflexibility of the present depreciation system, consider this: Most types of equipment are grouped into a single class and assigned a five-year write-off period. This means that equipment such as computers, which rapidly become obsolete, are treated the same as long-lived assets such as ships. As a result, the tax code distorts investment, favoring some types of equipment.

It is a talking picture known as \\"Thru Different Eyes,\\" and is an adaptation of a play by Milton Herbert Gropper and Edna Sherry. Its shining opportunities for original treatment, pictorially and audibly, have been seized upon most adroitly by John Blystone, under whose sagacious guidance Mary Duncan, Warner Baxter and Edmund Lowe give capital impersonations.Mr. Blystone, without being extravagant, has made good use of the tonal quality of this production, whether by the noise of typewriters, telegraph machines or the more agreeable sound of a steamship's whistle. During one passage, Mary Duncan, after singing a song at a piano, goes about from room to room, singing and humming in a pleasingly natural fashion.The three moods of this production reveal the defendant's counsel's conception of how Jack Winfield met his death","excerpt":"the prosecutor's notion of how it happened, and, lastly, the true description. In a most interesting and imaginative fashion Mr. Blystone depicts the prejudiced viewpoints of the two lawyers. The defendant's attorney is almost tedious in his narration of the sobriety and domestic felicity of Harvey Manning and his wife, Viola. In fact, Manning takes so long to say good-bye to his charming wife that yesterday afternoon the audience became visibly impatient. On the other hand, the inebriety and infidelity of the Mannings, so vividly sketched by the prosecuting lawyer, was received with outbursts of laughter and periods of genuine excitement, which proves that there are times when people don't wish to see model husbands and wives.These contrasting episodes, in which each lawyer shows the way he thinks Winfield was killed, are pictured with just enough of the court room so that one does not forget the trial. These flashbacks appear in a dissolve from the court room as the voice of one of the two attorneys dies away.After showing the reporters' room and persons trying to obtain admission to the trial, the picture swings to the defendant's counsel summing up his case before the twelve good men (and women) and true. As that scene slowly fades from view, one comes to a bridge game in the home of the Mannings. It has evidently been one of those rare bridge games in which there has not been a discordant note between husbands and wives! And then the film proceeds to tell of the defense's theory regarding Winfield's death.In the next series of scenes, after the District Attorney's introductory remarks on his idea of how Winfield was murdered, one is confronted with an entirely different sight in the Mannings' home. There are bottles and glasses, and while nobody but a chauffeur is actually the worse for alcohol, it is plain that Mrs. Manning is anxious to have her husband leave the house so that she can receive Jack Winfield, with whom she is presumed by the District Attorney to have fallen in love while Winfield was painting her portrait.Very cleverly Mary Duncan portrays the giddy creature awaiting Winfield. She is light-hearted, singing and humming as she goes about the place, and finally she decides to put on a flimsy négligée and spray herself with perfume. Warner Baxter, who had been seen in the previous scene as a high-strung artist, is now quite perturbed at Mrs. Manning's protestations of affection. Winfield is leaving for Italy and Mrs. Manning, tired of life with her husband, is only too eager to leave with him.The truth comes from an unexpected source after the verdict of the jury. It is set forth with a degree of plausibility and is, of course, all the more interesting because of the opinions of the crime that have preceded it.The flashes of the court room are peculiarly well filmed, with just enough humor to lighten the drama. There is the newspaper reporter from Paducah and other characters.The diction of all is well recorded. It gives a distinctive individuality to each voice and Miss Duncan is, as one might expect, uncommonly able. Her voice is pleasing without being in the least affected. She appears to be quite at home before the usually awe-inspiring microphone. Edmund Loew's capability is revealed by the transitions in his demeanor in the three episodes. Mr. Baxter is excellent. He first gives one the impression of a nervous artist, then of a sane, calm individual, and finally of a hard, selfish, unscrupulous specimen.The stage contributions of the ever alert Mr. Rothafel are resplendent as usual. The pièce de résistance of the colorful contributions is one referred to in the program as \\"National Sports Silk Week,\\" in which the Roxyette dancers are first perceived as a giant silkworm. Following this there is a Japanese scene with silk kimonos worn by the performers, after which the stage is filled by girls arrayed in up-to-date sports frocks and dresses. This helps Mr. Rothafel, who in the last year has become a rabid golf enthusiast, to give his favorite recreation a chance from the Roxy stage. To do this adequately, Joe Kirkwood, the celebrated trick-shot golfer, is seen in an exhibition of his prowess at the royal and ancient game by driving a golf ball off the foot and the chin of a demure girl.

But the case of Ivo Pogorelich has never been a typical one, and on Friday night in Avery Fisher Hall, in the second of two concerts in a month, it was impossible to ignore the bio note, presumably written with the pianist's approval. It helped illuminate the striking and indulgent pianism that marked this sold-out recital, the sense of a strong talent testing his limits.    Mr. Pogorelich's biography, in fact, has been inseparable from his playing. When he lost the 1980 Warsaw International Chopin Competition, the pianist Martha Argerich was so upset she resigned from the jury in protest. In succeeding years the Yugoslav musician, born in 1958, affected a manner of cool nonchalance, along with unconventional concert dress. He was granted a Deutsche Grammophon contract in 1981 and has since become one of the best-selling classical artists. Mr. Pogorelich has seemed to know what balance to strike among iconoclasm, manipulation and seriousness.

It's unsettling when judges hurl thunderbolts -and themselves - into political thickets.

The director has assembled an intriguing portrait gallery of stock characters plucked from Toulouse-Lautrec paintings and the novels of Jean Genet.

A gentle esthete with a passion for collecting late-19th-century bric-a-brac, Charlotte projects the flighty gentility of an eccentric older woman who couldn't hurt a fly.

We are beginning to find out. Half of all marriages in this country end in divorce, and half of all children will spend a significant period with only one parent.   Startling and unsettling changes have already oc-curred in black family life, especially among the poor. Since the 1960's, birth rates among blacks have fallen dramatically, but two out of every three black women having a first child are single, compared to one out of every six white women. Today, well over half of black children in this country are born to single women. Why are female-headed households multiplying now, when there is less discrimination and poverty than a couple of generations ago, when black family life was stronger?   The disruption of the black family today is, in exaggerated microcosm, a reflection of what has happened to American family life in general. Public anxiety has mounted with the near-doubling of the proportion of white children living with one parent (from 9 percent to 17 percent) since 1970. Single parents of all backgrounds are feeling the pressures - the sheer economics of raising children primarily on the depressed income of the mother (a large component of the so-called ''feminization of poverty'')","excerpt":"the psychological and physical toll when one person, however advantaged, must be both mother and father, and the effects on children.

The editor Donatella Sartorio and the photographer Paolo Leone scoured the country, from Casa Degli Atellani in Milan (above left) to the Villa Rae in Naples (above right), in search of what the Tod’s president and chairman, Diego Della Valle, describes as “the character of contemporary Italian aristocracy: real people, involved and passionate about their work and dreams, who live both in great cities and the country, and who feel luxury as something innate.” The book captures a broad landscape, including blue bloods of fashion (the editor Anna Dello Russo","excerpt":"the public relations consultant Noona Smith-Petersen), design (the architect Benedetto Camerana; the interior decorator Alessia Bianchi Bormioli) and bona fide aristocracy (various princes from Tuscany and Sicily), shot in their natural habitats — a cast for whom all of the trappings of the good life fit as comfortably as, well, a pair of Tod’s fabled driving shoes.

They were protesting the publishing industry's ''antiquated'' and ''unimaginative'' book selling methods. Nowadays, authors still bridle at the way publishers handle their books, but they are taking to the courts, rather than the streets. The result so far has been a few wins, one draw and a great deal of industry soul searching.Last year, a writer named Bill Starr won a suit in Municipal Small Claims Court in Los Angeles against Pinnacle Books, which Mr. Starr accused of failing to market and advertise in good faith his novel ''Chance Fortune.'' ''The defense asked whether I knew there were writers of different quality,'' said Marvin Gevurtz, who presided over the hearing.  ''My response was that if you feel a person is untalented or unworthy of a full-faith effort, you shouldn't enter into a contract with him.'' Last month, in an out-of-court settlement of another suit, Harcourt Brace Jovanovich paid $100,000 to Deborah Davis, author of ''Katharine the Great,'' a 1979 biography of Katharine Graham, chairman of the Washington Post Company.

Let us hope this is only a defection of Anne Burnaby and Ronald Jeans, who are responsible for the writing in this item, else we're in for it (as they say), indeed.For what we have in this picure, which might courteously be termed a comedy, is as dismal a domestic situation as ever leaked from an uninspired brain.It seems there are two young British couples—Sabina and Rodney are one and Bruce and Mary the other—living together with their respective tots in one house, along with a pretty young numbskull who is providentially unwed. One aspect of their jolly disorder is the difficulty they have keeping a nurse —or Nanny, as everyone calls her—because Sabina has such a blunt, impulsive tongue. And when they finally do get one that looks like an absolute gem, they run into further difficulties because Sabina is impulsive, too, toward men.Not only is there Victor, who has been toothily wooing her for years (and to whom she eventually surrenders so far as to say, \\"Do you really think I am desirable or are you just being polite?\\"), but there is Bruce whom, in an abandoned moment, she sweeps into a ladylike embrace. Unfortunately, on each occasion, other people pop into the room—including that gem of a Nanny, who is utterly horrified. Everyone has a lot of answering to do for all the kissing that takes place before order is restored in the household and husbands pair off again with wives.To say that this nonsense is witless and foolish is putting it mildly. It is empty of inspiration, humor and even professional shame. And no matter how hard Joan Greenwood, Nigel Patrick, Derek Farr and others try—including that pretty Audrey Hepburn as the unwed boarder—it stays on the ground. It's the sort of thing that takes the magic out of marriage, as one of the characters brilliantly exclaims.

The experts say that by giving in to the demands of a Palestinian guerrilla leader, Ahmed Jabril, last month -a move widely viewed here as a blunder - Israel helped to create the atmosphere in which the Beirut hijacking took place.   Now, the experts argue, Israel is trying to compensate for this by refusing to concede to the hijackers' demands for the release of 766 detainees unless the United States formally appeals to the Israeli Government to, in effect, ''cave in'' to the demands.      Friction Between Allies   This has created a great deal of strain between Jerusalem and Washingtion, and officials here acknowledge that coordination between the two Governments has been inconsistent.   The result, said Zeev Schiff, the military editor of the daily newspaper Haaretz, is that the hijackers have already won a major victory: Israel and America, instead of fighting the hijackers jointly, are at odds with each other.

But most every president since World War II has shared the sentiment at times -- usually about France, but often about Germany or Europe in general.

Pataki, his Republican opponent, this is Mr. Cuomo's first spot in recent weeks that focuses on his own record and plans. It operates on several levels. He lets viewers see his family -- a textbook trick for politicians seeking to seem softer or more human -- and says he has a personal reason to share their worries. He defends his record, which he has not always found easy because of his opposition to the death penalty. Finally, he says that fighting crime ultimately hinges on prevention, a message that sells big with his base of liberal and black Democratic voters.    Though firm, this is no war whoop on crime","excerpt":"the question is whether it is what most voters want to hear, especially from the incumbent who led the state during 12 violent years, despite three years of dropping crime statistics.

General Rogers, you have been calling for NATO spending increases of 4 percent a year to finance the so-called Rogers plan - the aim being to modernize conventional forces and thus make it less likely that nuclear weapons would need to be used in the early stage of a conflict.

It just took sick. Its leaves drooped, then its young shoots, and within three days I had given up even feeling its pulse. When life leaves a plant it is as plain as when it leaves an animal. The signal of the death of an animal is the stopping of its heartbeat. How can a plant, not equipped with a heart, or any vital organs, so clearly show signs of life, of sickness and of death?

It seems that, during the trial of Jew Suss, he taunted his judges with the reminder that they could not hang him higher than the gallows tree. Thereupon the vengeful jurists designed a special cage to carry him high above the noose. In the lingering finale of the new Music Hall drama, the throttling ceremony is consummated in the public square during a picturesque snowfall, and the townsfolk in vast numbers are assembled for the event. Since \\"Power,\\" under the unwieldy direction of Lothar Mendes, divides itself rather neatly into historical tableaux, it is no less than justice to isolate this lovingly photographed episode as the most striking part of a film which is always a little less than brilliantly convincing.What effectiveness there is in this pageant of Reb Joseph Suss Oppenheim and the eighteenth-century court of the Duke of Wuerttemberg must be credited to Conrad Veidt. His portrait of the Jewish apostate, always hovering between his lust for power and his loyalty to his faith, torn between his need for personal greatness and his deeprooted allegiance to his down-trodden fellows in the Wuerttemberg ghettoes, is a stimulating performance to watch. The Faust-like conflict of soul which he expresses so admirably manages to give meaning and importance to the rôle. Thus Mr. Veidt stands out as almost the sole merit of a photoplay which is muddy in its development and ornately uninspired in its general arrangement.The drama shows how Susz, in his cold and merciless rise to a position of power at the court of Karl Alexander is forced to sacrifice his personal integrity to his ambition. In order to maintain his position as a favorite of the boorish and rapacious Duke, he must become a partner to the kind of behavior which is repugnant to him. He is even forced to sacrifice to his monarch the one woman he loves. But when the Duke, in a drunken attempt to seduce the Jew's young daughter, is the cause of her suicide, Susz returns in horror to the faith which he had betrayed. Even when he discovers from his supposed mother that he is really a Christian, he refuses to desert his people. The final irony of his career takes place in the death cell when he is offered his freedom on condition that he turn Christian.It is the principal misfortune of \\"Power\\" that, amid the handsome historical settings, the narrative is muddled and the motivations are often obscure. Nor is the atmosphere improved by the well-bred Oxonian accents of the bearded and patriarchal Israelites. Some good players have been enlisted in Mr. Veidt's support, including Sir Cedric Hardwicke, Sir Gerald du Maurier, Benita Hume and Paul Graetz, but they are never quite convincing. Only Pamela Ostrer, as the Jew's daughter, succeeds in conveying an authentic emotion.The stage program at the Music Hall is \\"Footlight Flashes,\\" a Leonidoff program in three episodes: \\"Stars Fell on Alabama,\\" \\"Spotlight\\" and \\"Age of Chivalry.\\" THE SCREEN","excerpt":"The Radio City Music Hall Presents a British Screen Version of Lion Feuchtwanger's 'Power.'"},{"year":"1935","title":"Enchanting romantic comedy via Molnar play, adapted by Preston Sturges.

Occasionally, as a sign of rebellion, the band's guitarist, Paul Stanley, flung a leg over the padding and looked stuck. The vultures were flying overhead.    Kiss has been around since 1972 and is a grandparent of many of the heavy-metal bands touring the circuit today. With costumes and makeup, it brought a theatricality to rock that heavy-metal still has. At the Garden,shorn of makeup and dressed in standard black heavy-metal clothes, the group ran through a ritual of rebellion. Always a target of critics, the band swore at a few local newspapers. Mr. Stanley also suggested that \\"anybody who doesn't like rock-and-roll get out,\\" and that he had come to kick his home town's rear end. All of this was intended to keep alive the idea that rock rebellion still exists. Which it doesn't.    The show, which opened with fireworks, was there to fill a need not for surprise and improvisation, but the convention of rock-and-roll stadium shows, a modern version of bread and circuses. From the beginning of the show to the end, the group delivered entertainment, slamming through a string of past hits that opened up for chants that had the audience singing along. Fireworks erupted as routinely as Mr. Stanley's vulgarities, and broken, industrial-size pipes, which tried to give the stage a bit of a post-apocalyptic feel, spewed occasional bursts of fog. And the tempos of the tunes stayed fast. The dramatic convention here was one of fun; everybody understood the show was just a show, a way of celebrating a type of spirit and energy that has little practical use outside the auditorium.

This array of farcical scenes happens to be known as \\"His Tiger Lady,\\" but the ending is not left in doubt as it was in Francis R. Stockton's classic story. As a matter of record the lady in the case is never in the least danger of being clawed by the striped beast, and as matters turn out Mr. Menjou, as Henri the super, discovers to his great satisfaction that the tiger has breathed its last and that therefore he can enter the cage with a wonderful show of bravado. Hence, so long as you are not deeply moved by a tiger dying from acute indigestion this photoplay will afford a most enjoyable hour.Henri the super is a susceptible man who gazes with the eyes of adulation upon the Tiger Lady, an actress of repute and disrepute. She is surrounded by her duke, her marquis and her count, and courage is what she admires above everything. Henri possesses more cheek than courage. He is told that as a super he is but a number in the theatrical company, but Henri remembers that, super or not, he is clad on the stage as a dazzling rajah. He knows how futile it would be to try even to catch the eye of the Tiger Lady in his everyday clothes, so he decides to go forth one night arrayed in his stage costume.This fictitious Rajah in one sequence swaggers through a Paris restaurant. He wants a particular table, but the headwaiter reminds the noble Hindu guest that the table is already occupied by a regular customer, a gourmand, to whom eating is an art. Nevertheless Henri insists that he will sit at that special table only, and thereupon the maitre d'hôtel tactfully explains that Frenchmen ought to humor notables from another country. The gourmand acquiesces and soon the Rajah, his face more flushed than bronzed, with an eye for the Tiger Lady, begins his further assault on the patience of the maître d'hôtel. The Tiger Lady is duly impressed and after a wink she leaves her noble entourage and joins the Rajah. He does not wish to bother with ordering. Will the menials bring before him all the dishes on the menu? They are delighted to do so, and soon the Rajah is beheld giving a cursory and indifferent inspection to the marvelous specimens of culinary artistry.In due course of time the waiter deigns to slip the bill on the table, and as the Duke, the Marquis and the Count had joined the Tiger Lady at the Rajah's table the amount owed is not insignificant. It is, to be explicit, 19,587 francs. The Rajah cannot control a wry expression, but the Tiger Lady's trio is only too eager to settle the check. Even they are staggered at the charge for a relatively modest repast.Subsequently the placid but beautiful Tiger Lady invites the Rajah to her apartment. It is there that she tells him of her admiration for courage, and the test is one she has naïvely conjured up herself. She will go with the Rajah to the Paris Zoo in a day or so and throw her white, perfumed gloves into a tiger's cage. Will the Rajah's nerve permit him to enter the cage and snatch the gloves from the beast? The Rajah vows he loves the Tiger Lady more than life, and so, nervously, he consents to the test.That evening, as Herni, our hero, repairs to the zoo to see whether it is possible to make friends with a tiger, he meets the tiger, which is willing to eat, but evidently would rather eat Henri than anything else. Next morning Henri, in his wellbrushed dark suit and soft felt hat, again approaches the tiger. He is prepared for a further show of teeth and vicious snarls, but there is silence in the cage. The animal had died overnight! This gives the Rajah the chance to make an excellent showing of courage before the white-faced and bright-eyed Tiger Lady.This yarn moves with celerity and Mr. Menjou gives a splendid portrayal of humility and arrogance. Evelyn Brent is imperious and charming as the Tiger Lady.Hobart Henley's direction is excellent, the scenes in the restaurant being alive with imagination.

That vow will be tested quickly, Mr. Clinton said, and American and British forces that nearly struck Iraq on Saturday remain poised to act.   A1    Even before the Security Council resolved to give Iraq a chance to prove that it really intended to resume cooperation with arms inspectors, some familiar code words for trouble were in the air.

A11    Indonesian Military Scrutinized  The unrest in Indonesia subsided, but not before some military officers on duty to keep order on Saturday said they felt uncomfortable exerting their authority during the recent protests. Indonesians, diplomats and other analysts are perplexed as to why the military acted as harshly as it did, shooting and killing six demonstrators who had made no real effort to break through its lines.

Of particular concern are the accusations of sexual assaults committed by crew members. An examination of such cases on ships operated by the largest cruise lines found a pattern of coverups.

Large swaths of the city will experience a much closer connection with garbage, both through transfer stations, where waste is loaded for shipment out of state, and the fleets of trucks traveling to them. Critics say that minority neighborhoods suffer unfairly.   B1       Costs of Police Inquiries  New York City has a big financial incentive to strengthen the independent agency that monitors and investigates accusations of police misconduct, with police brutality lawsuits costing the city $96.8 million over the last four years -- nearly 10 cents of every dollar that the city paid in 1997 in personal injury cases, according to a new report released by the New York Civil Liberties Union.

This is not an accident. This is a structural contradiction at the heart of Dayton. And it may soon become the foreign policy  issue in the U.S. election.         The very reason the Bosnia cease-fire holds so well is the very reason the political clauses are not being implemented. The cease-fire holds because each of the Bosnian factions is led by authoritarian-nationalist figures, who can give an order to halt the fighting and it will be obeyed right down the line. The reason the political clauses are not being implemented is because they threaten the power bases of many of these same leaders, who have an interest in  keeping Bosnia divided and the conflict defined in nationalist terms to insure their hold on power.

The unusually bold assault, which wounded six American soldiers, appeared to be the biggest against an American target since the Jan. 30 elections.   A9    Rumsfeld Blames Turkey  Defense Secretary Donald H.

The measure was signed quickly at the White House by President Bush.   A1    Many Americans are taking an active role in their own deaths, some with the help of their doctors and others through actions of their own that blur the definition of suicide. Experts say support for physician-assisted suicide, now considered morally acceptable by more than half of Americans, is likely to increase as baby boomers demand a say over their deaths.   A1    The White House said President Bush's dramatic early return from vacation was necessary to save the life of Terri Schiavo, but Republicans and religious figures said the move was also political: a powerful embrace of the ''culture of life'' issues of religious conservatives who helped him win the White House in 2004.

Mr. Angelich boasts a prodigious technique, but wields it with a poise uncommon in someone so young.

Halls had to be hired and tickets sold, and in that sense, music became a commodity. The marketing of music has taken many forms, and it is now facing new changes geared to the space age. At present, these changes are still in the planning stage and not yet altogether certain of realization, and the record companies have been extremely cautious, at best. But the principles these plans embody and the challenges they raise may prove crucial to music in the future.   To put these matters in perspective, consider the traditional patterns of musical life, which took shape in the last century when cities grew with the rise of industrialism, and concert hall, opera house, cabaret and cafe emerged as the chief means of merchandising music. Later, the distribution of music expanded dramatically through recordings and radio, which have made music ubiquitous in our time.   Even so, some kinds of music -notably classical and jazz - are still hard to come by in some localities. Commercial radio stations - with some exceptions - rely on the proven profitability of Top-40 programming.

She speaks English well and gives a competent performance as a Russian girl named Anya Sorin, who, after being the mistress of a scientist, becomes enamored of Paul Ossip, a young married man who is too weak to resist the lithe little flirt.It is when a priest braves being shot to tell a group of young people about Moses and the Ten Commandments and the crossing of the Red Sea by the Israelites that Mr. De Mille's scenes from his famous production are used. While they are being screened the voice of the priest is heard describing the happenings of the Old Testament. It is most effective, and the episodes from the old film are still extremely interesting","excerpt":"the Red Sea sequence being as compelling as it was when it was first beheld at the Criterion.The Russian drama is not especially well written, and the manner in which some of the players speak their lines fails to give one the necessary impression of a Russian atmosphere. It is, however, a great improvement over the original modern story in \\"The Ten Commandments.\\" Irving Pichel as Professor Marinoff, a Soviet scientist, does excellent work most of the time, with occasional lapses of overacting.Marinoff scoffs at the Ten Commandments, saying that Russia now has a new set of commandments. He urges the young comrades whom the priest has addressed to forget the \\"Commandments of death, and bear in your hearts the words of life, of the Communist Revolution.\\" Among some of the commandments he gives are:\\"I, the State, am the Lord thy God. Thou shalt not have the Gods of outworn creeds before me.\\"\\"Seven days shalt thou labor if the State demand it.\\"\\"Thou shalt not kill—save at the bidding: of the State.\\"\\"Honor the State. The State is they father and mother.\\"Thou can'st not covet thy neighbor's goods—they are thine as well as his.\\"\\"Covet thy neighbor's wife. She is free, if she chooses, to come to thee.\\"This surgeon then orders the priest to be taken to the Cheka headquarters to be shot.Although there is an emphatic attack against the Soviet pagan ideas, it is palliated somewhat in the end by the conduct of Marinoff. For after he has killed Anya and wounded Paul badly he refuses to permit Paul to Dear the blame for the death of Anya, asserting the police must take him and that so far as his work is concerned it will go on possibly through Paul, who has been his pupil.Marguerite Churchill's interpretation of Paul's young bride is excellent. It is a pathetic scene where she and Paul decide to get a divorce, which is obtained in a minute or so by the mere formality of signing a ticket. Gene Raymond is sincerity personified as Paul, but his voice is not particularly suited to the rôle.There are several worth while settings, some of which reveal the communistic cramped dwellings, and others of Marinoff's laboratory, of two or three bureaus, and the interior of a church as it looks in these days.

The Red Sox said they were very interested in Evans and planned to keep him around for the next two years, whether he liked it or not.

After five games decided in the closing seconds, four of them defeats, the Red Storm trounced Rutgers, 73-58, after leading by as many as 26 points with 3 minutes 33 seconds left.     Felipe Lopez was the leading scorer for St. John's with 21 points.    ''That probably was as good a job as we have had all season,'' St. John's Coach Fran Fraschilla said. ''We looked like a basketball team.''     What's ahead for the Red Storm? With a record of 11-12 over all and 6-9 in the Big East, St. John's has three regular-season games remaining: at Villanova on Wednesday, at home in Alumni Hall against Miami next Saturday and against Seton Hall at the Meadowlands on Feb. 26.     Then comes the Big East tournament at Madison Square Garden starting on March 5. Given the balance in the conference this season, perhaps even St. John's can win this event. That would probably be the only way it could qualify for the National Collegiate Athletic Association's 64-team tournament.     If that is stretching reality, then there are smaller goals for the Red Storm: a 14-12 regular-season record, or at least a 13-13 mark with a victory in the Big East tourney, would probably gain a National Invitation Tournament bid.    A winning record is an N.I.T. prerequisite, and, given today's performance, that may be attainable for this team.     ''St. John's did a good job and we did a bad job,'' said Bob Wenzel, the coach for Rutgers (11-11, 5-9).    The Scarlet Knights' field-goal percentage was .321. They were 9 for 28 from the floor and 1 for 7 from 3-point range.     The taller St. John's players picked off 29 defensive rebounds","excerpt":"the Red Storm's overall rebounding edge was 43 to 27.    Wenzel said, ''Missing shots allowed them to fast-break and to get the ball down low, especially to Lopez.''    Lopez, who had 24 points against Syracuse at the Garden on Wednesday, has had two straight solid games. More significantly, St. John's has won two in a row, after losing six straight.     Lopez said: ''We started running. That's our game, rebounding and running.''     Lopez was the rebounding leader with eight, and St. John's, for a change, could afford his seven turnovers, and its 23 turnovers as a team. The Red Storm shot 46 percent and made 24 of 33 free-throw attempts.     Charles Minlend, working hard as usual, scored 15 points. Zendon Hamilton added 10.    Rutgers's high scorer was point guard Geoff Billet, who had 13 points.    St. John's led at the half, 33-23, and the Red Storm's thunder continued through the final 20 minutes.     The St. John's game plan was to attack the Scarlet Knights' 2-3 zone defense. It worked.     Of the 7,496 fans at the Rutgers Athletic Center, Lopez said, ''We wanted to shut the crowd down in the first half, and we did.''     The two teams had met 17 days ago at the Garden and Rutgers made a 3-point shot at the buzzer to win, 49-47.    ''Today we did a better job with the zones,'' Fraschilla said. ''I thought the key was we took so few 3-pointers. We were able to attack their zone inside.''    St. John's tried two 3-pointers in the first half and 10 over all. The coach had something to worry about when Lopez, stopped by the 7-foot-1-inch, 255-pound Jamar Holcomb while driving for a dunk, crashed to the floor behind the end line. Although he landed on a photographer, that did not prevent an injury.     Lopez bit his tongue and lacerated it in the fall. He remained down for a couple of minutes, and then went to the bench for a longer period before returning. He played a total of 36 minutes.     ''Felipe bled on my new suit,'' Fraschilla said. ''But that's all right. His demeanor never changes. He's humble. And he's taken so much. He's a great kid. I love coaching him.''

His new paintings (eight small and six medium-size) describe in greater and more macabre detail than ever an irrational Bosch-like world of bizarre biological mutation and inter-species violence, while playing down the jewel-like transparent colors that were previously the artist's trademark.    In \\"Barnyard Scene,\\" a raccoon appears to be raping a rooster, while \\"Eastern Woodland Scene\\" features a raccoon with a duck's bill for a mouth, a bird claw for a paw and a worm appended to its bushy tail that is eating a multi-eyed fish.    Whereas Mr. Rockman's creatures used to waver between abstraction and representation, his new protagonists are conventionally realistic. The artist has relegated his painterly flourishes to the backgrounds, where crackling, scumbled surfaces conflate Color Field abstraction with primal ooze and decay and suggest that each canvas starts out as a kind of abstract tabula rasa. See, for example, the thick-thin layers of pinks, lavender and white that occupy the lower portion of \\"The Larder,\\" a painting whose bird-on-limb motif brings to mind the tropical paintings of the 19th-century Luminist Martin Johnson Heade. (Until, that is, you spot the lizard skewered on a giant thorn.)   These images are in many ways riveting: the eye devours their freaks and dramas, their colors and details as surely as Mr. Rockman's creatures devour one another. But the experience can also leave an aftertaste not unlike that brought on by watching a bad horror movie. Perhaps Mr. Rockman is becoming more and more the genuinely eccentric artist that he seems singularly equipped to be. Still, as with so much Neo-Romantic landscape painting to which his work tangentially relates, it frequently appears that age-old narrative and pictorial devices have been brought out, dusted off, recombined in dizzying complexities and presented as something new.    A final note: the exhibition is accompanied by a catalogue that contains one of the best essays of the season. Written by Douglas Blau, it is simply a lengthy index that might accompany a book about Mr. Rockman's work","excerpt":"the references cited run the absolute gamut of art, science, literature and popular culture, including, of course, horror movies. This fantastic effort, in both senses, is a fitting codicil to the paintings and also conjures the writer's eternal dream of doing the research without having to write the book.

Though Mr. Rivera's recounting of this conventional, perhaps autobiographical story contains no dramatic surprises, his writing is vigorous and honest.   The honesty can be found in the author's evenhanded portrayal of the Iglesia family - a Puerto Rican clan that migrated to Suffolk County in 1961 and whose members we meet in 1980. The hero, Javier, is a recent college graduate in political science who often finds his parents embarrassingly indistinguishable from the Puerto Rican ''fools'' he sees loitering on Eighth Avenue.

Maybe you can't buy a greeting card to thank your mother for not aborting you, but now there's a hip-hop track expressing that very sentiment. Visit www.nickcannonmusic.com to hear ''Can I Live,'' which has a chorus by the winsome soul singer Anthony Hamilton, and to watch the video. (Beginning with protesters outside an abortion clinic, it stars Tatyana Ali as the pregnant protagonist.) ''I know the situation is personal,'' Mr. Cannon declares at the beginning, perhaps understating the case. He is no one's idea of a brilliant rhyme-spitter, but sometimes content trumps form, as when he rewinds to his very early years -- as a fetus -- to declare, ''Mommy, I don't like this clinic/Hopefully you'll make the right decision/And don't go through with the knife decision.'' There should be a special Grammy reserved for the first politician (on either side of the aisle) who finds a way to appropriate this strange but not unmoving song. And Mr. Cannon deserves recognition, too, for finding a truly startling way to express a rather simple thought: he's happy to be alive.

Juliet works with the producer Stuart Price (aka Jacques Lu Cont), who's on a roll. (He's the guy who turned ''Mr. Brightside,'' by the Killers, into a suave robo-pop track.) Impatient Juliet fans can tide themselves over with her more ominous second single, ''Ride the Pain,'' which sounds best in Mr. Price's buzzy ''Thin White Duke'' mix.    Toby Keith      To promote his charming new album, ''Honkytonk University'' (Dreamworks Nashville), this roguish country star released a single and a video of one of the album's dullest songs, ''Honkytonk U.'' But the follow-up, ''As Good as I Once Was,'' is up to his usual high standards, with a story line that's as memorable as the tune, and a video that's even better. The lyrics describe an aging barfly who greets both friendly women and unfriendly men with the same swaggering credo: ''I ain't as good as I once was/But I'm as good once as I ever was.'' There's a whisper of self-deprecation in this song, and the video turns that whisper into a roar. Suffice it to say that he sings the final chorus from the back of an ambulance, and it looks as if his every orifice is swollen or bloody or both.    Timbaland      After a relatively quiet period, this brilliant producer has a couple of great tracks circulating on hip-hop mixtapes. ''Get Down'' (also known as ''Get to Poppin'''), an eerie club track by the Alabama rapper Rich Boy, is built around a warped, unplaceable sample of a woman's voice atop some slow-motion drums and a simple hand-clap","excerpt":"the remix, featuring the surging Cuban-American rapper Pitbull, is even better. Then there's ''Rollin','' by Timbaland's promising new protégé John Doe, who delivers half-sung verses while his producer focuses on melody instead of rhythm. It's a mournful mini-symphony, with interwoven synthesizer lines punctuated by interjections from a professional interjector: Lil Jon.    Phosphorescent      That's the name used by the singer-songwriter Matthew Houck, who is, at the very least, responsible for one of the year's best song titles: ''I Am a Full Grown Man (I Will Lay in the Grass All Day).'' That's track five from ''Aw Come Aw Wry'' (Misra), his second album, which also happens to be a minor masterpiece. Like lots of other indie-rock singers, he uses a beaten-down voice to deliver well-chosen words surrounded by country-tinged arrangements that slouch toward grandeur. And ''Joe Tex, These Taming Blues'' begins with a couplet so outrageously whiny that Mr. Houck almost seems to be chuckling at his hapless hero: ''Is it ever gonna not be so hard to see you around?/Am I really really really really gonna have to really gonna have to really have to leave town?'' This CD hasn't received much attention since its release on June 7; fans of Bonnie ''Prince'' Billy and Bright Eyes might want to set about changing that.    Missy Elliott      Some singles rely on charm. But not ''Lose Control,'' the current club-centric single from Ms. Elliott. The track is based on an old proto-techno record by Cybotron, and Ms. Elliott enlisted the newly minted electro-pop star Ciara to do some of her delicious sing-rapping, and she also invited the big-voiced (and not, by the way, small-bodied) hypeman Fatman Scoop, who never stops barking commands: this is a brute-force assault. The video, directed by her frequent collaborator Dave Meyers, is as heavy-handed -- and, immediately, as irresistible -- as the track. There's nonstop dancing, of course, but the scenes hint unexpectedly at minstrelsy (a row of dark-skinned, white-gloved mimers) and slavery; there's an unsettling suggestion that freeing your mind isn't always the same as freeing that other thing.

However, the latter title does have a certain lofty ring, which befits the exotic variety and the air of majesty of the whole thing.For there is something stunningly regal about this composite photograph of the tour of the Commonwealth nations the Queen and her handsome consort made for the obvious purpose of binding the traditional Commonwealth ties. And while much of it is repetitious of formal greetings and formal functions here and there, it views a great variety of colorful places and gives a sense of deep regard for the fine young Queen.Already we have had two pictures covering stages of the round-the-world trip. \\"A Queen's Royal Tour,\\" which opened in March, followed the travels of the couple from the Fiji Islands through New Zealand, and \\"The Queen in Australia,\\" which opened just the other day and is showing at the Trans-Lux Sixtieth Street, covers the two months they spent in that vast realm.It is notable that the best parts of the picture being shown in CinemaScope at the Globe are those that review the subsequent stages of the royal tour. Both the content and the color of the footage through the Australian stage incline to be pale and pedestrian, for all the beauty of the scenery beheld and the evident enthusiasm of the huge crowds along the way.But with the arrival of the party in Ceylon the color is immensely improved and the atmosphere gathers warmth and brilliance. The ceremony of greeting in the country's Independence Hall makes a dazzling display of ceremonial, and the scenes of elephants and dancers on parade and of sari-robed women in the tea fields are full of exotic charm.

For now, the announcement by the candidate, Jon Grunseth, leaves only Gov. Rudy Perpich, a Democrat who is seeking a fourth term, on the Nov. 6 ballot.   A Republican Party official, Barb Sykora, said on KSTP television that it normally took five days to convene the party's central committee, which must choose any replacement for Mr. Grunseth. The deadline for filing is Friday afternoon.   State Auditor Arne Carlson, the runner-up in the Republican primary for governor in September, re-entered the race as a write-in candidate last week.     The report, in the Sunday issue of the Star Tribune, follows allegations that Mr. Grunseth, a 44-year-old business executive, had tried to get two teen-age girls to swim nude with him nine years ago. Mr. Grunseth denied the allegations, maintaining that they were manufactured by Mr. Perpich's campaign.

Ms. Taylor told the newspaper that she met Mr. Grunseth at a party at his home in 1979, when he was married to his first wife, and that their affair began in 1980 and continued intermittently. She said they last had sex together in July 1989, when she met Mr. Grunseth in Washington.   Mr. Grunseth has acknowledged what he calls \\"wild years\\" in the late 1970's and early 1980's.

This time it is in the Italian drama, \\"The Most Wonderful Moment\\" (II Momento Piú Bello), which came to the Fifty-fifth Street Play-house on Saturday.Like this comparatively new branch of obstetrics, \\"The Most Wonderful Moment\\" is clinically pure, informative, edifying and, on occasion, tenderly dramatic. But it is drama that is shot through with romantic clichés that have plagued movie men in white long before Dr. Kildare reached high school.A viewer is reminded fairly often that Luciano Emmer, the youthful but experienced director known here for excellent documentaries and a few noteworthy features, appears to be struggling more with his story line than with the scientific aspects of his film. These constitute, far and away, its best features.His scenarists, on the other hand, have come up with a tale of a young, dedicated medico, a stanch champion of natural childbirth, who is deeply in love with a beautiful nurse, an affair they keep secret until they discover their union is to be blessed by a little stranger.Our harassed hero, sincere beyond a doubt, nevertheless, feels that marriage will put a damper on his professional prospects. Our heroine, who is just as sincere, leaves him to his prospects and joins forces with her friend, a lady obstetrician, to practice natural childbirth and await the birth of her child.There are, of course, a few subplots reminiscent of a variety of other hospital dramas, including the one about the physician who marries a rich girl and sets up a fashionable practice","excerpt":"the resident who finally leaves the trying business to begin anew as a general practitioner in the country and several references to the underpaid, overworked hospital staff who are chained to their tasks because of fear of the economic hurdles facing them in starting practices of their own.In refreshing contrast to the standard quality of the fictions of this offering are what obviously are its factual facets. Signor Emmer took his cameras into the maternity ward of Rome's San Camillo Hospital back in December, 1956, and as a result his film bristles with authenticity.The immaculate operating rooms, the wards and the corridors and personnel are given documentary looks and sounds. Squalling infants just a few days old, pregnant women, anxious fathers and seriously professional medical men, who actually \\"played\\" themselves, add the ring of truth to the proceedings. And, according to a report from Rome, an actual mother, pregnant at the time, was hired to portray herself in training for natural childbirth and to participate in the delivery itself.Thus, the language and mechanics of psychoprophy-laxis is given subdued but eminently effective illustration. Breathing exercises, physical training and lectures explaining the physiology of parturition add explanatory color to the short sequence showing a painless birth, which is done vividly but in respectful good taste.Giovanna Ralli does well in the role of the realistic but smitten nurse, who practices what she preaches and whose love is vindicated in marriage and motherhood. Marcello Mastroianni is properly intense, as her doctor-lover, while Marisa Merlini, as her obstetrician-friend, heads a competent supporting cast. The English subtitles translate the dialogue literally and point up the fact that the film's most wonderful moments are scientific and not romantic.

All rooms have a private plunge pool, and there’s a staff of 40 butlers to take care of your needs.

The balance will repay a loan from his private company, RM Holdings.   The offer, which does not include an interest in Mr. Maxwell's recent purchase of The Daily News in New York, was in line with the predictions that stock analysts made when Mr. Maxwell announced plans for the offering on April 17.  Options Offered     The accompanying financial statements put a value of $:625 million, or $1.07 billion, on the company's main newspapers, including the The Daily Mirror and The Daily Record. Mr. Maxwell will remain in overall control with 51 percent, or more than 204.4 million of the shares, through privately owned holding companies.    Options on an additional 64,000 shares each will be offered to Mr. Maxwell's son Ian, who is the company's deputy chairman, and seven other directors at no less than today's offering price.    Mr. Maxwell said it was obvious that there would be a premium on the share price when public trading begins on May 21.    Of the 196.4 million ordinary shares to be publicly offered, 114 million are being offered through Samuel Montagu & Company to British investors who apply by 10 A.M. on May 9 for a minimum of 200 shares. Another 78.5 million will be offered by Salomon Brothers International Ltd. to institutional investors abroad, according to a prospectus issued today. The remainder will be offered to employees.    The prospectus put 1990 after-tax profits for the group at $:54 million. The group's basic holdings are five large British tabloid newspapers whose sales and circulations have declined so far this year. Share Earnings were put at 18.2 pence, (31 cents) a share, or 12.5 pence (21 cents) a share after taxes, for a price-earnings ratio of 10.    Mr. Maxwell's prospectus did not disclose his salary. It placed the circulation of The Daily News at 700,000, down considerably from the pre-strike level before he acquired it from the Tribune Company of Chicago.  Smaller Work Force     The prospectus also said Mr. Maxwell had reduced the group's full-time labor force at his printing and newspaper plants here to an average of 3,726 in 1990 from an average of 7,235 in 1985.    The main reason behind the public offering in the newspaper group is to reduce debt. That was also what prompted the Maxwell Communication Corporation, which is also traded publicly, to sell Pergamon Press in March to Elsevier N.V. of the Netherlands.    The financial statement issued with the prospectus today showed total indebtedness of the Mirror Group as of April 12, 1991, at $:583.7 million, of which $:187.8 million is in lease commitments","excerpt":"the rest is in bank loans and overdrafts.

Whether writing naturalistically about village life in England, or fantastically about the destinies of elves, Sylvia Townsend Warner (who wrote in a wide variety of genres, including poetry) works her curious trick of showing how one thing does indeed lead to another, often in the most alarming way. ''Some Effects of a Hat'' is typical: an American tourist leaves his homburg behind in a chance encounter with an unmarried, unpopular woman living in Devonshire. Expecting him to come back for it and unwilling to let the expensive hat sink into the oblivion of daily neglect like ''the inexplicable key on the bathroom window sill, the dog-eared packet of wallflower seed behind the parlour clock,'' the woman keeps it spruced and ready on the table near her front door. Her hostile neighbors get suspicious of a man's hat (''It's been moved a good inch to the right since I saw it last Tuesday''), and she is eventually driven out of town, only to end up in Derbyshire and a new life.

Brezhnev's visit to the United States. The films are scheduled for further showings in this country, possibly for commercial distribution. Two have been dubbed into English","excerpt":"the rest, mercifully, are subtitled.They are presented as representing a cross section of recent Soviet film making. I suspect they do represent certain aspects of popularly accepable Russian film making, and for people whose idea of the Soviet cinema has been formed by \\"Potemkin,\\" \\"Alexander Nevsky,\\" \\"The Lady With the Little Dog\\" or even \\"Ballad of a Soldier,\\" the new movies may come as a discouraging surprise.Consider the story of Aleksei Sakharov's \\"In His Right Place\\": Semyon, a young engineer, gets himself elected chairman of his collective farm. He believes in much work and no wasted time. He does not believe in smoking, drinking or miniskirts—and neither does the film. He proposes many changes with a view to modernizing the collective. At first the older people oppose him, but eventually they see the light, and the young chairman succeeds.Or consider the story of Oleg Bondaryev's \\"The Stepmother\\": When Pavel, who maintains and operates machinery on a collective farm, learns that a woman he was once in love with has died—leaving behind a little girl who is, in fact, his daughter—his good wife, Shura, agrees to take the child in and to become her stepmother. At first the child is mistrustful and withdrawn; but eventually Shura's goodness and maternal warmth win her over, and the stepmother succeeds.I've left out a lot. The films are full (but not too full) of humanizing and individualizing details. Some of the performances—such as Tatyana Doronina's as the plump, good-natured, perpetually flustered, slightly dimwitted stepmother—are very expert. But despite the details and the performances, these are films of an almost numbing simplicity. They are exactly the \\"realism\\" that might do for edification in some ideally placated society. And compared with other East European cinemas—compared with what we have seen over the last few years, say, from Yugoslavia, from Hungary, even from Bulgaria—they are film making at a kindergarten level of cultural awareness and dramatic sophistication.Two of the Russian movies are escapist entertainment. Vladimir Motyl's \\"White Sun of the Desert\\" is a picaresque adventure, involving the heroic exploits of a Red Army soldier in the insufficiently socialized wilds of Turkestan. Leonid Gaidai's \\"Ivan Vassilyevich Changes His Profession\\" suggests what might happen if, by means of a time machine, Ivan the Terrible were suddenly to find himself in 20th-century Moscow, while two 20th-century Muscovites were, taking Ivan's place in medieval Russia.With the kind of madcap comedy idea that withers the imagination even before it hits the screen, \\"Ivan Vassilyevich\\" is of interest mainly for its director's unflagging devotion to the assumption that rapid-motion photography is always funny, for the graffiti that show up on Moscow apartment-building walls (extensive, but still preaerosol-spray-can) and for the intimations of luxury in middle-class urban life. Convertibles, cameras, tape recorders, black-market transistors—the film is a small-scale homage to conspicuous consumption.The best of the films also ostensibly the most official—a long semidocumentary called \\"The Taming of Fire.\\" Written and directed by Edward Smirnov and Miss Doronina (the stepmother is also a scenarist), it concerns a pioneering space scientist who suffers a heart attack and then, hovering between life and death, immediately has a 2-hour-and-20-minute flashback covering the entire history of Soviet rocket development from the beginnings to the present.There are interesting sidelights, such as the shooting down of Francis Gary Powers's U-2 spy plane in 1960, or the exploding of a Soviet nuclear bomb (justified on the grounds, more or less, that the Americans already have it, and the only language those people understand is force). But the movie really comes alive with its rocketry and with its exotic and marvelously theatrical—and, I assume, authentic—space hardware.Unfortunately the dialogue is English-dubbed, and, through the universal alchemy of dubbing studios, it has been transformed into 50 per cent non sequiturs. But from what I can make out, \\"The Taming of Fire\\" is not wholly enamored of state science or hard work or success. It even sees its great scientist (quite well played by Kirill Lavrov) as something of a dedicated monster and all of Moscow's honors as a rather paltry substitute for life. In the context of Soviet cinema week, this seems like the stirring of some real air to breathe.

In part, my discomfort grew from memories of wretched hotel food, which invariably made me break out in boils, and the rather hostile attitude of Bulgarian officials functioning under a mandated policy of anti-Americanism. Primarily it was based on the fact that the People's Republic had issued a ukase barring me from the country for life. Twice.   The reason given for the action was a joke I had used in an article to illustrate the attitudes of Rumania toward neighboring states. The joke took a cut at Todor Zhivkov, then Bulgaria's Prime Minister. It appeared first in 1965 in the daily paper, prompting the initial ukase. When it appeared a second time, in this magazine, the Bulgarians reiterated the lifetime ban. I had not tested the ban until now, and although I had no trouble getting a visa, I was a bit hesitant.   Not surprisingly, I found many changes in Bulgaria, from the easy availability of food, clothing and housing to the smooth handling of foreign correspondents - for a fee - by a special state agency.

When Italian Dishes Defy Expectations"},{"year":"1995","title":"I WAS never a believer in Ireland. The blarney about peat bogs, misty mountains and smiling Irish eyes did not convince. But during a recent visit, I realized that this country has a much more specific appeal than cliches about the Emerald Isle. Its landscapes, villages and coastlines have somehow avoided the corrosive ugliness brought on by modern civilization, and in particular by tourism. Nowhere is this more true than in West Cork. Its difficulty of access and uncertainty of weather have preserved its beauty in a magical time warp.   Not that the area is maintained like America's \\"historic\\" towns -- in aspic, with costumes. Drive from Bantry to Skibbereen, the two towns that anchor the west-east borders of this part of County Cork, and you will see scrubby fields dotted with sheep and goats, donkey carts carrying families to market, crumbling Georgian houses, ruined barns, and the usual flotsam and jetsam of a small rural area trying to make ends meet.   But thanks to generous subsidies from the European Union (Ireland, like Greece and Portugal, other less economically successful nations, has been a major beneficiary of this otherwise contentious alliance), life is on an upswing in West Cork. The stucco facades of the village houses are freshly painted in their traditional bright purple, pink, yellow and blue, colors you would expect to see around the Mediterranean or Caribbean rather than the moody Atlantic. The food shops are filled with a wide range of fresh produce, and the coves are punctuated with fancy sailing yachts as well as thriving fishing boats. An occasional Mercedes or BMW glides through town","excerpt":"the restaurants are crowded. West Cork has become a mecca for artists and artisans, and the West Cork Arts Center in Skibbereen is a showcase for local talent.   Enhancing this sense of well-being is one of nature's many gifts to the region. Although roughly on the latitude of Goose Bay, Labrador, West Cork is caressed by the warm air of the Gulf Stream throughout the year. It rarely snows here and rains often, causing the gardens to flourish with unseemly abandon. Semitropical plants such as palms, calla lilies, rosemary and abutilon jockey for position along the country roads, with wild fuchsia tumbling down the hedges in a rosy cascade, causing as much distraction to the unwary motorist as the flock of sheep moseying its way home after a day's grazing. This priceless quirk of climate, combined with the fickle northern light, make the region as affecting visually as the landscapes of Corot. It is not surprising that a few shrewd seekers after paradise have settled here, including such movie people as Jeremy Irons and David Puttnam, whose houses eye each other warily across Roaring Water Bay.   As one drives southwest from Cork airport, the small town of Rosscarbery is the first landmark of the West Cork region. A nearby site of druidic standing stones at Drombeg, a miniature Stonehenge, indicates that an ancient population once lived here. The road continues on into Glandore, the Cannes of West Cork. Charmingly situated on a cliff overlooking the harbor, Glandore's pubs and color-washed houses exude a serene glow in the soft Irish light. Sitting with a pint at the Glandore Inn, with a view of the church to our right, and in front of us running down to the water a public garden planted with lavender, petunias, salvia and flowering shrubs, my friend and I could understand why the Irish have always had a season ticket to Parnassus. Glandore is on one side of a long fjord, and facing it on the other side is a town called Union Hall (named for the Act of Union between Britain and Ireland in 1801), less glamorous than Glandore, more a serious fishing harbor. It is worth driving over the fjord on the one-lane bridge from one town to the other. We enjoyed a little detour north to Leap (pronounced lepp), where the water winds gently between small mountains like a child of the Rhine.   Skibbereen, like its name, is a cheerful Irish jig of a place and the heart of West Cork, with more bright-painted houses, bustling streets, and several antique and pottery shops. Six miles south of Skibbereen is the village of Casletownshend, which my companion had visited as a schoolboy 35 years earlier. Nothing had changed. Like many villages in Cornwall, England, it slopes steeply down to the sea. Castletownshend was given to the Townshend family by Charles II in the late 17th century, and one wall of the Episcopal Church of St. Barrahane's has an inscription that invites competition with the Lord Himself in its detailing of the saintliness of this powerful Protestant family. Castletownshend is also famous as the home of Edith Somerville and her cousin Violet Martin, the two women who chronicled the hilarious adventures of \\"The Irish R.M.\\" (an Englishman who served as resident magistrate) in their turn-of-the-century novels under the gender-free names Somerville and Ross. After visiting here on an unusually hot day, we drove to a sandy cove off the road between Castletownshend and Tregumna, where we swam (the water was Maine-cold) and explored the excellent climbing rocks.   A few minutes south of Skibbereen on Lake Abisdealy is one of the more unusual gardens to find in this undeveloped spot. The Liss Ard project is the brainchild of Claudia and Veith Meister-Turske (she is Swiss, he is German), who moved here a few years ago. Claudia told us of their New Age dream of creating a public wildlife garden, with park land, waterfalls, hills, sounds of water, arboretums and three sculptured \\"experiences\\" (the Crater, the Pyramid and the Sky Garden), designed by the California artist James Turrell and not yet completed. Local observers have remarked that this part of Ireland is already in effect a public park, with waterfalls, hills, wildlife and so forth, so why make the tremendous effort of time and money (they planted 10,000 trees and shrubs in six weeks) in an attempt to recreate what is already there? Bizarre in conception (Ireland was the only place in western Europe where the couple could acquire enough land) and wildly difficult to pull off, the Liss Ard Experience is at the moment a garden in progress.   Four miles southwest of Skibbereen is Lough (pronounced Loch, as in Loch Lomond) Hyne, the only inland sea lake in northern Europe. Surrounded by spectacular undulating hills, this lake is a marine biologist's playpen, owing to the unusual organisms that haunt its salty waters. (We found we would need scuba equipment, however, to share in the fun.) Among its curiosities is an asymmetrical tidal cycle; it takes four hours to rise and eight and a half to fall. A short hop from Lough Hyne is Baltimore, another ravishing coastal town, eight miles from Skibbereen. Baltimore, with picturesque cottages, and hanging baskets of fuchsia, geraniums and daisies ornamenting its narrow streets, is the home of a French sailing school, thus ensuring a wonderful anomaly: authentic French cooking in the heart of a remote Irish fishing village.   On the road from Skibbereen to Baltimore are Creagh (pronounced kree) Gardens, created by Gwendoline and Peter Harold-Barry earlier this century on the grounds of their Georgian house, and now kept up by their heirs. The gardens would have pleased the great English 18th-century garden designer Capability Brown, whose penchant for \\"natural\\" landscapes is faithfully reproduced here. Reflecting the wild beauty of the estuary on which they are situated, the extensive gardens rise, Nereid-like, from the water toward the more formal (and less successful) plantings close to the house.   From Baltimore to Bantry we caught other breathtaking views, in particular around the little hill town of Ballydehob, with its 12-arch viaduct overlooking Roaring Water Bay, and on down to Mizen Head and Fastnet Rock. As a child in England I used to hear on the radio daily weather forecasts from Fastnet, and imagined \\"Fastnet\\" as some mysterious web of divination. How thrilled I was finally to find its source, the Fastnet Lighthouse, which has been giving its soulful warnings to ships navigating the stormy Atlantic since the middle of the 19th century.   Bantry, the final destination of our tour, cast a different kind of spell upon us. About 25 minutes by car from Skibbereen, the town sits on a hill above a huge deep-water bay surrounded by a frieze of mountains, rocks and meadows. Dominating the town is Bantry House, which gazes down at this lush Irish panorama with a ramshackle serenity. One of Ireland's most famous stately homes, it combines the majesty of the best 18th-century architecture and landscaping with a spirited touch of Irish eccentricity.   Bantry House has witnessed much history. In December 1795, a French fleet of roughly 50 warships, carrying almost 15,000 French troops, sailed from Brest to Bantry to support the United Irish leader Wolfe Tone in his fight to free Ireland from British rule. The French got as far as Bere Island, at the mouth of Bantry Bay, before terrible storms and inefficient communications caused the fleet to turn back. In the Bantry House stableblock there is an exhibition about this failed invasion, with ships' models and printed extracts from Wolfe Tone's journals. Richard White, then owner of Bantry House and a prominent member of the Protestant Ascendancy (English who were given land grants in Ireland) was named Earl of Bantry for his loyalty to the crown during this uprising. His heirs have lived at the house ever since. The entrance is guarded by several poetical characters who speak Irish amongst themselves. The front hall is a dazzling space with large black and white tiles on the floor, leading to a staircase and various rooms, some on different levels, all oddly decorated with family furniture and paintings, including a portrait of the present owner blowing his own horn (literally). The main drawing room has vast floor-to-ceiling windows framed brilliantly in long panels of mirror, reflecting the views of the balustraded park and bay and mountains beyond.   The dining room has two gigantic built-in sideboards, the like of which I have never seen even in the grandest English stately homes. Through the long windows is a view of a columned portico and a sunken rose garden. The library has French doors that look out on the Italian garden, which consists of a central tree-encircled fountain with shells stuck onto its sides, and a stone staircase that rises up as far as the eye can see. In the library is a grand piano with the following notice on it: \\"If you are an experienced pianist and would like to play please tell us at the desk. Piano is tuned to concert pitch (440).\\"   Upstairs the atmosphere gets increasingly peculiar. In the East Bow Bedroom a closet door swings open to reveal a past owner's party dresses, a collection of Regency velvet jackets and silk chemises, all falling apart. The upstairs landing is strangely touching, with ancient peeling leather doors and dusty mementos. But the overall feeling of the house is not so much elegant decay as wild romanticism. What one remembers are the astonishing colors of the rooms -- a sensuous rose for the drawing room, an exuberant blue for the dining room -- and the huge mirrored windows that pay lyrical obeisance to the natural wonders of the land and seascape outside. Mostly unrestored both inside and out (although work is now proceeding with funds wheedled out of the Irish Government), Bantry House is a perfect metaphor for the bafflingly beautiful and original character of this part of Ireland. Making your way among the villages Getting There    The nearest airports are Cork (about an hour and a quarter from Skibbereen) and Shannon (over two and a half hours away). The main roads are fairly good, but when you travel between the small coastal villages, banish any thought of speed.  The dialing code for Ireland is 353. Prices are calculated at the rate of 1.6 Irish pounds to the dollar. Where to Stay    Rates are per person in a double room, and all include breakfast.    Liss Ard Lake Lodge, on a lake just outside Skibbereen, like its gardens, is an unexpected hotel to find in Ireland, in that it is designed in a kind of Zen minimalist style much favored in California. The 10 lakefront bedrooms are stunningly luxurious but austere, with all-white linens and furnishings, meditation lofts, video players, stereo equipment, spa bathrooms, and nothing else to detract from the natural beauty of the surroundings. Rates range from $80 to $192. Telephone 28-22365; fax 28-22839.  Ballylickey Manor House, overlooking Bantry Bay, 27-50071, fax 27-50124, is a splendid former shooting lodge with cottages, a pool and gardens, in a park with private trout and salmon fishing. Rates: from $72 to $131.  The 42-room West Cork Hotel on Ilen Road in Skibbereen, 28-21277, fax 28-22333, is well situated on the river at the edge of town, but it is less elegant and less comfortable than the two already mentioned. Rates: $48.  If you prefer a more \\"authentic\\" Irish experience, there are many bed-and-breakfasts throughout West Cork, and they are clean and cheap. The Skibbereen Tourist Office will book one for a fee of $1.60 locally and $3.20 for the rest of Ireland. (By the way, in Ireland, if you see a sign advertising a bedroom \\"ensuite\\" it means it comes with a private bathroom.) Where to Eat    Two musts for all visitors to West Cork (or any part of Ireland): Irish soda bread (basically flour, milk, baking soda and salt), which is sometimes light and fluffy, sometimes as rich and nutty as a carrot cake; and at least one half-pint of Guinness, a meal in itself, which tastes entirely different in its home country from the weakened stuff (even on draft) sent abroad.  Blair's Cove Restaurant, Durrus, seven miles south of Bantry, 27-61127, is in the stable of a restored Georgian house and serves (dinner only) good fish and shellfish, as do most of the restaurants and pubs in West Cork. Prices range from $16 to $40.  Liss Ard Lake Lodge has a restaurant suited to its owners' ecologically conscious vision, with food that is entirely free of cholesterol. They offer an impressive but light and healthy six-course dinner. An example: consomme, warm oysters with cucumber sauce, a vegetable tempura, fresh duck, sorbets and fruits flavored with anise and rosewater. All ingredients are fresh, pasta is home made, and the meticulously planned menu changes daily. A six-course dinner costs $53 a person.  Mary Ann's Restaurant, Castletownshend, 28-36146, has delicious crabmeat, scallops and mussels, and won the Egon Ronay award last year for the best Irish soda bread. Eat in the simple outside cafe if weather permits. Prices start at around 8 Irish pounds a person. Five-course dinner: $32.  The Rectory, Glandore, is in a Georgian country house, with lovely views over the harbor. Local produce is available daily. Dinner ranges from $32 to $48.  Chez Youen, on the quai in Baltimore, is a genuine French bistro with French chefs cooking French food. After a diet of crabmeat salads, this is the place for a change of pace. It even promises to have fresh lobster all year round (not Maine lobster, needless to say; what Americans would probably call crayfish). Prices range from $20 for lunch to $50 for dinner.  Many restaurants and pubs offer traditional Irish music on weekends.

Who really builds libraries anymore in the belief that they will be the symbolic anchors of towns, or campuses, or urban neighborhoods? These days a library is lucky if it can get enough money to buy books.     But if it seems naive to say that architecture can still matter in the realm of housing books -- that it can actually enrich the interaction between people and books, and even go so far as to strengthen the whole role of books in our culture -- a pair of newly finished libraries give hope. Outwardly, the two could not be more different. One is a brand-new building, far from the city, which has been built as the architectural centerpiece of a magnificent New England prep-school campus.

While the Puritans sometimes executed their children in order to teach obedience, we today - with somewhat the same mistaken approach to correction - send criminals to prison, only to teach them to become better criminals. As Robert Wideman - the younger brother of the Rhodes Scholar and award- winning novelist, John Edgar Wideman - says in ''Brothers and Keepers,'' ''By the time a dude gets out of here, most likely he's a stone criminal, or thinks he is. They got professors and Ph.D.'s in crime giving crime lessons in here. . . . You learn how to go for the big time.''    ''Brothers and Keepers'' is John Edgar Wideman's gripping account of the the events, social pressures and individual psychological responses that led his brother Robert to prison for murder and him to a middle-class life as a professor of English at the University of Wyoming in Laramie. By combining his own literary skill with the candor and vitality of his brother's street style, Mr. Wideman gives added power and dimension to this book about the contrary values and goals of two brothers.

BRIEFING"},{"year":"2007","title":"Re “A Semi-Nude Minor? In The Times?” (Dec. 16): While I can appreciate the fact that T magazine might not have been the most appropriate venue for this photo editorial, it is interesting to see how it has been perceived by so many people.It is also fascinating that people think that they have the right to judge so severely and with such vengeance.Perhaps these are the same people who would not enter an art museum unless the statues were covered in drapes. In Europe, the pictures in question would never elicit the least bit of controversy.There is nothing “minor” about Ali. She is an old soul who is an extremely intelligent, focused, disciplined, responsible young lady. She is as beautiful on the inside as she is on the outside. While she is a few months shy of her 18th birthday, she is more mature than most adults twice her age.She has had the good fortune to work with some of the world’s best-known photographers over the past two years, including Paolo Roversi. He is an icon in the fashion industry. While I am with Ali every step of the way, it is not up to me to choose which photographs are to be published. I do not have control over that decision-making process. That said, there is nothing remotely sexual or pornographic about the pictures in the T. In my eyes, they portray a sense of innocence and beauty.To those who have responded to your column by criticizing my daughter and me so vehemently: Please understand that I have my viewpoint, and you have yours. It is unacceptable for you to demand that we think exactly alike, and it is unconscionable that you feel the need to judge or attack while expressing your views. After all, we come from totally different backgrounds and perspectives and are each entitled to our opinions.Art and beauty are in the eye of the beholder. If you don’t like what you see, keep in mind that no one is forcing you to look. MaryAnn MichaelColleyville, Tex., Dec. 19, 2007 ● On the one hand, you’re right. I don’t read T. On the other hand, now that you bring it up, those photos of that 17-year-old model are not fit for a newspaper with general circulation.Exposing as much as possible of a minor’s body for commercial gain (but without getting arrested) is immoral, no matter how artful the photography.The Times can find some other way to sell its paper than exploiting even a willing minor whose parents care more about her career than about the character of our culture.J. Christy WarehamNewark, N.Y., Dec. 16, 2007 “ ● Jim Schachter, a deputy editor of The New York Times Magazine, justifies his decision to expose a youngster’s breast in a fashion spread by blurring the line separating commercial images from “art.”He acknowledges that “sexually charged” images sell products, so does he really suffer under the same illusion as the mother of the 17-year-old model, who found the layout to be “very artistic in nature”? Have we become so cynical that the currency of a young body can be peddled as “art” even in the most commercial of contexts?Rebecca ReichmannRancho Santa Fe, Calif., Dec. 17, 2007 ● I guess I am glad I never buy the Sunday Times. It’s not so much that I disapprove of the T magazine section (I’ve never seen it, I think), but that I would resent paying for it and disposing of it greenly.I do buy and read the daily Times every day, and subscribe to the Book Review. Much of the reason I don’t buy the Sunday Times is that there is so much in it I really have no interest in.Emily Ann SchmalzerBrentwood, N.H., Dec. 17, 2007 ● Ordinarily I automatically dump T in the T-rash without even opening it, along with other glossy ads for things I’ll never need or want. But your column prodded me to have a look online at the 17-year-old model posing semi-nude.What a disappointment! She’s no Lolita, just an underweight kid posing in a grown-up’s overpriced duds. And that barely perceptible bare breast was so badly out of focus that it registered zero on both the photographic and sexuality meters.The only astonishing thing about the photos was the revelation that a $3,890 Galliano taffeta coat could be worn, as the caption states, as a skirt.No, these photos didn’t register as pornographic nor tawdry — nor even edgy. Aaron EpsteinWashington, Dec. 16, 2007 ● Can fashion photographs be “art”? The word was used by many cited in your column.I have just viewed the photos of Ali Michael. I find an unmistakable reference to Degas’ sculpture of the 14-year-old dancer in the focused photo with a taffeta coat: the tied hair, the arms straight behind the back, the use of material in an original way, not to mention the insecurity of youth bravely confronting the hostilities of the world, including that of sexual exploitation.The great difference for these two models is, of course, exposure. Degas’ model posed in private","excerpt":"the resulting sculpture became the vehicle of expression.Ms. Michael is viewed by millions and is herself, to a far greater extent, the vehicle of expression. Her body has, in a sense, been designed to meet certain criteria of the modeling circuit, achieving that white, emaciated, vulnerable look.My concern for Ms. Michael is that the look of breakable china may go deeper than art or artifice.John DannAmherst, Mass., Dec. 17, 2007The writer is a painter and sculptor. ● Gee whiz, the Gray Lady is getting frisky. The soul-searching regarding this issue stands in stark (sorry) contrast to the Mapplethorpe uproar several years ago.At that time, Cincinnati decided that his work would shock and offend the good citizens of Cincinnati. The Times scolded the Queen City for its provincial prudery, in articles and editorials. It’s art, not porn, it proclaimed.Maybe yes, maybe no — either way, has The Times yet published even one of the “offending” photos? I haven’t seen one.Yes, of course, there are certain standards and unwritten laws (mostly involving advertising revenue) that must be considered — or are there?Give us a break. The Times is way ahead of the field in bowdlerizing words and images, while preaching open-mindedness to the benighted citizenry. Lionel LibsonCamden, Me., Dec. 16, 2007 ● The bright line T magazine needs to find is not is not one that “separates sexually charged images of men and women just short of 18 from art,” as Jim Schachter, a deputy editor of the Magazine says, it is the bright line that separates pornography from child pornography. If the model is, or looks, under-age, The Times should do itself and the world a favor. Hire a grown-up. Then readers can decide for themselves whether it is too nasty to have in the house, and editors can decide whether it is too nasty to have in The New York Times.Kathleen A. PoolPortland, Ore., Dec. 16, 2007 ● The photographs are neither sexy nor tawdry. The model is indeed showing a lot of skin, but she is much too skinny.Yale RichmondWashington, Dec. 17, 2007 ● You are a brave man. In today’s culture, you could be accused of censorship, prudery, proselytizing … a whole host of rocks could be thrown your way. And probably will be. I hope you can duck.The quest for material gain should never intrude on values. Keep explaining this to Jim Schachter, Bill Keller and all those at The Times who don’t seem to understand this.Bill FabrizioEast Atlantic Beach, N.Y., Dec. 17, 2007 ● Your column was much ado about nothing. After refreshing my memory with the pictures, I found the offending photo to be so indistinct as to be inoffensive and meaningless.The real issue was the exploitation of a minor in a semi-nude picture. This is the issue that you should have focused upon, not the poor-quality picture.Michael HermanNew York, Dec. 16, 2007 ● The Times risks losing its reputation by daring to see how far it can go in prurient appeal. If T magazine leads the way, can we expect its standards will show up in news sections? (News could serve up photos of the yearly naked run of students at Tufts, pictures of a bare breast at the Super Bowl halftime show.)If there are going to be double standards for sections of the paper, perhaps subscribers should be allowed to opt out of receiving T.S. E. SoderlindShort Hills, N.J., Dec. 16, 2007 ● I fear your column only stokes the fires of censorship by suggesting that art photography in The Times should be held to a different standard for good taste than that appearing in a specialist publication like V simply because The Times is sold to those who don’t seek or expect to find such images in their daily newspaper.This notion perpetuates America’s puritanical neurosis about the portrayal of the human form in any medium.While I found T’s photos (and most fashion or lifestyle photography today) to be silly, incomprehensible and pointless, I have no objection to it being offered up to those readers and advertisers willing to pay the big bucks to keep The Times and the industry for luxury products afloat.It would be far more objectionable for The Times to censor creative people who are exploring the edge of good taste to avoid offending a moralistic minority. Those people have nothing better to do than tell everyone else how to live their lives, and they won’t be satisfied no matter what you do.Whether the subject is fashion photography or news reportage, most thinking people can decide for themselves what content they want to see in their daily reading. P. Douglas FolkPhoenix, Dec. 16, 2007 ● The Holiday 2007 T magazine was very disturbing to me. After glancing through it and seeing the article with the young teenager, I was disconcerted by what I considered a step beyond art, pushing the images to a questionable level of good taste.Frankly, the entire issue left a stressed-out, overly commercial, lacking-in-substance impression. If I wished to read this type of magazine, I would buy it. Unfortunately, the past and present issue of T land in my waste basket often with but a glance.It is very revealing when the top editors have become inured to what that “edge” means to those of us who are not Seventh Avenue-hardened. The cult of the skinny anorexic models has gone too far. If you’ve ever known a young person who suffers this life-threatening state, it is neither attractive nor appealing.Ruth Mary PollackGuilford, Conn., Dec. 16, 2007 ● While neither tawdry or pornographic, as you say, the pictures you refer to probably startled quite a few readers, coming as they did in their Sunday morning paper.I do question the contention that content in T pushes limits that the regular paper does not. I recall seeing a photograph accompanying a review of the play “Lulu” in the Nov. 29 Arts pages. The picture was a highly sexualized young lady (probably not a teen, though, and I recognize that this likely changes the conversation), sitting with her legs spread around a seated man whose pants are around his ankles.I don’t point this out to criticize any of the pictures I’ve seen in The Times. I am far more inclined to take umbrage at a smug-looking Dick Cheney on Page 1 than any mildly erotic image within separate sections of the paper. I only wish to demonstrate that this sort of eroticism may be more prevalent in your paper than you might think. Ralph W. SiddallDes Moines, Dec. 16, 2007 ● My children are children no longer. I am more liberal than most, with a particularly strong perspective on censorship, but it is neither the parent nor the political animal in me that is concerned to see these pictures in a Times publication.No matter how seriously editors make decisions when skating the edge of child pornography, they are already over the edge in my book.The Times’s willingness to exploit this edge pushes me toward The Wall Street Journal. It’s easier to sort out that publication’s bias than to trust a company that would skim this edge. By sexualizing childhood for the sake of sales, The Times positions itself among a new batch of competitors.Longtime readers want The Times to move with the times, but this move reads as a sign that the Times may be morphing into something unrecognizable to this reader.Pamela MilesNew York, Dec. 16, 2007 ● I looked at the pictures on the Web site. Although, as Ali Michael’s mother said, she may be “very modest,” her garb and poses cross my line of what we used to call decency.My mother always demanded of me and my siblings that we do nothing in public that we would not do at home. That’s my line, and in my opinion, Ms. Michael crossed it.The Times should not have printed the pictures, regardless of the age of the model.Bill AbbottSaratoga, Calif., Dec. 17, 2007 ● That glossy magazine The Times throws at us 15 times a year is not part of the “culture.” That’s just an excuse to make more money for The Times.What happened to the wonderful magazine The Times used to give us at holiday time, showing New Yorkers and visitors the maps of the city and where each great holiday happening would be?Get back to basics and stop the stupid designer nonsense I throw in the garbage. And no more of these “culture” excuses.Estelle BrunoWest Sayville, N.Y., Dec. 16, 2007 ● Had I been a responsible editor asked to decide on those photographs, I would have nixed them. But not so much for the sexual suggestiveness as to avoid rewarding the physical child abuse of which they appear to be incontrovertible proof.As my wife instantly observed when I sought her opinion, that poor girl looks starved. The only visible curve on her is the profile of her breast. If she’s not anorexic or bulemic, then she is suffering from something else that also needs urgent medical attention.Isn’t the “fashion” industry belatedly recognizing this problem? Should The Times, or any newspaper, be part of the solution instead of the problem?Martin A. DyckmanWaynesville, N.C., Dec. 16, 2007 ● Those critics have too much time and too little do. Pornography is in the mind of the beholder. They must have filthy minds.Peter J. PeiranoRidgewood, N.J., Dec. 17, 2007●●Re “If It’s Fit to Blog, Is It Fit to Print?” (Dec. 9):It may have been the correct decision to keep from the printed version of The Times the quote from the book by Scott McClellan, the former White House press secretary, that suggested President Bush had lied to him since Mr. McClellan had already said to Larry King on CNN that he didn’t think Mr. Bush had knowingly pressed him to divulge false information.All the fuss over Mr. Bush seems to have eclipsed the fact that Mr. McClellan’s statement also included Vice President Dick Cheney, Andrew Card, Karl Rove and Scooter Libby.They were not similarly excused by Mr. McClellan on “Larry King Live.” How about mentioning that in the printed version of The New York Times? And how about a follow-up investigation of the fabulating four by Times reporters?James D. PoissonWakefield, R.I., Dec. 9, 2007 ● Your analysis of the excerpt from Scott McClellan’s not-yet-released book about the leak that led to Scooter Libby’s conviction raised compelling journalistic issues. But it glossed right over the substantive issue, arguing that the president may not have been one of the five who knew that Mr. McClellan was being asked to lie to the public and that therefore the leak story didn’t go to print.Wouldn’t the story of the president and his press secretary being lied to by Karl Rove, Scooter Libby, Vice President Dick Cheney and the president’s own chief of staff be front-page news?Mary E. FellowsPortland, Ore., Dec. 10, 2007●I have written in before to complain about The Times Magazine’s use of veryyoung-looking models. This may be the first actual breast, but spreadsfeaturing heavily made-up girls who look 12 or 14, sprawled in provocative,slutty poses are a standard feature of T ­ thumb through some back issues.I’m a Times subscriber in Tucson, and from here, obviously, the standardsof the New York fashion world (not to say the fashions themselves) arefairly incomprehensible. I take The Times to feel as if I know what’sreally going on, and despite some disappointments in the tone andindependence of the coverage, I love the paper and depend upon it. But thisold-hippie, staunchly anticensorship liberal is honestly shocked by theeditors’ lack of attention to the demi-child-porn in some of your fashionlayouts.If the Times lets fashion photographers, under-age models and their stagemothers decide what’s within the bounds of good taste, readers willcontinue to complain and editors will continue to have to explain howimages to delight pedophiles got into their newspaper.Renee DowningTucson, Dec. 16, 2007 Letters: The Readers Speak"},{"year":"1991","title":"Julia Scher  Pat Hearn Gallery 31 Wooster Street SoHo Through Dec. 21     Surveillance is the subject of Julia Scher's work, so much so that she has set up her own company to install video surveillance systems.

Each year Ms. Teirstein, the founder of Young Dancemakers, gives a group of students from New York high schools the opportunity to learn choreography by creating their own works","excerpt":"the results of this year's program are currently being performed around the city, including at a gala on Thursday at Stuyvesant High School in Manhattan. Here is Ms. Teirstein's almost foolproof plan, which, she said, has worked effectively for 10 seasons now.    GETTING IN -- In March, up to 80 students, referred by their teachers, audition. Those chosen return in June for an orientation (and to be photographed for marketing materials). At the same time, Ms. Teirstein holds a reception for parents. ''It gives them a heads-up on what they can expect for the summer,'' she says. ''It's a big responsibility. The kids are traveling out of town to perform.''    GETTING STARTED -- In early July, the students come to the dance studio for the first time as a company. After a few days of class in choreography, they develop their own ideas through free-form movement. Then they write a proposal based on an ''idea, or image, or something that has significance for them''; one student this year proposed a dance based on her experiences living in Sierra Leone during wartime. Once a proposal is approved, the student improvises movement and Ms. Teirstein videotapes the improv; the student has a night or so to review the tape. Then the actual dance making can start. ''They tell me what students they'd want for their piece,'' Ms. Teirstein says. ''There's 16 kids, so it's up to me to do the logistics. I have to make casts that will work. I have to make sure every person is in a certain number of dances, that we don't have any stars.''    GETTING IT ONSTAGE -- Ms. Teirstein describes the week from proposals to performances as the ''stretch.'' The students have class from 9 to 10:20 a.m. and rehearse until 3 p.m., with time out for lunch. William Catanzaro, who plays at the classes, helps the students choose their music and does sound design. With only eight rehearsals to get together about 16 pieces ranging from three to seven minutes, Ms. Teirstein said, things get crazy: ''I'm struggling with the time, trying to have enough time to help them develop their ideas. But these kids are so talented, their energy and cooperative spirit, these are teenagers that are really working together.''

That dissatisfaction has driven him to develop one of the more distinctive, and difficult, dance techniques around. In his new work, ''Map,'' commissioned by the Lincoln Center Festival (where it will have its world premiere on Tuesday night), Mr. Shen has codified his free-flowing technique, which he calls ''natural body development.'' Using the pelvis as the body's center, it focuses on innate momentum and simple transitions prompted by shifts of weight, changes in direction and the pull of gravity. ''Map,'' for 16 dancers, is divided into seven ''maps,'' or movement techniques, and takes its pulse from the multilayered rhythms of Steve Reich's score, ''The Desert Music.'' Usually one dancer introduces the theme of a map, which builds to a crescendo as the other dancers hook in","excerpt":"the results range from poetic to whimsical. Joseph Carman attended a recent rehearsal of ''Map'' by Mr. Shen's company, Shen Wei Dance Arts, and compiled this glossary of his technique as illustrated by the work's seven sections:    1. ROTATION MAP: Dancers, upright or on the floor, initiate movement from their ankles, knees, hips, shoulders, elbows, wrists and neck, as well as all articulations of their vertebrae. Looks like: Restless rag dolls.    2. BOUNCING MAP: Movement is generated from the hips, thrust forward, backward, sideways and in circles. The dancers bounce on their feet and jump into the air with quick rebounds. Arms flop. Looks like: Pee-wee Herman at a disco.    3. INTERNAL ISOLATION MAP: Using their breathing, the expressionless dancers create movement that moves from inside and out to the limbs, fully engaging the body. Looks like: Marionettes, manipulated by a highly caffeinated puppet master.    4. INTERNAL CIRCULAR MAP: The same as the Internal Isolation except that the body moves in smooth, continuous circles, just as Mr. Reich's rhythms loop back on themselves. Dancers execute phrases in musical canon. Looks like: Chinese court dancers painting the air, using their hands as brushes.    5. INTERNAL INDIVIDUAL MAP: The dancers, using the ''internal flow of their centers,'' spiral through space, alternating between suspension and propulsion. Looks like: A flock of sparrows flying in curlicue formations, then breaking off into individual flight patterns.    6. BOUNCING MAP 2: An expansion of the joint rotation and bouncing themes with the dancers in pairs. Looks like: Rag dolls coupling.    7. THE MAP: All of the maps -- internal, bouncing and rotation -- combined. Looks like: Everything that came before, performed all at once.

I found the literary equivalent of Sleeping Beauty, a nameless poem awakening from the ancient sheets in which it had lain undisturbed for centuries, a poem without a critical history.

Not since the 1930's has Realist art - the kind of painting, drawing and sculpture that appears to give us an accurate and unembellished account of what we see in the world around us - enjoyed such widespread exposure and esteem. Long regarded in avantgarde circles as the exclusive terrain of academics and old fogeys, on the one hand, or of political and commercial hacks, on the other, Realism has lately acquired a new prestige and a new visibility on the international art scene. Young artists now flock to its swelling ranks, which are already well-populated with defectors from abstraction and other well-established modes of modernist art, and museums and galleries are hastening to adjust to what amounts to a major turnabout in the course of contemporary taste.   Portents abound. Paintings that, 10 years ago, were regarded as vaguely demode, if not simply reactionary, have now acquired a certain chic, and the artists who painted them are hailed as the heroes of the new movement. Last month the magazine Art in America, which is always concerned with the latest thing, devoted an entire issue to the subject of Realism, and hardly a day now passes without some announcement of a new show, a new publication, or the organization of a conference or symposium on the subject.

SIGMUND FREUD observed in a letter to his friend Wilhelm Fliess, ''one always remains a child of his age even in what one deems one's very own.'' Freud's comment reveals that he had a much more realistic understanding of his place in history than the editors who omitted this passage along with many others when they produced the 1954 edition of his letters to Fliess under the title, ''The Origins of Psychoanalysis.'' Although they carried out their censorship in order to protect Freud's reputation, the creation of a larger-than-life image has proved to be a historical disservice. As Freud demonstrated in his psychoanalytic theories, censorship never works very well","excerpt":"the return of the repressed cannot be postponed indefinitely. The censorship of Freud's letters to Fliess, the Berlin physician who was his closest confidant from 1887 to 1900, demonstrates the truth of this principle in the writing of biography. By attempting to exercise tight control over Freud's historical image, his most loyal followers - the editors of ''Origins,'' Ernest Jones and those who have restricted access to his letters and manuscripts - have created a situation that could seriously damage his reputation in the public eye. The policy of allowing only a favored few access to the original documents has created the impression that there is something important to hide and has spawned a whole series of intensifying controversies as bits and pieces of evidence are released out of context by defectors from the guardian class.

Mr. Zvyagintsev creates a most moving tension between his massive, archetypical themes and the bristling specificity of his characters.
