Picturesque villages, medieval castles and major shrines on the Camino de Santiago, the pilgrim's road to Santiago de Compostela, grace this former kingdom (From 1234 to 1512 Navarre included part of southern France), and a recently developed network of private lodgings makes travel there downright cheap.\\n\\nMany of the family homes in Navarre offering bed and breakfast for under $15 a night, called casas rurales, are situated in unspoiled villages in the heart of the Pyrenees. To stimulate the regional economy, once dependent on timber, sheep and handicrafts, the Navarrese provincial government made loans to villagers willing to renovate their homes to accommodate tourists, mostly Spaniards, who come here for skiing, hiking, mountain climbing, cycling, fishing and hunting.\\n\\nSome casas rurales offer home-cooked meals, usually accompanied by one of Navarre's first-rate rosados, or sturdy red wines, for $7 to $10. The Navarrese are noteworthy cooks and many families grow their own vegetables and make sheep's milk cheese and cuajada (a delicious yogurtlike dessert). Even if meals aren't offered, most Pyrenean towns have simple restaurants serving such typical dishes as esparragos blancos (white asparagus), alubias (bean stew), pimientos rellenos (stuffed peppers), revueltos (eggs scrambled with mushrooms, green garlic shoots, shrimp, etc.), fresh trucha (trout), costillas de cordero (lamb chops) and cuajada. In sping and autumn, there are dishes with exceptional native mushrooms. I decided to begin my three-day trip to Navarre last spring with a nostalgic drive from Madrid to Burguete, a favorite place from previous trips. I would stay at a casa rural in Ochagavia, explore the Salazar Valley the next day, and end up in Roncal the next night.\\n\\nThe Camino de Santiago crosses the French border north of Burguete and winds through the hills above Roncesvalles, where Charlemagne's nephew Roland was immortalized in the epic poem \\"Chanson de Roland.\\" These mystical woods are imbued with the spirit of Roland and the Santiago de Compostela-bound pilgrims who passed this way. The restored 12th-century Roncesvalies monastery was once a proud pilgrim's hospice, known for its good food, real beds and its cobbler.\\n\\nBecause I wanted to reach Ochagavia before nightfall, I could spend just a few moments in Burguete -- stopping for coffee at a bar across the street from Hostal Burguete, which hasn't changed much since the 1920's, when Hemingway stayed there. In \\"The Sun Also Rises,\\" Jack Barnes and Bill Gorton went to Burguete to fish the Irati, a good hike east. The hostal's owners say the piano, which has \\"E. Hemingway\\" (sic) scratched under the lid, is the one in the novel.\\n\\nDriving on from Burguete through the rocky forests, I passed pretty, bucolic Garalda","excerpt":"Arrive, with its fine medieval bridge over the Irati, and Garayoa with a 13th-century Gothic church. High escarpments tower above the roads to the Abaurrea pass (3,320 feet), where I got a first glimpse of the snow-capped Pyrenean peaks, now suffused with a lovely peach glow from the setting sun. A series of hairpin turns would down a steep valley past Ezcaroz on the swift Salazar River just below Ochagavia, the valley's main town.\\n\\nOchagavia is a charming mountain-bound village of just under 800 inhabitants laid out along two sizable streams that form the Salazar at the town's southern outskirts. A passer-by showed me to Casa Osaba, a big stone house on a cobbled street. Gabriela Moso, the owner, led me up two flights to a plank-floored bedroom that had a big bed with warm coverlets, an armoire, and a night stand with the obligatory dim-bulbed lamp; down the hall was a new bathroom with plenty of hot water. In the family's modestly furnished second-floor dining room with a fireplace, was a herrada, a gleaming brass-and-steel, megaphone-shaped water vessel -- a unique piece of folk art. Gabriela invited one for dinner at 10 P.M.\\n\\nI took advantage of the remaining night to explore Ochagavia. Most of the houses are two-and three-story stone homes with white facades, tiled roofs, shuttered windows and flower-filled, wrought-iron balconies. The dates -- 1768, 1908 and 1926 -- on the arched stone portals above stout wooden doors, speak to their durability. The rough streets are hand-paved with river stones, requiring sturdy footwear. Across a stone bridge I found Pension Aunamendi, whose restaurant offers an inexpensive menu, but alas, no tapas at the bar. As I returned to Casa Osaba, wood smoke curling from the village's chimneys sharpened my hunger. I hoped Gabriela was a cook worthy of Navarre's reputation.\\n\\nIn the dining room I met Gabriel's family: her husband, daughter, grandson, and her son-in-law, who tends a large herd of sheep near Tudela. (Some proficiency in Spanish is necessary to get the most out of family dining situations such as this one.) In front of the cracking fire, Gabriela served a fine salad with white asparagus; garlicky green beans and potatoes; merluza rebozada (Hake in batter); fireplace-grilled pork chops; fresh cherries, and a good rosado.\\n\\nAfter dinner there was coffee and homemade pacharan, Navarre's sole berry-anise liqueur. After a chat about life in America, I went to bed, gave up reading in the dim light and slept soundly until morning. Breakfast was toast, butter and homemade plum jam; galletas, or snap cookies, and coffee. Bed and breakfast was about $12.\\n\\nFrom Ochagavia I followed the Salazar south through forests punctuated by striking cliffs and rock formation. Ancient stone houses, block-tower churches and cobbled streets give this valley's 15 villages a medieval air. Below Ezparza, a picturesque village with a Romanesque bridge, a 16th century church, and a trout farm, the road winds through spectacular gorges. Occasionally, a falcon soared overhead. Fields of poppies lined the road to Navascues, where I stopped to see the 12th-century Romanesque Santa Maria del Campo church, which stands in ancient solitude alongside the village cemetery southwest town. North of Navascues, the Roncal road curves up steep, craggy hills to Las Coronas pass (3,120 feet), where there is a splendid vista of the Roncal Valley.\\n\\nNine more miles of twisting roads brought me to Burgui, a dramatic town with a Romanesque bridge and a breathtaking canyon to its south. Along the river banks I saw almadias (Log rafts) used by almadieros, who re-enact the dangerous feats when, before trucking and a downriver dam was built, daring loggers rode rafts down the swolled river to the sawmills each spring. At Burgui the road joins the Pamplona-to-Roncal highway, following the Esca River through more precipitous gorges with waterfalls and suspension bridges linking trails over the river.\\n\\nAt Roncal's southern edge, on a hill overlooking the town, I found Casa Indiano, the charming two-story fieldstone home of Ana Maria Donazar, a grandmother who dotes, with equal amount of loving care, on her young grandson and her casa's rustic pinetimbered interior. The living quarters, including a kitchen with spectacular valley views, were on the second floor. Mrs. Donazar put me in a small room with a double bed, just across from a clean, modern bathroom.\\n\\nThe Roncal Valley is famous for its colorful folklore and its cheese. In early July the Roncalese dress in regiona costumes for a romeria (Pilgrimage cum picnic) at the hermitage of Idoya near Isaba. On July 13, Roncal Valley's seven mayors turn out in typical costumes for the \\"Tribute of the Three Cows\\" offered by their French neighbors from Bearn. This annual event dates from the Middle Ages and draws thousands to a site near the border.\\n\\nRoncal's renowned sheep's cheese, queso Roncal, reminiscent of Italian Parmesan, but milder and softer, was the first Spanish cheese granted a denominacion de origen (Like that for wine). Once an artisanal cheese, queso Roncal today is mostly made in a local factory.\\n\\nRocal's houses are of the same stout construction as Ochagaviea's but of more distinctive architecture. Like most towns here, its interior streets are paved with river stones. The home of the Roncalese tenor Julian Gayarre (1844 to 1890), the greatest Spanish opera singer of his time, is now a museum displaying mementos from his illustrious career. At Roncal's northern edge, the Esca runs by a trout farm acrosss from a park with picnic tables and fine views of the town's massive church.\\n\\nFor lunch, near Casa Indiano, I found Restaurante Begona, a small cafe overlooking the Esca. On the wall was a photograph of Roncal's trout fishing champion, a man wearing a huge Basque beret. When I asked for trout, Begona, who answers the noisy telephone, waits on tables and cooks, told me, \\"You have to call ahead.\\" I opted for salad, red bean and chorizo stew, revueltos con ajos y gambas (eggs with garlic shoots and shrimp), and queso Roncal. When I ordered a bottle of rosado, Begona handed me the corkscrew. Lunch was $10.\\n\\nNorth of Roncal is Isaba, an attractive village in a lush valley below the rugged gray-tone peaks that poke through the surrounding forests like giant teeth and culminate the Mesa de los Tres Reyes, Navarra's highest mountain at 7,984 feet. Saving a tour of Isaba for evening, I head north toward the mountains. On the way I saw fishmen working the Belagua, a stream criss-crossed by rustic stone bridges. On the plain below herds of sheep grazed and mares nursed wobbly-legged foals. Signs on farmhouses offered homemade cheeses.\\n\\nBeyond the plain the road climbed steeply for several miles to the heights of Belagua overlooking the valley. Halfway up the mountain at the Venta de Juan Pito, one can lunch on migas (Bread fried with oil and garlic) and grilled lamb chops by a big fireplace in the rustic dining room. The nearby Belagua ski refuge has spectacular cross-county and downhill trails, but no lifts. The road climbed through increasingly rugged terrain, where intensely blue wildflowers grew in striking juxtaposition to the rocks and snow. Finally, the road ran through a snow-lined pass with splendid views of France.\\n\\nThat evening I strolled through Isaba, admiring the streets and houses that seem to be made of the same rectangular stones, the flowerfestooned balconies and arched doorways. Since Roncal has few placed to eat, I dined in Isaba at Hostal Lola's popular restaurant, where peppers stuffed with bacalao, trout with ham, cuajada, a good rosado and coffee came to about $20. Back in Roncal I found a lively bar for a pacharan nightcap. A sign on th wall said \\"If bullfighting is art, cannibalism is gastronomy.\\"\\n\\nThe next morning at Casa Indiano Mrs. Donazar and her husband, with the \\"help\\" of their grandson, Xavier, gave me a breakfast of cafe con leche, pan tostado with homemade jam and galletas. I paid my bill (about $14 with breakfast) and reluctantly began the daylong ride out of these splendid mountains to Madrid.\\n\\nThe little boy and his grandmother waved goodbye from an upstairs window.

Just a disappointing, middling one, with a good cast headed by Michele Morgan, John Kerr, Mel Ferrer and Leif Erickson. These people are marking time in the grape country of southern France, where this Edwin H. Knopf production was photographed, under the direction of Jeffrey Hayden (a newcomer from television).Watching this film rather listlessly unfold, one might conclude that almost any plot would pale against such tough competition by nature itself, radiant in CinemaScope and color. As adapted by Michael Blankfort from an Ursula Keir novel, the symbolically titled story tells how two derelict brothers, one wanted for murder, briefly hide out amid the harvesting in a tiny community where each finds love, one fatally. And actually, nature forms an ideal backdrop for such a compact romantic quadrangle involving almost exactly the right number of bystanders.The attachments are certainly not what one would expect from the cast credits. Young Mr. Kerr, as the emotionally taut criminal, yearns for the more mature Mlle. Morgan, while her burly spouse, Leif Erickson (Mr. Kerr's old \\"Tea and Sympathy\\" foe) glowers. That beautiful child, Miss Angeli, heads straight for Mr. Ferrer, instead of his brother. And for credibility, for whatever reasons, the two lonely ladies have it all over the brothers.Unable to sidestep a script that remains pure, endless talk, some of it quite fanciful for the country, Mr. Hayden has simply had to frame the incidents thoughtfully, as the pace drags. Mr. Erickson, by the way, is excellent, as is that versatile actor, Theodore Bikel, playing a vineyard foreman.However, the beauty and sweep of the French countryside—of the sun-baked vineyard village nestling under purple mountains—is a constant joy to behold. David Raksin's pulsating musical score is most helpful. If only the same held true for the tempo and pitch of the proceedings!

The front-runner for 1993 Art Pet of the Year may not be as flashy, but it's at least as charming: a 2,000-year-old granite crocodile from Egypt. One of the latest acquisitions by the Metropolitan Museum of Art, it has been installed in a corner of the pool that surrounds the Temple of Dendur, as if floating on the water, waiting to chomp the wayward visitor. The sculpture was made around the same time as the temple, which was dedicated to two young warriors who traditionally are thought to have drowned in the Nile River and may have been devoured by the crocodiles that populated it. There's another connection between sculpture and architecture: in Ptolemaic and Roman Egypt, crocodiles were associated with Isis, to whom the temple is also dedicated.   The stone reptile has one pair of feet in the past and another in the future, stylistically speaking: the decorative patterns along its sides owe a debt to Pharoanic Egyptian art, while naturalistic touches like its bony spine, the furrows of flesh around its neck and its springy pose look forward to the realism of later Roman art. Sculptures of crocodiles were commonplace in ancient Egypt, but this one is exceptionally large and handsomely carved.

Jaffe, whose model good looks can be seen on the catalog's cover, where he lounges in a tweed jacket and turtleneck, helped define the cool neo-Modernist style of a certain late-1960's Long Island milieu. But his houses were more than fashionable settings for cocktail parties, creepy bachelors and dysfunctional postwar families. Stripped down and decorated with wood shingles, sunken living rooms and stone fireplaces, they blend vanity and romance in a way that was particular to that era, and they even exhibit occasional signs of a modest architectural talent. 25 Job's Lane, Southampton, N.Y., (631)283-2118.    If you prefer the more idyllic Yankee landscapes of an earlier America, visit the WINSLOW HOMER show at the National Gallery of Art in Washington through Feb. 20. It includes oil paintings and watercolors that range from solid, if subdued, masterworks like ''Hound and Hunter'' to the dying deer in ''A Good Shot, Adirondacks.''

The other day I turned left at the top of the steps in the METROPOLITAN MUSEUM, into the long hallway that usually funnels the tourists toward Impressionist paintings (it is temporarily shut at the end), and suddenly caught sight of a classic HENRI CARTIER-BRESSON photograph, his cubistic masterpiece shot from inside a bullring in Valencia, Spain, in 1933.    It's the one in which the arena's double-door is ajar. The number 7, within a bull's-eye painted across the doors, is split into half-circles. A chubby, mustached man in a hat, with spectacles, chomping absently on a stogie, peers through a rectangular slot in the door, off to the side. Beyond the open doors, a second, thin man, wearing the same hat (they must be attendants at the arena), stands in the middle distance, turning from the camera toward a pair of matching slots in the doorway behind him.    Cartier-Bresson's pictures are ingenious Chinese boxes: humane miracles of rhyming form and surreal happenstance that beg to be unpacked. The two round lenses of the man's glasses -- one of his lenses opaque from the sun, the other transparent -- uncannily echo the half circles of the bull's-eye and also echo the two slots in the rear, which are like eyes in the door. The man's glance, three-quarters to the right, is reversed by the man behind him, who becomes his virtual mirror image.    Depth collapses. Space explodes into a jigsaw pattern, and Cartier-Bresson demonstrates, as only he so rigorously and elegantly can, that the world is an astonishing and mysterious sight if we are alert enough to notice. All it takes, his pictures remind us, is that we stop and look. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212)535-7710.

The first, called ''Climaxed,'' is a floating fireball hanging in midair that continually explodes. The second originated last fall, when Mr. Oursler was asked by the MUSÉE D'ORSAY to choose something in its collection and create a work of art in response to it. The result is ''STUDIO: SEVEN MONTHS OF MY AESTHETIC EDUCATION (PLUS SOME,)'' inspired by COURBET'S 1855 painting ''THE ARTIST'S STUDIO: A REAL ALLEGORY OF A SEVEN YEAR PHASE IN MY ARTISTIC AND MORAL LIFE.'' ''The tradition of studio paintings has always interested me,'' Mr. Oursler said. So he decided to create an artist's studio for the 21st century, with modern-day trappings like electronics, e-mail and surveillance. Just as Courbet's painting incorporated a host of people, Mr. Oursler's work does as well: A surveillance camera captures museum visitors and puts them in the installation. There are also inspirational objects like a model by the Rotterdam architect REM KOOLHAAS, and works by Mr. Oursler's wife, JACQUELINE HUMPHRIES, who is also an artist. ''Courbet always said his painting was unfinished so he gave me the license to make this organic,'' Mr. Oursler said. ''It keeps growing.''

With the help of Pierre Rosenberg, the former director of the Louvre and the show's guest curator, Louis-Antoine Prat, a Parisian collector and novelist, and his wife, Véronique, spent the last three decades amassing drawings that span three centuries and represent French artists active before 1900. The collection begins with examples of drawings by CALLOT and includes work by 18th-century figures like WATTEAU, BOUCHER and FRAGONARD.

A case in point, the METROPOLITAN MUSEUM's permanent galleries for European paintings have three guests on view through the summer. Catch them before they're gone. Time flies.    Two share the room of 16th-century Venetian pictures. The other is a little Rembrandt, on a pedestal under glass, in the Rembrandt room. Lessons in the virtues of keeping one's eyes open, they blend seamlessly among the heavyweights always hanging around the walls.    Rembrandt's ''ABRAHAM AND THE THREE ANGELS'' is a tiny miracle of intricate detail, a kind of adult version of those children's find-the-hidden-picture puzzlers, with a big, knotty tree in the background, a droopy-eared animal skulking in the darkness, and a shiny pitcher of water with which the white-maned Abraham silently washes the feet of one of the angels, who, it turns out, is actually God. Glowing like the high beams of a Hummer, God casts light onto a bunch of wine jugs and on the faces of the two angels beside Him, listening raptly to the prophecy of Isaac's birth. One of them absently munches on something, wide-eyed, like a boy at a campfire, hearing a ghost story.    The two Venetian pictures are moody war horses: Tintoretto's ''CHRIST AS THE MAN OF SORROWS'' has the quality of a self-portrait, its face deeply felt and lost in thought, teary-eyed, without being melodramatic. Tintoretto botched the connection between head and body (look at the left shoulder), but somehow this only makes the picture more expressive. And by Jacopo Bassano, ''THE MOCKING OF CHRIST,'' a blackened night scene of soldiers tormenting Jesus, sketchily painted, in imitation of Titian's sketchy style, includes some slippery flesh and silky robes, cascading like water over rocks. The composition is crisscrossed by a diagonal that links the sword of one soldier in the foreground to the upraised fist of another in the background, with Jesus's haggard face, half-lit, in the middle.

In Boston proper, ''GETTING EMOTIONAL'' at the INSTITUTE OF CONTEMPORARY ART (through Sept. 5) takes stimulation as its subject.

At the time, Clay, not averse to a bit of self-dramatization for publicity's sake, boasted that practicing his powerful hook and jab under water made him ''the fastest heavyweight in the ring.''

Books want to be held, read, thumbed through.    So people tend to stroll past them in exhibitions where there is much else to see, as there is in ''CÉZANNE to PICASSO,'' the show that just opened at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Devoted to the French dealer AMBROISE VOLLARD (1866-1939), it includes a gallery of illustrated books, two-thirds of the way through, where a visitor's patience and feet may start to flag.    Resist the fatigue. Mr. Vollard made his reputation, and a stupendous fortune, selling Cézannes and Gauguins around the turn of the century. This provided him with the comfort and means to do what he really wanted. In 1900 he published ''PARALLELEMENT'' by PAUL VERLAINE, with its erotic illustrations by BONNARD that float through the text. Bonnard's women and Verlaine's musing on religion and sexual perversion scandalized the French minister of justice, who demanded the work be recalled. Now, as it should be, it's a landmark in book design.    ''LE JARDIN DES SUPPLICES,'' by Octave Mirbeau, has equally remarkable color lithographs by RODIN. The story describes a dissolute Frenchman abroad in the Far East. He has an affair with a beautiful Englishwoman, who takes him to a prison with a garden where the flowers bloom from the blood and excrement of torture victims. Torture (Mirbeau goes into great detail and variety) functions as an erotic stimulant, inspiring Rodin to create swimmy, sensuous illustrations of women. Publishers, mindful of the recent scandal over ''Parallelement,'' naturally wanted nothing to do with the book. Except for Vollard, who persuaded Auguste Clot, the great printmaker, to reproduce Rodin's designs, which are so lovingly made that they look like original watercolors.

Much later his 1950 green brick building at 1407 Broadway, at 39th Street, punctuated by strip windows, became a notable example of early postwar modernism. You can follow his career's trajectory in the first extensive exhibition of Kahn's work, at the Miriam & Ira D. Wallach Art Gallery at Columbia University. ( The author Ayn Rand worked in Kahn's office as research for her book ''The Fountainhead.'') ''Ely Jacques Kahn, Architect: Beaux-Arts to Modernism'' is a timely show. A book of the same title, by Jewel Stern and John A. Stuart, was published by W. W.

The Modern Architecture Working Group has been lobbying the commission to designate 1407 Broadway a landmark too. Through Dec. 9, columbia.edu/cu/wallach/.    ''COURBET AND THE MODERN LANDSCAPE,'' which opens next Sunday at the Walters Art Museum in Baltimore, argues that Gustave Courbet reset the course of French landscape painting. The 19th-century painter is most appreciated today for his large figural works, but this exhibition makes a case that the immediacy and painterly self-expression of Courbet's depictions of nature helped to define issues of Modernism. The show, organized by the Walters with the J. Paul Getty Museum and the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, brings together a focused group of landscapes, done from 1855 to 1877 in Courbet's native Franche-Comté and on the coast of Normandy. One aspect that it emphasizes is Courbet's experimentation with techniques inspired by the new process of photography, like cropped images and textured surfaces. Because Courbet's paintings can evoke the sounds of ''a brisk wind, babbling stream, silence of snowfall, crashing surf,'' the Walters said, it is providing some aural accompaniment to the installation.

The FRICK COLLECTION, for example, will roll out ''DOMENICO TIEPOLO (1727-1804): A NEW TESTAMENT,'' which on Tuesday presents 60 large drawings in pen, brush and ink by the 18th-century Venetian artist, the eldest son of Giambattista and a virtuoso in his own right. The drawings are from a cycle of 313 that preoccupied Tiepolo fils for several years toward the end of his life, were mostly dispersed upon his death, and have never been the subject of an exhibition. Tracing a narrative extending from early Christianity to the acts of Paul, they are considerably more spiritual than the commedia dell'arte narratives for which Tiepolo is best known, but similarly suave and energetic and not without humorous moments. Some images also reflect the hustle and bustle of 18th-century Venetian life, including fashionable dress, palatial interiors and some of the city's familiar monuments. Through Jan. 7, 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700.    Also on Tuesday, the METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART'S ''AMERICANS IN PARIS, 1860-1900'' will open to the general public. This crowd-pleasing exhibition includes 100 works by 37 artists who flocked to the French capital to imbibe the latest styles, including Realism and Post-Impressionism, but especially Impressionism. The show's main news may be the number of women in this group, and the works of the inimitable MAURICE BRAZIL PRENDERGAST should be a high point. But the strongest presences will be two of this country's most adept expat painters: the hooded, elegantly somnambulant JAMES ABBOTT McNEIL WHISTLER and the dazzling (in small doses) JOHN SINGER SARGENT. Through Jan. 28, Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710.    Not to be outdone, the SCHOOL OF VISUAL ARTS will unveil a 50-year retrospective of JULES FEIFFER. Successful as a playwright, screenwriter and children's book author, Mr. Feiffer is best known as a cartoonist and social satirist. His pared-down, acerbic comic strips -- a staple of The Village Voice for several decades -- dissolved the line between, well, line and language while skewering the angst-ridden narcissism of contemporary life. The show will include preparatory sketches, proofs and rejected drawings as well as never-before-seen drawings from Mr. Feiffer's childhood, when he was a virtuoso in training. Through Dec. 2, 209 East 23rd Street, (212) 592-2145. THE WEEK AHEAD: Oct. 22-28","excerpt":"ART"},{"year":"2006","title":"Fans of the illustrator SAUL STEINBERG who have long clamored for his cartoons in The New Yorker can now immerse themselves in what is being billed as the first major retrospective of his work. The exhibition, ''Saul Steinberg: Illuminations,'' was organized by the Frances Lehman Loeb Art Center at Vassar College and opens Friday at the Morgan Library & Museum. It includes more than 100 drawings, printed items and sculpture by this artist, widely considered one of the great draftsmen of the modern era.    While Mr. Steinberg, who died in 1999, is perhaps most famous for his ''View of the World from 9th Avenue'' (1976) -- included in the show -- he also made three-dimensional objects, like ''Library'' (1986-87), an assemblage of wood and mixed media, and ''Mask'' (1961), made of pencil, crayon and ink on a cut brown paper bag. Through March 4, 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, morganlibrary.org.    A companion exhibition opens on the same day at the Museum of the City of New York. ''A City on Paper: Saul Steinberg's New York'' features more than 40 of his drawings. The show also includes objects from the museum's collection of the sort that inspired Steinberg: maps, aerial views, postcards. Fifth Avenue at 103rd Street, mcny.org.    In 1957 LOUIS COMFORT TIFFANY's 580-acre country estate in Oyster Bay, Laurelton Hall, burned down, but many of its architectural elements and interior features survived, all designed by Tiffany. These are now on display at the Metropolitan Museum of Art through May 20 (met.org).    Laurelton Hall -- which served as an art school, museum and retreat as well as Tiffany's home -- included an 84-room mansion, conservatories, tennis courts, a beach and 60 acres of formal gardens. The show, ''Louis Comfort Tiffany and Laurelton Hall -- An Artist's Country Estate,'' features leaded-glass windows, ceramics, blown glass and furniture from the house, plus photographs and architectural plans. Also included are his collections of Japanese, Chinese, and American Indian art.

The show ranges widely, from animation to media technology, fashion and graphic design, including high-tech medical fabrics that are the next step in rebuilding the human body. But for a window into the future, check out the creepy insectlike robots. They may one day replace us all. Friday through July 29, 2 East 91st Street, Manhattan, (212) 849-8400, ndm.si.edu.    The perennial clash of architecture and politics is revived with CLIP/ STAMP/FOLD: THE RADICAL ARCHITECTURE OF LITTLE MAGAZINES, at the Storefront for Art and Architecture. Published in an era when architects were still naïve enough to believe that design could be a form of social activism, the magazines are a wild mix of sex, psychedelics and architectural fantasy. But what's most stunning is their immediacy. By comparison, today's slick computer-generated images seem remote and inaccessible, the product of an age obsessed with surfaces. These magazines have a weight that makes you nostalgic for paper. 97 Kenmare Street, Little Italy, (212) 431-5795, storefrontnews.org.    LUCIAN FREUD, at the Acquavella Galleries, offers a more inward -- and masculine -- examination of the human psyche. Mr. Freud, now 81, is known for his tortured portraits of aging men and women, and he is a master at conveying inner as well as outer decay. The recent work displayed here, which includes paintings and drawings of landscapes, animals and Mr. Freud's friends, shows his perverse brand of realism at its best. A full-length portrait of Camilla Parker Bowles's ex-husband, Andrew, adds a hint of rotting aristocracy as well.

But just a few blocks away, the METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART will be showing ''GLITTER AND DOOM: GERMAN PORTRAITS FROM THE 1920s.''    On view starting Tuesday will be 40 paintings and 60 works on paper by 10 artists: Max Beckmann, Heinrich Maria Davringhausen, Otto Dix, George Grosz, Karl Hubbuch, Ludwig Meidner, Christian Schad, Rudolf Schlichter, Georg Scholz and Gert H. Wollheim.    These artists, who visually recorded the rampant unemployment, hyperinflation and social panic besetting German cities like Berlin, Düsseldorf and Dresden just after World War I, found subjects who represented all walks of life, epitomizing the extremes of the era, from cabaret dancers and wounded soldiers to wealthy bankers, military men and priests. Through Feb. 19, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org.    By contrast, all week Christie's, Sotheby's and Phillips de Pury & Company will be showing an embarrassing wealth of contemporary art up for sale day and night, beginning Tuesday at Sotheby's. Blue-chip artists like WARHOL and DE KOONING head an all-star list. At Sotheby's there is a collection of 90 paintings and sculptures from Roger and Josette Vanthournout, relatively unknown Belgian collectors. By far the most important of the works, which include examples by Damien Hirst, Lichtenstein, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Gerhard Richter and Carl Andre, is a 1968 FRANCIS BACON, ''VERSION NO. 2 OF LYING FIGURE WITH HYPODERMIC SYRINGE,'' in which Bacon took one of the most familiar subjects in art -- the reclining female nude -- and painted it as a tortured soul, as he painted many things. It is expected to sell for $9 million to $12 million.    Christie's has several important Warhols for sale, including the familiar portrait of Chairman Mao. Considered by experts to be one of best examples of Warhol's Mao paintings, this one measures 82 by 61 inches, and is expected to sell for $8 million to $12 million. It is being sold by the Daros Collection in Zurich. THE WEEK AHEAD: Nov. 12 - 18","excerpt":"ART"},{"year":"2006","title":"People have naturally been mobbing the GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM over the holidays for the stupendously glamorous survey ''SPANISH PAINTING FROM EL GRECO TO PICASSO.'' With the luxury of returning to it a few times, I have taken to visiting the show just to see one or two pictures, which in an ideal world is the way to see all exhibitions.    On these trips, I always seem to stop before VELÁZQUEZ's portrait of DON SEBASTIÁN DE MORRA. Above a pointy mustache and thick goatee, he's mesmerizing and formidable, notwithstanding that he is a dwarf. What is it about Velázquez's portraits, especially the ones of dwarfs and slaves? What makes them look so human? Maybe, paradoxically, it's the element of detachment. Velázquez painted his subjects without obvious feelings or expressions, with a kind of Spanish formality that forecloses easy decipherment. They look as strangers tend to look on the street, reserved and closed -- wide open to our interpretation. ''Spanish Painting From El Greco to Picasso,'' Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org, through March 28.    For comparison's sake, wander a few blocks south to the METROPOLITAN MUSEUM. Even during the holidays, the permanent galleries stay blessedly quiet. Not incidentally, they've got the equivalent of the Guggenheim's Spanish blockbuster every day of the year, including the greatest picture in the city, Velázquez's portrait of JUAN DE PAREJA, who was Velázquez's slave, a painter, a mulatto. You sense his pride, even arrogance, despite the reserve, and also an intimacy with Velázquez, which is absent in the portraits of royalty, among whom Velázquez was endlessly social climbing. Stop into the next room at the Met for EL GRECO's portrait of a cardinal, the one in watered-silk robes and round-rimmed glasses, clutching the arm of his chair, a letter on the floor at his feet. He was probably the grand inquisitor. He certainly looks as if he was. Who knows what the letter says. But clearly it wasn't good news. Unlike Velázquez's subjects, he's magnificently theatrical: part man, part bird of prey. Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. THE WEEK AHEAD: Dec. 24 - 30","excerpt":"ART"},{"year":"2006","title":"If any artist can be said to have lived -- and probably died -- for art, it is RAY JOHNSON. In January 1995, at 67, after an unorthodox and highly productive career that lasted more than four decades, he swam the backstroke out into the frigid waters of Sag Harbor Cove on Long Island and drowned.    Whether his death was his last, most dramatic performance-art piece is only one of many questions surrounding Mr. Johnson, who wrapped himself in considerable mystery. Partly because of this, he was often portrayed during his life as a wily art-world outsider. But he was deeply involved with many of the most influential artists of his day, including Andy Warhol, Willem de Kooning, Merce Cunningham, Barnett Newman, Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenberg.    This week at the FEIGEN CONTEMPORARY gallery in Chelsea is the last chance to see more than 40 hallucinatory, never-before-exhibited collages in which Mr. Johnson used his art friends and peers as raw material for his work. The collages mingle the names and sometimes the silhouettes of the famous and the favored with many of Mr. Johnson's trademark bunnies and a Freudian stew of other images: a urinating penis, a spatula, a mousetrap, a head shot of Montgomery Clift.    Mr. Johnson, among the earliest artists to exploit celebrities as subject matter, thought of some of the collages as portraits. In his ''portrait'' of the cartoonist Saul Steinberg, a curvaceous beauty seems poised, like Esther Williams, to take a dive off his nose. Through Saturday, 535 West 20th Street, (212) 929-0500.    Another interesting show that Mr. Johnson might have appreciated, ''ONE OF A KIND: THE STUDIO CRAFT MOVEMENT,'' opens at the Metropolitan Museum of Art on Friday. Following the history of the movement as it developed after World War II, the show focuses on 47 artists who used new materials and nontraditional methods in making furniture, housewares and other objects, infused with a strong sense of the abstract, the surreal and the playful. Through Sept. 3, (212) 535-7710. THE WEEK AHEAD: Dec. 17 - 23","excerpt":"ART"},{"year":"2006","title":"Art lovers, on your marks. It is time for the year-opening mad dash to see several of the fall's major museum exhibitions. In some instances your dashing ability may depend on how actively you intend to ring in the new year. Before heading to Times Square, remember that New Year's Eve day is the last chance to see -- up close, in a well-lighted room -- the small, resplendent ''CIMABUE AND EARLY ITALIAN DEVOTIONAL PAINTING'' at the Frick Collection. It reunites two newly attributed panels from an altarpiece by that Italian master with related works, including brilliantly colored ones from an illuminated manuscript that will probably not be seen side by side again soon. 1 East 70th Street, Manhattan, (212) 288-0700, frick.org.    New Year's Day at 5:45 p.m. is closing time for the Museum of Modern Art's ''EYE ON EUROPE: PRINTS, BOOKS & MULTIPLES, 1960 TO NOW,'' a marvelous polymorphous look at all kinds of modestly scaled, often subversive art from more than a dozen European countries. Political posters, etchings, Op Art silk-screens, handheld objects and postmodern text works: they are all here, from a mix of famous and unknown artists and collectives.

The achievement of Mr. Oiticica, a Brazilian who died in 1980 at 42, is as legendary as it is mysterious, and it will be presented in new detail, with 212 works ranging across 25 years.    These include a large group of nearly unknown early paintings that Mr. Oiticica, who grew up amid Brazil's leftist elite, began making in 1955. He was a precocious junior member of the Grupo Frente (1954) and a founder of Grupo Neo-Concrete (1959), which transformed the principles of Constructivism and gestalt psychology into a hybrid, participatory form of abstraction. His own development took the course of a dizzying love affair with color: he gradually expanded intense chromatic experience from the aesthetic and two-dimensional (a k a painting) to the social and spatial.    In her catalog essay Mari Carmen Ramirez, the Houston museum curator overseeing the exhibition, insightfully links Mr. Oiticica's fusion of color, material and space with the contemporary efforts of Yves Klein and Donald Judd. But Mr. Oiticica went further. Proceeding from reliefs to humble found objects, he then transferred his homey purism to colorful capes intended to be worn in parades and finally to makeshift structures involving colored planes of fabric and Plexiglas as well as sand, plants and plastic objects.    Despite his short career, his achievement reaches from Mondrian and Malevich, his early heroes, to performance art while incorporating specifically Brazilian forms like bossa nova, Carnival and the favelas' makeshift structures. By 1965 one critic had already called his art postmodern.

The series eventually took a religious turn with models posing as Buddhist deities. The pictures in his first major American solo show, at the INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY, continue in this spiritual trajectory. Filmed using long exposure times, figures, landscapes and religious icons have been turned into apparitions. People, art and museums may last for a while, Mr. Kim seems to say, but all things eventually melt away. Through Aug. 27, 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 857-0000.    Photography has been an existential mirror and also a social tool for the American artist LORNA SIMPSON, who has a midcareer survey at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles.    Ms. Simpson, born in 1960, uses combinations of image and text to examine gender, race and history from an oblique, conceptualist perspective. Her serial pictures of figures standing with their backs to the camera or with their faces obscured have implied narratives. But it is the viewer who fills in the story line. Through July 10, 250 South Grand Avenue, Los Angeles, (213) 626-6222.    If you miss the Simpson show in Los Angeles, you can catch it at the Whitney Museum of American Art next year and elsewhere.

What's so special about this place? By itself, the grove is nothing much to look at: just some dirt and trees and the pathways through the empty space around them. But walking through this porous barrier prepares the senses to be stunned by what lies beyond.   The Salk Institute for Biological Studies, designed by Louis I. Kahn between 1959 and 1965, has probably inspired more effusive praise -- and even more awestruck silence -- than any American building of this century. Kahn's two laboratory buildings, of poured concrete fitted with panels of weathered teak, are as ruggedly handsome as the coastal terrain from which they rise. The courtyard between them, a radiant void overlooking the ocean, sculptures form out of light and space.

They have mounted a late-night terror-art campaign against museums, galleries and critics they contend are guilty of sexism and racism, papering Manhattan with posters whose punchy graphics and deadeye accuracy have earned them the envy of advertisers and the enmity of the art-istocracy.

There, in the deep forest, far from the muffled ring of the fax machine that has become as much a part of her Warsaw existence as running water, she has been reclaiming huge trees that were, she says, \\"cut down and thrown out\\" because they were too irregular to be used for lumber and too dangerous to be allowed to stand on the side of roads. These gnarled, bumpy trees were, in effect, misfits, rejected because they had too much personality and individuality to fill any standardized role. Abakanowicz stripped them, inspected them and sometimes bandaged them or encased them in metal. Wounded yet imposing and irrepressible, they form a growing sculptural series called \\"War Games\\" that is a statement of heroic survival and will.    No contemporary artist has mounted a more sustained attack on the very ideas of conformity and confinement. From the time she was an art student in Warsaw in 1950, Abakanowicz (pronounced aba-ka-KNOW-vitch) has been struggling against authority -- \\"I hate rules,\\" she says -- and \\"trying to escape from the world of categories.\\" Politics under Communism was inflexible","excerpt":"art was not.

Thirty years ago at the WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART an exhibition of RICHARD TUTTLE, then a precocious rising star, occasioned a critical spat that got the curator canned for doing the show and has gone down in the annals of the New York art world for its nastiness. In the way these things work, the event also assured Mr. Tuttle enduring notoriety, notwithstanding the grief it caused him. Fickle fashion has shifted over the years, along with Mr. Tuttle's exact relationship to the spotlight, but in recent years he has become a senior statesman and a particular inspiration to young artists for whom his provocatively discreet and exquisite way of making sculptures out of nothing more than, say, a piece of string or a wire, or painting waferboard, or drawing the most delicate scribbles on sheets of paper, is a model of formal integrity.    Starting Thursday, he will return to the Whitney in a traveling retrospective, one of the art season's anticipated shows. It should set off hair-trigger conservatives again. Meanwhile, it will give Mr. Tuttle's growing legions of admirers a chance to claim redemption and a fresh generation a look at his career. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676.    Speaking of redemption, in Atlanta 23 years ago the HIGH MUSEUM OF ART opened to much fanfare. Designed by Richard Meier, it was hailed by architecture critics as a handsome and innovative building, a landmark for the city. But it turned out to be a supremely difficult place for exhibiting art and a poster child for this clash of interests. On Saturday, the High will open an expansion by RENZO PIANO, the brand-name architect du jour for museums seeking galleries that are not just sublimely elegant but also practical. Among other things, the new quarters give the High room to show loans from the Louvre, enhancing this ambitious city's claim to be a cultural magnet with not just a novel building but also great art, now aptly housed, inside it. 1280 Peachtree Street, (404) 733-4400.

But many photographers travel in pursuit of something more than just another pretty place. STEPHEN SHORE, for example, traveled all over the United States in 1972 and '73, and the almost 250 small, jewel-bright color pictures that resulted suggest a wry, downbeat search for the American soul in the most ordinary of people and situations. ''American Surfaces'' continues at the P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, through Jan. 23.    More recently, the French photographer LISE SARFATI traveled around the United States with a sensitive eye for beautiful, seemingly disaffected young people -- teenage girls and 20-something women, mostly. Her sumptuous color photographs portraying them in their homes and in stores exude feelings of loneliness, ennui and smoldering eroticism. Ms. Sarfati's exhibition, ''A New Life,'' is on view at Yossi Milo Gallery, 525 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 414-0370, through Nov. 26.    In the case of the black-and-white pictures shot in Mexican border towns by the Mexican photojournalist JULIÁN CARDONA, it is not only the photographer but his subjects who are on the move as well. They are poor people from Mexico and Central American countries hoping and attempting to enter the United States to find work there -- legally and otherwise. With brief captions explaining the often desperate circumstances of each picture, the show provides a sadly illuminating glimpse of what travel means for many of the world's less privileged citizens. Mr. Cardona's exhibition is at the Cue Art Foundation, 511 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 206-3583, through Dec. 3.

For starters, the Paris-based firm of Wildenstein & Company has mounted ''THE ARTS OF FRANCE FROM FRANÇOIS Ier TO NAPOLEON Ier,'' a lavish tribute to the 100th anniversary of its Manhattan branch. Devoted to paintings and sculptures that have passed through Wildenstein's hands or remain in its possession, there are more than 150 offerings, from JEAN CLOUET's 1518 portrait ''François I as John the Baptist'' to INGRES's worldly, superbly drawn pencil-and-wash portrait of ''Monsignor Cortois de Pressigny, French Ambassador to the Vatican'' (1816). 19 East 64th Street, (212) 879-0500, through Jan. 6.

And then there's the campy academic extravaganza known as ''THE LEGACY OF HOMER: FOUR CENTURIES OF ART FROM THE ÉCOLE NATIONALE SUPÉRIEURE DES BEAUX-ARTS, PARIS.'' It deals with works from the 17th to the 19th century pertaining to Homeric legend by students at the government-sponsored École des Beaux-Arts. The show has its moments, but what really shines among the stagey, attitudinous canvases here -- including works by POUSSIN, INGRES and DAVID -- is a hilarious set of lithographs by HONORÉ DAUMIER that includes scenes like a fat, slovenly Helen, in myth the beauteous cause of the Trojan War, trotting behind her lordly husband, Menelaus, as she thumbs her nose at him.

The design features two white walls at a 90-degree angle with a stairway descending into a sunken patio that features the living quarters surrounding it on two sides, recessed below ground, using the earth's covering to insulate them.

The show, which opens on Sunday and runs through March 12 at two Los Angeles museums -- the Hammer Museum and the Museum of Contemporary Art -- includes more than 500 original drawings. The Hammer focuses on strip artists, from WINSOR McCAY (''Little Nemo in Slumberland'') and GEORGE HERRIMAN (''Krazy Kat'') to CHESTER GOULD (''Dick Tracy'') and CHARLES SCHULTZ (''Peanuts''), while MoCA considers the rise of comic books and graphic novels, including works by JACK KIRBY, R.

Those hoping to visit commercial art galleries may find that many are closed. So call ahead. As for museums, well, that's where everyone seems to be: from wandering tourists to harried locals shepherding visiting relatives, with or without footloose children.    If you haven't yet seen the exhibitions of VAN GOGH drawings at the METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART (Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710) or MEMLING portraits at the FRICK COLLECTION (1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700), chances are you won't. Both close on Saturday and have been pretty much packed for weeks. You may also have trouble seeing ''RARA AVIS: SELECTIONS FROM THE IRIS BARREL APFEL COLLECTION'' at the Met's Costume Institute, although sitting out the holiday crush is an option here, since it closes on Jan. 22. The first exhibition at the Institute devoted to one person's wardrobe, the Apfel show is a startling and profound delight and one of the season's sleepers. Ms. Apfel, 84, is a longtime figure in the fashion world and founder of a textile firm, but she is also an artist who uses her own trim frame as an armature. Nearly each of the show's 68 ensembles is a kind of assemblage that wittily mixes styles, designers and cultures, plus colors, textiles and piles of jewelry from around the world (especially bangles). Before multiculturalism was a word, Ms. Apfel was wearing it.    Among the exhibitions that will close on Saturday is ''MARKS OF DISTINCTION'' at the NATIONAL ACADEMY MUSEUM (Fifth Avenue at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880), with 80 American drawings and watercolors spanning 200 years (Benjamin West to Lee Bontecou) from the Hood Museum of Art at Dartmouth College. Meanwhile, some slightly larger windows of opportunity exist. People who want to peruse The NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY's exhibition celebrating the 150th anniversary of the publication of WALT WHITMAN's ''LEAVES OF GRASS'' can do so until Jan. 7 (Fifth Avenue, at 42nd Street, (212) 869-8069) .

Davies will be on view at the BROOKLYN MUSEUM'S LUCE VISIBLE STORAGE STUDY CENTER until Jan. 8 (200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000). And the MUSEUM OF MODERN ART's survey of ELIZABETH MURRAY's determined painting career, from square and flat to irregular and bulging, can be seen through Jan. 9 (11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400).

Laughlin, a photographer for the Army Corps of Engineers, had the task of documenting that agency's levee projects in the 1930's and 40's, and one wonders what he would have come up with had he focused his attention more intently on the heroic infrastructure that defined that era. Instead, he turned his attention to romantic subjects -- from antebellum mansions to frayed relics of a dying Southern aristocracy. The pictures have the dark, dreamy quality of Eugène Atget's Paris, although their impact is more fleeting. Benjamin Franklin Parkway at 26th Street, (215) 763-8100, through April 30.    Those in search of a more pious artistic experience can stop by the METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART's show on ANTONELLO DA MESSINA. The lifelike figures in Messina's portraits, enveloped in rich colors, are tours de force of the quattrocento. The serene gaze of his ''Virgin Annunciate'' has been compared to Leonardo da Vinci's ''Mona Lisa.'' It is a masterpiece. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, through March 5.    But the most hotly awaited show at the Met may be ROBERT RAUSCHENBERG's ''COMBINES,'' opening on Tuesday. These tough, almost brutal paintings, in which the artist sought to combine the detritus of everyday life -- used tires, discarded fabrics, a stuffed bird -- with the substance of artistic reverie, have a tactile immediacy that is as fresh today as when the art dealer Leo Castelli first discovered them in Rauschenberg's cluttered, underheated SoHo studio in the 1950's.

On Wednesday the Aldrich ushers in a group show of 10 artists whose work challenges preconceived ideas of what form American Indian-influenced art can take.    Curators say the work in the exhibition ''NO RESERVATIONS: NATIVE AMERICAN HISTORY AND CULTURE IN CONTEMPORARY ART'' acknowledges the past while integrating modern and global cultural influences. Reaching out to the society, one of the artists, Marie Watt, has collected hundreds of blankets with stories attached to them that will be combined in one installation before they are distributed to the homeless. Through Feb. 25, 258 Main Street, Ridgefield, Conn.    ''WALKER EVANS: SILVER AND CARBON'' opens at UBS on Thursday. The show will feature about 90 photographs from 1935 and '36, including stark and mysterious portraits, street scenes, landscapes and images of businesses and homes. A self-taught photographer with a documentary style, Evans was commissioned by the Farm Security Administration to record the lives of rural families during the Depression. The show, organized by the Yale University School of Art, where Evans served on the faculty, will include vintage silver gelatin prints that testify to his devotion to detail.

More than 50 shows are set to open, most of them Thursday night in Chelsea. With good weather, the evening should be, well, at least fun, and the air riven with greetings of ''How was your summer?'' (meaning the last three weeks of August) and ''Here we go again,'' with or without rolled eyes. The museum exhibitions will be slower to kick in, with several of the season's biggest scheduled to open next week.    But there are some early birds. On Thursday the Asia Society will open ''ONE WAY OR ANOTHER: ASIAN AMERICAN ART NOW,'' an exhibition of 17 young, mostly female talents that includes Patty Chang, Laurel Nakadate, Mika Tajima, Mari Eastman and the newcomer Xavier Cha. In her much-discussed Chelsea debut last spring, Ms. Cha, a Los Angeles performance artist and sculptor, spent a great deal of time in a monumental cornucopia of fruits and vegetables, her feet protruding among the colorful produce. Who knows what endurance test she will dream up next? Through Dec. 10, 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 327-9213.    On Friday the New York Public Library unveils ''A RAKISH HISTORY OF MEN'S WEAR CLOTHING,'' timed to coincide with the start of Fashion Week in Bryant Park, the library's backyard. The show's nearly 200 prints, photographs, watercolors, posters, advertisements, fashion illustrations and illustrated books, mostly from the library's extensive art and architecture collection, will trace the evolution of masculine garments and style from antiquity to the present. Togas to flip-flops perhaps? Sections devoted to the rise of dandyism and the genesis of the modern suit should be useful follow-ups to some of the more intriguing parts of the Metropolitan Museums of Art's ''Anglomania'' exhibition, which, by the way, closes Monday. Through April 7, (212) 869-8089.    Also on Saturday the Institute of Contemporary Art in Philadelphia will open ''JOHN ARMLEDER: ABOUT NOTHING, WORKS ON PAPER, 1962-2007,'' a floor-to-ceiling, wall-to-wall survey of hundreds of drawings, watercolors and collages. This sly, peripatetic Swiss maverick is best known for a relatively funky, laid-back brand of 1980's Neo-Geo that riffed on modernist idealism with color-coordinated combos of worn mid-century furniture and his own distinctly offhand abstract paintings. The show's time span alone indicates a career that has covered quite a bit more ground than many people might realize.

The only things missing are tumbleweeds and a Sergio Leone soundtrack. But the limousines started finding their way back last week as the first in a burst of new shows opened. And this week the streets will be even busier as more shows open and crowds take advantage of the last precious month of milling-outside weather.    Shows by two veteran provocateurs, one American and the other German, are among those worth seeing. At the Gladstone Gallery is an exhibition of the black-and-white architectural photographs of CATHERINE OPIE, who first made her name with gorgeously formal pictures of herself and others, often heavily pierced and tattooed, in drag, in sadomasochistic gear and sometimes in pain.    But for the last decade Ms. Opie, a professor of photography at the University of California, Los Angeles, has turned her camera on the facades of houses in Bel-Air and Beverly Hills, the freeways and minimalls of Los Angeles, and the often crumbling roadside scenes that she has come upon while driving around the country. Ms. Opie, who has called herself ''a twisted social documentary photographer,'' manages to infuse these banal urban and suburban landscapes with the same kind of other-ness and vague unease of her portraits. Through Oct. 14, 515 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 206-9300.    The German artist GEORG HEROLD, who is having an exhibition at the Friedrich Petzel Gallery, has also long worked at the intersection of the mundane and the mutinous. In his case the materials he uses -- baking powder, vodka bottles, lone bricks stuffed into expanses of foam rubber, underwear stretched on wire, ''paintings'' made with shellacked caviar -- flirt humorously and provocatively with definitions of art and with art's power (or lack of it) to make political statements.    Mr. Herold has described his work as constructions of ''stupid materials,'' but they are ones that can ask intelligent and interesting questions.

''PASSION FOR ASIA,'' at the Asia Society through Sept. 3, draws on the collections of generations of Rockefellers who have been captivated by Asian culture since their early days as oil barons. Many of these objects once decorated the family's homes, and the installation has an intimacy that is rare in New York museums. Be prepared for lots of gold: gold-flecked paintings, tiny gilded sculptures. There are also Chinese ceramics and a spiritually uplifting sampling of Buddhist religious art. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 288-6400.    At the underappreciated Rubin Museum of Art, ''HOLY MADNESS'' presents a marvelous portrait of the degenerate mystics, ragged exhibitionists, charismatic troublemakers and eccentric spiritual teachers who made up the South Asian Siddhas. The show, which runs through Sept. 4, includes a painting of the snarling ''Wrathful Black Lady,'' whose laudable mission was to shake people out of their delusions. There is even a portrait of the Siddha Virupa arguing over a bar tab. 150 West 17th Street, Manhattan, (212) 620-5000.    Finally, for those who feel a need to slip back momentarily into a more confident if not necessarily more innocent era in American culture, ''FULL HOUSE'' at the Whitney Museum of American Art highlights some critical moments in the history of American art. Minimalism, Pop Art and Abstract Expressionism get their due, and a gallery is devoted to the work of Edward Hopper, whose career has been aggressively promoted by the Whitney for more than half a century.

Here are three notable shows that opened or will open this month:    HENRI ROUSSEAU, the great early-20th-century self-taught painter of tropical forests, magical people and wild animals, is the subject of ''Jungles in Paris,'' a major retrospective at the NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART that opened last Sunday. Among the 49 works are landscapes, portraits, allegories and the largest selection of Rousseau's jungle paintings ever assembled. The show revises conventional views of the artist as a naïve bumpkin. It seems he constructed his images with help from books, magazines, postcards and research trips to botanical gardens. The exhibition, which includes documents, popular ephemera and other materials, portrays Rousseau as a savvy proto-Pop artist. Constitution Avenue NW, between Third and Seventh Streets, Washington, through Oct. 15, (202) 737-4215.    In the late 1920's and early 30's a small, influential group of designers in the Soviet Union began to create patterned textiles using motifs like tractors, factories, airplanes and the hammer and sickle. The idea was to clothe workers and peasants in propaganda for the new Communist regime.

The show's more than 400 works -- collage, montage, painting, film, photography, sound recordings -- were made from 1916 to 1924, as a response to World War I and the emerging glorification of machine culture. They reflect the many forms of Dada, including Zurich's experiments in radical abstraction, New York's readymades and machine portraits, Berlin's political montages, Cologne's hallucinatory dream imagery and Paris's critiques of painterly traditions. Among the nearly 50 artists represented are HANS ARP, KURT SCHWITTERS, MARCEL DUCHAMP, GEORGE GROSZ, MAX ERNST, MAN RAY and HANNAH HÖCH. Through Sept. 11. (212) 708-9400.

Created by PABLO CASTRO and JENNIFER LEE, the design features seven curved, interconnected shells made of plywood and polypropylene mesh. Wooden tidal pools, water misters and a frigidarium -- using foil bubble insulation and ice -- will offer relief from the heat -- a blessing on Saturdays, when the courtyard is the site of the ''Warm Up'' summer dance parties.

The COLONNA ALTARPIECE, painted by Raphael for a Perugino convent, was dismantled in 1663, its pieces scattered among several owners, including Queen Christina of Sweden, the Colonna family in Rome and the kings of Naples and the Two Sicilies. In 1901 the main panel and lunette were acquired by J. Pierpont Morgan for the startling sum of two million francs. Newspapers called it the most important painting to cross the Atlantic. Since 1916 it has been at the Met.    An exhibition opening on Tuesday will reunite these pieces with the predella, the small narrative paintings that run along the bottom of the altarpiece. It will also display a group of Raphael's drawings and paintings produced around the time he painted the altarpiece. Through Sept. 3. (212) 535-7710.

Part of a regionwide celebration of Dutch art and culture, the two shows are pegged to the 400th anniversary of Rembrandt's birth, and they include work by REMBRANDT (1606-69), his contemporaries and his immediate predecessors..    Some, like HENDRICK GOLTZIUS (1558-1617) and LUCAS VAN LEYDEN (1494-1533) as well as Rembrandt, revolutionized printmaking techniques in an age when artists were taking on a broader range of subject matter, including portraits, mythological scenes, landscapes and religious works.    ''GOING BAROQUE: 17TH-CENTURY DUTCH MASTERWORKS'' at the Museum of Fine Arts in Springfield, features six etchings by Rembrandt, including ''Christ Preaching,'' whose deep spirituality is enhanced by its handling of light, and the more secular ''Man With Hand to Brow,'' depicting a bearded ponderer. Goltzius and van Leyden are well represented too, with Goltzius at the top of his form in the woodblock print ''Neptune,'' a powerful, witty version of the god riding a huge sea dragon.

It promises to be big, with about 165 paintings and drawings, nearly 40 of them Picassos, as well as a small number of prints, sculptures and photographs. Much of the focus will be on nine American artists who have been particularly influenced by Picasso and whose work has, in turn, had an impact on the next generation of artists in this country: Stuart Davis, Willem de Kooning, Arshile Gorky, John Graham, Jasper Johns, Roy Lichtenstein, Jackson Pollock, David Smith and Max Weber.

But ''STILL POINTS OF A TURNING WORLD,'' the international biennial opening next Sunday at Site Santa Fe in New Mexico, could be the exception. KLAUS OTTMANN, the independent curator and critic who organized this latest incarnation -- the sixth -- has tackled head-on the chronic mega-biennial blights of self-obliterating sprawl and play-it-safe predictability. Not only do most biennials usually represent 50 to 100 artists, they also tend to concentrate on pretty much the same 50 to 100. You can rarely locate a curatorial viewpoint, and by the time you've waded through the show, you're usually too exhausted to care. Mr. Ottmann opted for radical reduction: his biennial has a mere 13 artists and, what's more, most of them are not among the usual suspects. They're from different continents, work in different mediums and range tremendously in age and prominence. Some, like the installation artist WOLFGANG LAIB, are former biennial regulars who haven't been so visible lately. Others, like the Conceptual painter JENNIFER BARTLETT and the post-Minimalist sculptor ROBERT GROSVENOR, are veterans of the American scene who have never been part of the circuit. Several are younger artists on their way up, like the performance-video artist PATTY CHANG, the painting-installation artist WANGECHI MUTU, the painter-videoist STEPHEN DEAN and a three-year-old Norwegian collective called THORNS LTD. Even the best known on the list have not attained white-hot art stardom: MIROSLAW BALKA, PETER DOIG, CRISTINA IGLESIAS, JONATHAN MEESE, CARSTEN NICOLAI and CATHERINE OPIE. Each artist will have plenty of space in Site Santa Fe's cavernous shedlike building. Such art-friendliness could also yield viewer-friendliness. Some people worry that Mr. Ottmann may have gone overboard and that his show actually has too few artists.

Few artists were able to expose the defects and absurdities of a mechanized society like the Dadaists, the loose-knit group of artists whose work was a reaction to the grinding carnage of World War I. But what's surprising about the show is the creative range of the works, which were produced between 1916 and 1924: from HANNAH HÖCH's wonderfully bizarre photomontages to the more politically edgy work of JOHN HEARTFIELD. The show traces the wanderings of Dada's principal actors from Zurich to Cologne, Hanover, Berlin, Paris and New York, and in the process reveals a movement that is as fresh -- and relevant -- today as it was in a Europe edging toward World War II.

''COURBET AND THE MODERN LANDSCAPE,'' at the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles, is a more soothing experience. The exhibition focuses on one of the more overlooked aspects of Gustave Courbet's oeuvre: the group of paintings he completed around the 1860's in the countryside near the provincial town of Ornans, where he grew up. His carefully cropped images, influenced by the emergence of photography, and his penchant for applying paint with palette knives, rags and sponges made him a monumental figure in art's slide toward abstraction.

But as you get closer, the calm of Audubon gives way to the creepiness of Francis Bacon and sometimes even to the horrors of Wes Craven. (In one of Mr. Ford's works, a gorgeously rendered black-maned lion is poised to make a meal out of a fallen cabin boy.)    Beginning Friday, the Brooklyn Museum will present more than 50 of Ford's meticulous large-scale watercolors made since the 1990's, works that question the beauty and simplicity of nature and man's relationship to it. In one painting of an owl on a branch, it is clear on closer inspection that the owl is there only because a trapper has wired him to the tree to lure smaller birds. In another, a kind of Pietà, a wood duck looms over a fallen colleague, apparently shot down, as other ducks plummet from the sky in the background.    ''The big, big thing I'm always looking for in my work,'' Mr. Ford has said, ''is a sort of attraction-repulsion thing, where the stuff is beautiful to begin with until you notice that some sort of horrible violence is about to happen or is in the middle of happening.''

Founded by Katherine Drier, Marcel Duchamp and Man Ray in 1920, its 47th Street gallery introduced New Yorkers to a range of modern artists, from Klee to Kandinsky. Dreier, perhaps the most dedicated to the cause, also organized a relentless schedule of dance recitals, lectures and film screenings. She also collected art. ''THE SOCIÉTÉ ANONYME: MODERNISM FOR AMERICA'' is a rare glimpse into a result of that effort: one of the most eclectic collections of avant-garde paintings, sculpture and memorabilia anywhere in America. Through Jan. 21, Phillips Collection, Washington.    Two hundred years after the artist's death, ''FRAGONARD AND THE FRENCH TRADITION'' at the Morgan Library & Museum chronicles this Frenchman's evolution from well-behaved academician to unrestrained sensualist. The show, which includes a portrait of a cherubic Neapolitan girl and various courtly figures, places Fragonard's work in the context of his often more heavy-hearted contemporaries as well as lesser known followers like François-André Vincent. Of these Fragonard was possibly the most individualistic. His work is also is a burst of sentimentality before the high-minded neo-Classicism that would follow just before the outbreak of revolution. Through Jan. 7, 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street.    Few artists are as closely identified with a city as CANALETTO is with Venice. Rising to prominence at a time when that city's charms had not yet been suffocated under waves of zombie-eyed tourists, this celebrated 18th-century painter helped shape our romantic image of his native city with light-saturated images of its liquid landmarks. Now ''CANALETTO IN ENGLAND: A VENETIAN ARTIST ABROAD, 1746-1755,'' demonstrates that Venice's greatest promoter could muster an appreciation for other cities as well. The show includes paintings of contemporary architectural works like the recently completed Westminster Bridge. But the big attraction is his capricci: fantastical, hallucinogenic views of imaginary landscapes, suggesting that he carried the delirious spirit of Venice in his blood, even on foreign territory. Through Dec. 31, Yale Center for British Art, New Haven. THE WEEK AHEAD: Oct. 15 - 21","excerpt":"ART/ARCHITECTURE"},{"year":"2006","title":"This is the week of serious overprogramming in the art world. First, the Whitney Biennial is in full swing. On Friday, the Armory Show, one of the nation's largest contemporary art fairs, opens on the piers on 12th Avenue at 50th and 52nd Streets. And by midweek a huge contingent of New York dealers and collectors will be jetting to Maastricht, the Netherlands, for the mammoth European Fine Art Fair, which also begins on Friday.    But there are many options for those who want to avoid the crush. One is at the Sara Meltzer Gallery, which is opening a new space in Chelsea. As part of a group exhibition, the artist NEIL GOLDBERG will be showing enlarged stills from a long-term video project that deals with a special form of New York disappointment: missing the subway. For countless hours, Mr. Goldberg has focused his handheld camera on people just as the subway doors closed on them, registering fleeting but affecting portraits of mundane misfortune. On a whim recently, he decided to enlarge stills of some riders' faces to as large as 50 by 60 inches and was struck by the results, which he said ''look like moments from the history of painting.'' It might just be the subway, but the faces reminded him ''of the expressions in Renaissance depictions of religious suffering and ecstasy.'' Through April 8, at 525-531 West 26th Street, (212) 727-9330 or www.sarameltzergallery.com.    A photography exhibit on a much grander scale is ''Snap Judgments: New Positions in Contemporary African Photography,'' a highly anticipated survey of more than 200 works by 35 artists at the International Center of Photography. Organized by OKWUI ENWEZOR, who has lately made a name for himself as a globetrotting art curator, the exhibition's goal is more ambitious than just a wide sampling of new African photography. It is, according to the center, nothing less than to ''seek to define the nature of contemporary African art'' itself. Through May 28, at 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street. (212) 857-0000 or www.icp.org. THE WEEK AHEAD: March 5-March 11","excerpt":"ART/ARCHITECTURE"},{"year":"2006","title":"In 1813, Mir Izzatullah, an Indian Muslim and British spy, watching caravans leave Bukhara for Siberia and Afghanistan, reported that along with bales of muslin, calico and yarn, camels were lugging colored robes. It was the first mention in Europe of ikat silks from Central Asia. A technique known since the first millennium in many other parts of the world, the making of ikat textiles entails dyeing individual threads before they are placed onto a loom and woven into fabric. The process, at its extreme, enlists silk makers, silk reelers, warpers, weavers and dyers, the threads going back and forth between dyers and binders, who tie the threads when each new color is applied. Double ikats, objects of often mind-boggling complexity, are designs dyed on both the warp and the weft.    Indonesia is where some of the greatest ikat fabrics come from. ''THE FABRIC OF LIFE: IKAT TEXTILES OF INDONESIA,'' with works mostly from the 19th century, is one of those little exhibitions tucked into the Rockefeller Wing of the Metropolitan Museum of Art whose wallop is all out of sync with its size. It's a knockout.    From Borneo come skirts that women of the Iban people donned for rituals like offering food to the gods and combing the hair of sacrificial pigs. From Sumba come ikat textiles called hinggi, patterned shrouds that shepherded men from this world to the next. The richer the man, the more hinggi he wore and the more colorful they were: dead nobles were wrapped up in scores of them, sometimes for years, before their funerals.    The most elaborate ikats here, embroidered with gold, are abstractions of supernatural grace, all of them eyeballed by their designers, without templates or stencils, so that there is a built-in irregularity. Ikat designers embraced variety.    Indonesia was a cultural crossroad, absorbing many influences, and ikat designs reflected this. But the ones here, made when industrialization was new, are also eloquent statements about the persistence of traditional values and the irreproducibility of human touch. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710. THE WEEK AHEAD: March 12 - March 18","excerpt":"ART/ARCHITECTURE"},{"year":"2006","title":"The first week of January is a slow one in the art world, but there are some off-the-beaten-track shows to be found. One is an exhibition of paintings at the NEW YORK TRANSIT MUSEUM. After the transit strike, it might be a good way to remind yourself of the redeeming qualities of the subway, including some qualities you'd never considered. The show features 30 pastel and charcoal drawings, oil paintings and linoleum block prints by LAURA CANTOR, who has worked for New York City Transit for 23 years as a subway car inspector. Her work shows exactly what she sees on the job, unadorned but transformed with color. In one pastel, she renders the magnetic latch on an R62 subway car, the kind of car still in use on the Lexington and other lines. The work makes you wonder what would have happened if Thomas Hart Benton had spent some time under a subway train. Corner of Boerum Place and Schermerhorn Street in Brooklyn Heights, (718) 694-1600, through April 9.    A completely different kind of unusual can be found at the SEAN KELLY GALLERY. MARINA ABRAMOVIC, the radical performance artist who recently spent seven grueling nights onstage in the rotunda of the Guggenheim, often doing violence to herself, has created an elaborate video work that examines ancient connections between sexuality and folklore. Titled ''BALKAN EROTIC EPIC,'' the videos are framed by Ms. Abramovic, in a professorial role, explaining some of the more unexpected ways in which sexuality and the body were employed in Balkan pagan traditions and in other ancient cultures. (If it rained too much in a village, for example, women would run into the fields and lift their skirts to scare the gods and end the rain.) In adjoining videos, performers hired by the artist enact such rituals, sometimes faithfully and sometimes in ways that reimagine the folklore. 528 West 29th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-1181, through Jan. 21. THE WEEK AHEAD: Jan. 1 - Jan. 7","excerpt":"ART/ARCHITECTURE"},{"year":"2006","title":"Several major exhibitions are opening in New York this week. One of the most interesting will last only three days: a selection of 60 works from the legendary VÉRITÉ COLLECTION OF AFRICAN ART at Tambaran Gallery (5 East 82nd Street, 212-570-0655 ), Thursday through Saturday. This 500-work collection, which will be auctioned at the Hôtel Drouot in Paris on June 17 and 18, was built over two generations by the Vérité family, whose Galerie Carrefour was frequented by curators and artists alike, Picasso included.    Meanwhile, at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (212-535-7710), ''ANGLOMANIA: TRADITION AND TRANSGRESSION IN BRITISH FASHION'' will disturb the usual hauteur of the museum's 18th-century English period rooms with displays of mannequins outfitted in mostly 20th-century, sometimes punk ensembles. At the Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum (2 East 91st Street, 212-849-8400), ''FEEDING DESIRE: DESIGN AND THE TOOLS OF THE TABLE'' will explore the various means by which people have put food in their mouths with a display of five centuries (and 300 pieces) of flatware, cutlery and other dining accessories. At the Museum of Modern Art (212-708-9400), ''AGAINST THE GRAIN: CONTEMPORARY ART FROM THE EDWARD R. BROIDA COLLECTION'' will undoubtedly be a great improvement over the museum's infamous display of its UBS collection, if only because its 100 paintings, sculptures, drawings and prints by 38 American artists include the 1975-76 ''Rhapsody,'' Jennifer Bartlett's monumental, underappreciated steel-plate meditation on painting. In addition, the Broida gift adds large caches of work by Jake Berthot, Vija Celmins, Philip Guston, Kenneth Price and Christopher Wilmarth to MoMA's holdings.    Last but not least, the New York Public Library (Fifth Avenue at 42nd Street, 212-869-8089) will circle back to France (minus the colonialism) with ''LIVRES D'ARTISTES: ARTISTS AND POETS IN DIALOGUE,'' an exhibition of nearly 126 illustrated books of poetry made between 1874 and 1999. The names on the spines will include Manet and Mallarmé, Tristan Tzara and Joan Miró. Many of the books are one of a kind and once belonged to Jacques Doucet, an important patron of poets, designers, artists and bookbinders, who bequeathed his library to the French people.

Enlarged in 1974 and 1998, and now enhanced for the third time, the museum is opening a 113,000-square-foot wing, designed by Michael Graves and named for Target, the Minneapolis-based retailer that contributed more than $10 million to the building fund. With other renovations factored in, the new space amounts to an increase of 40 percent in exhibition area.    What's in it for viewers? Well, the grand opening next Sunday will salute the reinstallation of much of the permanent collection of almost 100,000 works, covering more than 5,000 years of art history. It includes one of the major collections of Asian art in the United States, with 20,000 square feet devoted to the installation of Chinese art alone. And six new galleries have been added to the nine existing ones for one of the country's largest permanent installations of Japanese art.    Four new shows will kick off the exhibition program. ''The Surreal Calder'' explores the Surrealist origins of the American sculptor Alexander Calder. ''From Dürer to Cassatt: Five Centuries of Master Prints From the Jones Collection'' plays up the 1916 gift from Herschel V. Jones, publisher of The Minneapolis Journal, that forms the core of the museum's print holdings. ''Highlights From the Harrison Collection of Fine Photographs (1992-2006)'' includes 100 works by major 20th-century figures.

The show tracks the evolution of Pollock's art from drawings and paintings of human and imaginary beings in the middle to late 30's, through increasingly abstract symbolic works in the 40's, to the totally nonrepresentational paintings made by dripping, pouring and splattering. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, through Sept. 29.    Meanwhile a major exhibition of new paintings by the German Neo-Expressionist ANSELM KIEFER  opens on Saturday at the Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum. In keeping with Mr. Kiefer's penchant for the big statement, the show is titled ''VELIMIR CHLEBNIKOV'' after a visionary leader and thinker of the pre-World War II Russian avant-garde, and it consists of a suite of 30 paintings displayed in an outdoor steel pavilion designed by Mr. Kiefer. 258 Main Street, Ridgefield, Conn., (203) 438-4519, through Oct. 1.

Ousmane Sembene's \\"Guelwaar\\" (at Lincoln Plaza Cinemas in Manhattan) offers a deceptively plain, wonderfully well-observed portrait of Senegalese society, as it is mirrored by an elaborately described tribal dispute. Starting small, with a mixup that mushrooms into a communal battle, Mr. Sembene's film shares some remarkable (and clearly coincidental) similarities with Spike Lee's \\"Do the Right Thing.\\" But this septuagenarian African film maker supplies much quieter insights, and a subtler view of human nature. Critics' Choices","excerpt":"Artful Activities for Summer's Wane"},{"year":"1993","title":"Theater    Even people who don't like mime -- and their numbers, one hears, are legion -- should give \\"Fool Moon\\" a chance before it closes on Sunday. This revue, created by and starring Bill Irwin and David Shiner, is a far more effective safety valve for urban pressures than drinking two martinis or yelling at a runaway taxi driver. Even before the curtain goes up, Mr. Irwin and Mr. Shiner give us a taste of exactly what can go wrong in a typical night at the theater: Mr. Shiner, by impersonating an obstreperous late arrival who can't find his seat, and Mr. Irwin, by portraying a would-be emcee vanquished by a recalcitrant microphone wire before he can speak a word. Frustration, it becomes clear, is what this production is really about.   For the rest of the performance, with the gleefully eclectic musical accompaniment of the Red Clay Ramblers, Mr. Irwin and Mr. Shiner -- who play off each other in a good-clown, bad-clown tandem -- sustain a highly cathartic interpretation of life as an eternal wrestling match. Car doors, plates of spaghetti, cigarettes and even the performers' own intractable limbs are autonomous forces with daunting powers of their own. Sound familiar?
