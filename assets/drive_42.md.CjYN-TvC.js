The sexiness comes from the busy, desperate need-to-impress heat of a flirtation, an unrequited love communicated through a filter of sleep deprivation. &quot;Translation&quot; is also one of the purest and simplest examples ever of a director's falling in love with her star's gifts. And never has a director found a figure more deserving of her admiration than Bill Murray. He plays a vodka-and-bitters version of himself, and the persona that made him famous. His character, Bob, is an American movie star who's in Tokyo to participate in the celebrity not-so-secret shame: picking up a boatload of dough to appear in commercials for Suntory whiskey. While blinking sleeplessly around the hotel lobby of the majestically hermetic Tokyo Hyatt, he meets Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson), who has been abandoned by her husband, an ambitious photographer; he's off shooting a band. The movie follows the twists and connections in Bob and Charlotte's relationship; like some trans-Atlantic phone calls, their feelings reach each other on a five-second delay. The lag time only adds to the comedy, and heartbreak. — Elvis Mitchell An American in Japan, Making a Connection"},{"year":"1963","title":"Argentina POLITICS NO BAR TO ARGENTINIAN VISIT","excerpt":"Brief Encounters Time Out for Polo To the Interior By Train to the Coast Mr. Barnes Is Scared Colorful Area"},{"year":"2006","title":"During current Whitney Museum Biennial, performance artist Momus strolls galleries, calling himself the Unreliable Tour Guide and providing misinformation about art works","excerpt":"brief excerpts from commentary by Whitney and by Momus;

In portraying screen villains, Robert Cain has had his full share of adventures, but it is perhaps the first time that he has been felled by a woman's left jab and right hook for merely trying to steal a kiss. And before this happened, Mr. Cain, as the swindler's confederate, looked upon Juneau's little white knuckles as being very dainty.Although Juneau and her father, Kadiak MacLean, seem very ignorant of new inventions and transit systems, they serve to make this story highly entertaining. The picture is equipped with a splendid cast and so far as it is perceptible not a false move is made by any of the players. The inimitable Chester Conklin keeps the fun at a nice temperature throughout this comedy, the tale of which deals with a successful gold-miner and his daughter coming to New York and falling into the hands of swindlers. After weighing the incidents of this yarn, one rather thinks that the swindlers fell into the hands of the gold-miner and his daughter.Mr. Conklin takes care of the part of Juneau's father. When the crooks hope to ease his money away from him by keeping his glass full, he shows not the least hesitation in drinking nor does he betray any ill effects. Ha refused to get flushed or unsteady, which, to the swindlers, is something uncanny.One of the merriest scenes in this production is where the MacLeans arrive at the Grand Central, followed by the swindlers they had encountered on the train. MacLean signals a taxicab to go to the Biltmore Hotel, and the driver senses that they are strangers. He takes them first up to Grant's Tomb and then turns south. Then comes a glimpse of the swindlers, the older one saying to the man who poses as his son:\\"I thought you said they were going to the Biltmore, not Baltimore.\\"Apparently the only hitch to old MacLean's buying the subway from the swindlers is that he refuses to believe that it runs under water. He is somewhat fascinated by a model that is shown to him by the crooks, and he is also much impressed by the business done at one of the stations.Mr. MacLean carries his own money around in a roll so huge that it makes even wealth uncomfortable. When MacLean and his daughter reach New York, their clothes, like their ideas, are behind the times. Soon, however, a beauty parlor and a dressmaker work wonders with Juneau, and in time MacLean's only shortcoming in evening dress is that he finds a silk hat a nuisance because it comes too close to his forehead.This is a decidedly clever comedy, an agreeable disappointment considering that the title leads one to suppose that it is a chronicle of the wide open spaces, with frowning faces. Aileen Pringle gives a capital performance as Juneau. Burr McIntosh helps things along with his expressive countenance and Lowell Sherman officiates as the smooth young man who wins the girl. Henry Vibart is splendid as one of the swindlers.
