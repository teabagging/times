Now Kerry McDermott is a violinist in the New York Philharmonic and Anne-Marie McDermott and Maureen McDermott are occasionally heard as piano and cello recitalists, respectively. They have also kept the family trio going, and on Wednesday evening they played works by Schumann, Shostakovich and Mendelssohn at the 92d Street Y.     To say the McDermotts are energetic players is to understate the case. In Mendelssohn's Trio No. 2 in C minor (Op. 66), they played the opening movement's final pages with such fire and passion that one wondered if they would be able to summon those qualities in the greater measure required by the work's finale.     But evidently they had kept some power in reserve. After a warm, nostalgic reading of the Andante espressivo and an account of the Scherzo that was both fleet and precise, they played the closing Allegro appassionato with a galvanizing drive and an enormous, rich sound.   The Shostakovich Trio No. 2 in E minor (Op. 67) shared the forcefulness of the Mendelssohn performance. But the work, composed in 1944, is far removed from the Romantic ardor of Mendelssohn's time, and from a late-20th-century listener's perspective it is of greater emotional substance. The McDermotts played it hauntingly and aggressively, and did a fine job of turning its bitter, icy currents into a scorching, urgent cry.    The program also included Schumann's \\"Fantasiestucke\\" (Op. 88), a rarely heard, modest trio.

Cable television, on the other hand, is doing fine.    And these trends are not good for New York City.    The three big television networks have always had their headquarters in Manhattan. Last year ABC, CBS and NBC employed about 12,000 people in New York and generated a total of $10.8 billion in corporate revenues.    The cable industry, by contrast, has important power bases in Denver, the home of the largest cable operator, Tele-Communications Inc., and in Atlanta, the home of Ted Turner's cable empire, though several important cable channels, including HBO and MTV, are based in New York City.   Network revenues grew by only 2.5 percent last year from 1988. That was less than half the annual growth rate of 5.7 percent from 1985 to 1989, according to the investment firm of Veronis, Suhler & Associates.   Some additional growth is expected this year, but several analysts predict a flat year at best in 1991. The following year, with the Olympics and a Presidential election, could bring a revival of advertising, they say.    \\"We are surely in a trough for the network business,\\" said John Reidy, an analyst for Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company. Problems for Publications    The same advertising weakness is also affecting magazines and newspapers, which employ about 41,000 people in New York.    Several leading magazine publishers are based in New York, including the Time Inc. Magazine Company, Conde Nast and Hearst. In addition, The New York Times Company and Dow Jones & Company are based in Manhattan. All have been hurt by the advertising slump.   As a result, layoffs in the media industry seem to be likely. Mr. Reidy said layoffs were the only effective way to cut costs. But because the industry is so visible, he said, layoffs can create unfavorable publicity and contribute to the advertising slowdown.   Mitchell Moss, the director of the Urban Research Center at New York University, said he thought the television networks could recover by becoming \\"idea exporters.\\"    \\"What we do best here in New York is create ideas that are made into media products,\\" he said. \\"The networks ought to be able to make television a global export.\\" New York City Is Hurt But Still Has Reserves","excerpt":"The Media: Growing Trouble For the Networks"},{"year":"2010","title":"Business thrives for private security guards in Juarez, Mexico","excerpt":"The media's coverage of WikiLeaks shifts in tone; and a behind-the-scenes look at a special Oscar issue of the Times Magazine.

Neither did most of the 3,400 students at four inner-city Baltimore schools described in a new study for the Alan Guttmacher Institute. Like the kids at Jacob Riis, they are poor, live in projects and take early sex for granted. Of the girls in the seventh and eighth grades, 47 percent were sexually active. So were 92 percent of the boys in ninth grade. Eventually, however, the study found, the pregnancy rate at one pair of schools dropped by 30 percent while at the other pair it increased 58 percent. What explained the difference?  The students among whom pregnancy declined participated in an intensive prevention program designed and staffed by the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. At the other schools, used as a control group, students got only the sex education courses required by the state of Maryland. The special program ran for nearly three years. It brought a social worker and nurse into each school to provide individual and group counseling. It also provided medical and contraceptive services at two clinics nearby.

As rock moved back to the dance floor in the 1980's, the Australian band INXS (pronounced \\"in excess\\") emerged triumphant. With an array of solid, mostly borrowed riffs backing a singer, Michael Hutchence, who draws screams from teen-age girls, INXS has been selling millions of albums since the mid-1980's. At Madison Square Garden on Saturday night, young girls were dancing as they squealed.    INXS is a single-minded, efficient band. It has three kinds of songs: power-chord stomps recalling the Rolling Stones and Billy Idol, funk by way of Prince and piano-centered marches that echo Roxy Music, all braced by Jon Farriss's authoritative drumming. The lyrics, sung by Mr. Hutchence in a voice that can sound like Bryan Ferry or Elton John, are terse, rarely using more than five words per line","excerpt":"the melodies are often two- or three-note chants.

More than the fans of Pagnol's old films and of their heroic star, the great Raimu, were looking askance at the project. The fans of the musical were, too.But now the task is completed and the uncertainty resolved with the opening of the English-dialogue picture at the Music Hall yesterday. Whether fan of the Pagnol films or stage show, whether partial to music or no, you can't help but derive joy from this picture if you have a sense of humor and a heart.For Mr. Logan, with the aid of expert craftsmen and a cast of principals that we do not believe an act of divine cooperation could have greatly improved upon, has given the charming Marseilles folk play a stunning pictorial sweep, a deliciously atmospheric flavor and a flesh-touching intimacy. And, embraced by these graphic, sensuous virtues are the rich human, comic elements that flowed out of Pagnol's little pictures and glimmered upon the Broadway stage.Oh, don't begin to think Charles Boyer as the waterfront bar proprietor even tries to duplicate the Provence rumblings of the massive Raimu in the role, any more than he tries to sing the numbers that Ezio Pinza sang on the stage. (Nobody sings in this picture","excerpt":"the melodious Harold Rome score of the musical \\"Fanny\\" is effectively used as background music in the appropriate places, and that is all.)Neither does droll Maurice Chevalier even slightly imitate Charpin, the fine French actor who played the round sailmaker in the Pagnol films, or Walter Slezak, who played him Germanically on the Broadway stage.That is a beauty of this picture. It is a fresh and sparkling correlation of a group of superbly portrayed people who are individuals in themselves. Mr. Boyer is a raffish, cunning César, but he is also a bit subdued in the face of the jovial, dominating Panisse of Mr. Chevalier. At the same time, Mr. Boyer is full of tenderness and quiet sympathy as the father of the wanderlusting Marius who loves and leaves Fanny to go to sea, and Mr. Chevalier is wonderfully gentle when it comes to wooing and marrying the pregnant girl.Together these two magnificent acotrs develop a lovely, subtle sense of the unity of two old codgers in their understanding of the miracle of love, the vagaries of passion and the satisfaction of being parent to a son.As the girl, Fanny, Leslie Caron is lithe and luminous, expressive of all the inner yearnings and inborn patience of a gentle, sensitive girl. Her performance of the little dockside maiden who becomes a mother fast is by far the fullest and most emotional of any that we have seen. Horst Buchholz is bluntly boyish and intense as the troubled Marius, and Georgette Anys is hugely maternal and amusing as Fanny's fishmongering mama.Baccaloni as the portly ferry captain, Raymond Bussieres as the mooncalf Admiral and Lionel Jeffries as a prissy cafe patron do well in their character roles.To be sure, there are flaws in the compound. The cutting is often too abrupt, some scenes are confused by intercutting, and the tempo in the early phases is much too fast. Also, occasionally the actors are costumed too prettily, and the domestic magnificence of the Panisses in the last part is tasteless and absurd. Indeed, the bourgeois removal from their native waterfront and their priggish son, played by Joel Flateau, are two very bad distractions in the film.But the right mood is ultimately recovered with the tear-pulling death of Panisse and, on the whole, the appropriate atmosphere of Marseilles is literally and colorfully conveyed—in excellent color, by the way.Perhaps there will be some prim objection to the lush emotionalism of it all and to the frankness of the musical nudging, but we loved it. We loved it all—except for that big house in the suburbs. It made us feel sad and full of joy.Featured in the \\"Festival Time\\" stage show at the Music Hall is the Centenary College Choir of Shreveport, La., a group of twenty-eight mixed voices, led by Dr. A. C. Voran. Also in the show are Morgens Ellengaard, accordionist; the Charlivels, comedians; Alan Cole, impressionist, and the Corps de Ballet and Rockettes.

In addition, the film's preoccupation with a kind of doomy, unfulfilling heterosexuality, with lesbianism as the alternative, recalls the bogus breakthroughs made by some European film makers in the late 60's, when censorship boards everywhere began to crack.The film, however, is typical of those of the later period of Miss Seberg's life abroad. The settings and costumes mean to be chic","excerpt":"the melodrama is absurd, and Miss Seberg, her beauty unimpaired, gives an extremely sincere performance that is never particularly convincing. Once again, though, she gives dimension to a film of no great interest just because her presence is so unexpected. What, one keeps wondering, is this quintessentially American beauty, a woman who speaks in the flat accents of her native Iowa, doing in the middle of so much quintessential European decadence?We never do find out.In \\"The Corruption of Chris Miller\\" Miss Seberg plays Ruth, a successful London fashion designer spending the summer at her country villa in Spain with her equally beautiful, neurotic, teen-age stepdaughter, Chris (Marisol).Before I go further I have to explain that \\"The Corruption of Chris Miller\\" is the kind of movie in which a couple of very important things have happened before the start of the story — events whose revelation in the course of the film are entirely arbitrary: Ruth has been abandoned by Chris's father just one year before and (no connection here) Chris had been brutally raped in the shower of her dance school by a large hairy man.As the movie begins, it's apparent that the two women are spending a very edgy time together. Chris hates Ruth and yet she seems to respond to her stepmother's love, which is somewhat more than a mother's. Into this situation, already fairly fraught with problems, comes a handsome young Englishman named Barney (Barry Stokes), a drifter who studies anthropology because, as he says, human beings interest him. As Barry sets about becoming the love object of each woman (at different times), the countryside where they live is terrorized by a series of murders. Could Barry be the hatchet-person? Could Chris? Ruth?A director less greedy and more gifted than Mr. Bardem would have thrown out one-half of the screenplay and concentrated on the other half, developing either the relationship between the two women or the more sensational aspects of the murder mystery. As it is, there's more going on than Mr. Bardem can make cinematic sense of.It's quite possible, of course, that Mr. Bardem is saying something obliquely trenchant here about Spanish society under Franco, but to the rest of us \\"The Corruption of Chris Miller,\\" once titled \\"Behind the Shutters,\\" looks more like a multinational co-production that doesn't work.

The last three winners of the Heisman Trophy for outstanding college football player -- Barry Sanders, Andre Ware and Ty Detmer -- were juniors in college. Has a sophomore ever won it?    A.  No, but three players finished next in line as sophomores and all three won the Heisman in subsequent years, one as a junior. The first of this kind was Angelo Bertelli of Notre Dame, who finished second to Bruce Smith of Minnesota in the 1941 voting, was sixth as a junior and then won as a senior in 1943. A year later, Glenn Davis, a sophomore at Army, was runner-up to Les Horvath of Ohio State, losing by 125 points, the closest a sophomore has come to winning the Heisman. Davis was runner-up again as a junior, this time to his Army teammate, Doc Blanchard, before running off with the trophy as a senior in 1946.    Herschel Walker also belongs in this Heisman threesome and a case can be made for O. J. Simpson, too. As a freshman at Georgia in 1980, Walker finished third, behind George Rogers of South Carolina and Hugh Green of Pitt. As a sophomore, Walker was second to Marcus Allen of Southern Cal. As a junior, Walker beat out John Elway of Stanford for the Heisman, then beat a path to the pros after only three seasons of college ball.   Simpson played only two seasons for Southern Cal after spending his freshman and sophomore years in junior college. In 1968, Simpson, a junior in his first year at a major college, finished second in the Heisman voting to Gary Beban of U.C.L.A. The following year, as usual, no one could catch him. Everyone's All-American    Q. How does a college football player become a so-called consensus all-American?    A. Basically, he's the one who finishes first the most times at his position in the voting of all-America teams by five organizations at the end of the season. The group consists of the two news agencies, The Associated Press and United Press, which poll their staff members and clients","excerpt":"the members of the Football Writers Association of America and the American Football Coaches Association, and the Walter Camp Foundation, whose founder was the one who started all this all-America business more than 100 years ago. A Punted Kickoff     Q. Suppose the Giants are trailing the 49ers by 4 points in the closing minutes and their quarterback, Phil Simms, unable to elude a pass rush in the end zone, is tackled for a 2-point safety. Now trailing by 6 points, the Giants are desperate to gain possession, but they must kick the ball to San Francisco from their 20-yard line. If the punter, Sean Landeta, kicks it high enough so that Mark Bavaro, a tight end installed on the special-teams' unit for this play, is able to outleap and outmuscle the receiving 49ers and catch the ball on the 30, would the Giants get to keep the ball?    A.  It's first-and-10, Giants, in this situation. Although the free kick required after a safety resembles a punt in form, it falls under the rules of a kickoff, which means the kicking team can recover the ball so long as it travels at least 10 yards. That would not be true for a punt, where the receiving team has first crack at the ball. One way the 49ers could counter the move, assure San Francisco possession and have the Giants kicking themselves instead of kicking to themselves, would be to have a player call for a fair catch -- and make it. N.L. Pitcher at Bat     Q. An answer last week established that Walter Johnson's .433 batting average for the Washington Senators in 1925 was the highest one-season average for a pitcher. That's surely a major league and American League record, but what's the National League mark for a season?    A.  Although Curt Davis batted .381 for the St. Louis Cardinals in 1938, Don Newcombe hit .359 for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1955 and Johnny Sain batted .346 for the Boston Braves in 1947, no National League pitcher with 75 or more times at bat ever had a better season taking his cuts than Jack Bentley had with the New York Giants in 1923. On a John McGraw team that won its third of four straight pennants, Bentley managed 38 hits in 89 times up for a striking .427 mark that included a 10-for-20 .500 showing as a pinch hitter. Bentley, a left-hander all the way who won 13 games and lost 8 in 1923, even went 3 for 5 in the World Series against the Yankees that fall, coming through twice as a pinch-hitter.    Q. Regarding pitchers as hitters: How good was Babe Ruth?   A. Ruth was not as good a hitter when pitching as he turned out to be when playing the outfield, more like a nuisance than a terror, but he sure wasn't an easy out either way. In the 208 games in which Ruth was a pitcher or pinch-hitter, a role he sometimes filled on days when he was not on the mound, Ruth had a .304 batting average with 149 hits in 490 official times at bat. Among the hits were 34 doubles, 11 triples and 15 of Ruth's specialty, the home run. He even had one grand slam and he drove in 73 runs.    For his major league career, which was sowed as a pitcher in Boston with the Red Sox in 1914, ripened into slugging stardom as a Yankee outfielder from 1920-34 and withered quickly back in Boston with the Braves in 1935, Ruth batted .342 with 714 home runs.

In December 1978, Vietnam, which from April 1970 until April 1977 had provided crucial military and propaganda support for Pol Pot, again invaded Cambodia. Under the pretext of ''saving the Khmer people from genocide,'' the Vietnamese overthrew their disobedient former comrades and installed a puppet regime.  Intransigent in its colonial aspirations, Soviet-backed Vietnam ignored the United Nations's repeated calls to withdraw. Instead, its troops tried mass starvation (which killed 700,000 civilians in 1979) and biochemical warfare in order to crush resistance. These policies have failed.\\n\\nToday, arrayed against 180,000 Vietnamese troops is a loose coalition of resistance forces.

The second component is the 9,000-man Khmer People's National Liberation Front, led by Prince Sihanouk's former Prime Minister, Son Sann. It is a pro-Western nationalist force, skimpily aided by individual members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or Asean.

She was born in September 1991, a daughter of the Tonga tribe, and now -- and until she reaches her fifth birthday or dies -- she is eligible, through a joint emergency Save the Children and Zimbabwean Government feeding program, to receive one meal of corn mush a day. Even so, she hasn't gained any weight since April.\\n\\nSometimes when she's able, her mother, Angeline, who cares for four other children -- two of whose parents died of AIDS -- varies the diet with a wild fruit she must gather, cook, peel and cook again with ashes, to neutralize its natural poison.\\n\\n\\"Is it good?\\" I ask her in the way of ordinary conversation.\\n\\nAngeline looks at me as if we have experienced a language problem. \\"It's \\n\\nfood\\n\\n,\\" she corrects. \\n\\nMost adult Zimbabweans, unlike their counterparts in Ethiopia, the Sudan or Somalia, have never before had to worry about basic sustenance. Their 13-year-old country normally exports grain, and in and around Harare, the capital, the aquifer-fed sprinklers still keep golf courses and lawns green. The prosperous city looks like the rest of Zimbabwe before the rains stopped coming in February, before this year's agricultural crop failed, before the river beds turned to dust. For those who still manage to live as they used to, depleting, in the process the finite underground water, the imminent prospect of famine seems the stuff of someone else's very bad dream.\\n\\nAnd yet by most estimates Southern Africa has an immediate and desperate need to import five times the tonnage of food that the nations of the Horn required during the worst hungry years of the 1980's.\\n\\nWhen Disaster -- whose name was chosen not for its meaning but because it sounds exotic -- grows up, she'll spend most of her time walking the eight miles to the shallow well near the river where she'll compete with impala and elephants for water. She'll try to catch five gallons, lug it home and return again to the muddy hole -- hoping not to meet a starving lion like the one that killed a cousin, implicitly trusting, because she has no choice, that the silty, loamy soil will act as an effective filter against typhoid bacteria.\\n\\nIf she takes after her mother, Disaster will be beautiful, smiling, shy and strong. She'll own one dress at a time and no shoes. She'll curtsy to strangers and live in a society of women","excerpt":"the men are mostly off at commercial fishing companies or the mines. Her homeland to the north was flooded to make a dam, and now she dwells in a dusty lower veldt, a place where the January summer temperatures can reach 120 degrees and where, in winter, the skies fill with the smoke of slash-and-burn fires.\\n\\nSeveral hundred miles to the south, in Mutema, water is the chief concern of a pump minder, Jonathan Bhizeki. Only five of the 35 deep wells and one of the 14 bore holes for which he bears responsibility have water, and they are rapidly becoming exhausted. For the 12,000 people in and around this plateau, it has been a calamitous year. Not a single crop could be harvested, there is no food in the shops and no rain is expected until November. Handsome and distracted, Jonathan Bhizeki looks almost embarrassed, as if the sky's failure were his own.\\n\\nDressed formally, as befits his position, in a tan tie beneath a maroon and white argyle sweater, Clever Gwenzi, principal of the local elementary school, is not hopeful. Even his father, born fewer than 15 miles away, has never seen such a drought. Children are fainting in the classrooms from lack of food. And it would cost an impossible 700 Zimbabwe dollars (about $140) to provide healthy lunches to the 423 students each week. If the well that serves the community clinic and the school -- in addition to much of the area's population -- fails, everything will close down.\\n\\nIn the dazzling African sunset, aridity is invisible. Stark white buildings stand in relief against a red-orange, cloudless sky, and not even the sound of birds intrudes on the silence. There's a dying tree in the center of a circle of stones, a gesture toward landscaping. I ask the species, but no one knows. It's not indigenous.\\n\\n\\"I had a farm in Africa,\\" Gerry Salole, my host -- who is also Save the Children's regional director -- quotes from Isak Dinesen. I understand the literary allusion. Indeed, the romantic European view of Africa is gentler than the parched bed of the nearby Sabe River, marred with animal carcasses.\\n\\nOne of the worries of emergency relief workers is that Zimbabweans are not psychologically prepared for catastrophe. The country, which was formerly the British colony of Southern Rhodesia, has had a healthy, varied economy, and so the population is schooled in optimism. \\"Rain will no doubt come,\\" I was told again and again by urban and rural people. \\"It always has. It must.\\"\\n\\nBut, according to meteorologists, it won't, barring a miracle. And even with ideal weather, no crops will be ready for harvest before late May. In the interim there are several crucial needs, none of them impossible to meet. Existing wells must be deepened, at an average cost of $600 each. (New dug wells cost $3,000.) Trucks to transport the emergency food supplies en route must be leased or bought.\\n\\nPhilanthropic and supplementary feeding programs now in place must be sustained at current levels, despite the decline in contributions experienced by many international charities -- often attributed to a malaise on the part of the fortunate known as \\"famine fatigue.\\" Enough goats and cattle need to be kept alive through the next six months to form the core of communal livestock herds.\\n\\nThese things are, in fact, matters of life and death. The longer-term social issues -- the minimum monthly wage in Zimbabwe is roughly equivalent to the cost of 10 Wimpie double cheeseburgers (about $30); the residual \\"racialism,\\" as it's locally termed; the fact that most of the affluent believe they must hire a poor man to stand outside their homes all night to deter intruders -- will have to wait. In the advent of a disaster, complication is a luxury necessarily deferred.\\n\\nZimbabwe, after all, even with about half of its population in need of food assistance, is the success story of a region that includes Mozambique, Angola, Malawi and Zambia -- all far worse off in one way or another. Zimbabwe has the political infrastructure, the good roads, the system of dependable communications to be stable -- but not if it must impoverish itself in order to merely survive, not if it must buy food with money slated for economic development.\\n\\nThere are 641 foreign non-governmental organizations registered in Zimbabwe. Some, like CARE, Save the Children, the Red Cross and Africair, are working directly to mitigate the suffering caused by the drought, but they depend upon philanthropy and that, in turn, depends on sustained human empathy, even over long distances, even with the repetition of demand. If the font of global generosity dries up, along with the water, Southern Africa will face a food and water crisis of truly enormous proportions.\\n\\nDisaster, Angeline's daughter, needs a response, and she needs it before her stomach swells with hunger, before pellagra sets in, before her shallow bowl is completely empty. When it doesn't rain, she simply needs a deeper well.

For the last few years, New York's best place for musical hot fun in the summertime has been the Summerstage series at Rumsey Playfield behind the Band Shell in Central Park at 70th Street - free outdoor concerts by some of the world's most exuberant bands, drawing some of the city's most variegated crowds to a place where there's plenty of room to stand up and shimmy under the stars (or streetlights).

Mr. Faggioni, quite literally, frames the work in Zeffirellian grandiosity, with green marble side columns supporting a segment of ceiling near the front of the stage. Obviously part of Gustav's palace, the work's basic setting, this false proscenium sits oddly on Anckarstrom's mansion, to say nothing of the forlorn rocky gorge.

The main offerings were two turn-of-the-century tone poems, Strauss's \\"Death and Transfiguration\\" and \\"La Mer,\\" by Debussy. But surely the lure for many ticket buyers was the mezzo-soprano Cecilia Bartoli, who performed at the start of the program and just after intermission.

Looking back at the seven-month 1981-82 schedule, which concluded with last night's performance of ''Fidelio,'' we find those two painful but useful words cropping up again and again.  Consider, as the season in microcosm, that famous opening night when boos greeted Renata Scotto before she could sing a note of her opening aria, ''Casta diva.'' That lack of elementary fair play ranked as one of the season's low points, particularly since not only Miss Scotto but the conductor and the other two principal singers were appearing in their roles for the first time with the Metropolitan. Yes, but ...when all that is taken into account the fact remains that Miss Scotto went on to sing poorly in a punishing role that she should not have been allowed to attempt at this stage of her career. Critical chivalry, sadly, must in this instance bow to reality.   Or think of the new production of ''La Boheme,'' whose opulent designs and manic staging aroused audiences to frenzies of appreciation. Yes, but can you recall without looking it up who sang the principal roles in that Franco Zeffirelli extravaganza?

Richard Wagner's last opera, written in 1882, a year before he died, was first done at the Met in 1903, to the consternation of many Wagner disciples. They argued, quite correctly, that the composer had stipulated that this particular work be performed only in his own theater at Bayreuth. The Met won out and, perhaps in atonement for what some called sacrilege, made \\"Parsifal\\" an Eastertime tradition.    This particular production, conceived by Otto Schenk, was first staged at the Met in March 1991, and runs for four and a half hours. Taped last year, it will be broadcast tonight on Channel 13 at 8 P.M., with a stereo simulcast on WQXR-FM (96.3).

Puccini thought it \\"the best of my operas,\\" adapting it from the play by David Belasco (who also provided the composer with Madama Butterfly & Company), but that turned out to be a minority opinion. The opera's lyricism was deliberately embedded in the midst of continuous development, not providing the framed melodic hits expected from Puccini. So \\"La Girl,\\" as he called it, languished.   But as Thursday's performance showed, the work deserves a more favored place in the repertory. We may have to tolerate the notion of Wild West gold miners singing in Italian (except for a few choice words like \\"hello,\\" \\"dooda, dooda day\\" and \\"whisky\\"), and we may have to resign ourselves to hearing American frontiersmen singing Puccini melodies redolent of Debussy and Strauss. We may even have to accept the notion that a poker game would be played for custody of a man bleeding profusely from a bullet wound.

His father, a Nez Perce, was uncomfortable with his heritage; his white mother loved \\"Gunsmoke\\" because \\"it was a West without Indians and thus a West without my father.\\" Mr. Penn, who teaches English at Michigan State University and has written a novel, \\"The Absence of Angels,\\" tries to provide a context for his book by analyzing the first novels in English by Indian writers; this section is too long, heavy with academic jargon and repetitious (a flaw found elsewhere in the book). \\"All My Sins Are Relatives\\" is worth the trouble for its pointed and funny observations on topics like drumming weekends and other imitations of Indian culture and for its discussion of Western grammar, which the author thinks is unnecessary for authentic storytelling. Mr. Penn maintains that the cardinal rule of writing -- be specific -- falls flat in the oral tradition. Ironically, it is the precision of his language and his finely drawn portraits that are the strengths of his book.

A decade has passed since the last major show of her work in this country, the Guggenheim Museum's ''Eva Hesse: A Memorial Exhibition,'' in 1972-73, at a time when the mythicizing occasioned by Hesse's difficult life and early death was bound to affect perception of her work. As the critic Lucy Lippard notes in her compelling book on her friend, ''Eva Hesse'' (New York University Press, 1976), for a while she became ''the art world's answer to Sylvia Plath and Diane Arbus,'' even though she was a fighter, not a suicide. Distance lends perspective, however, and now two current presentations, while not full retrospectives, allow another look at certain aspects of the work: ''Eva Hesse: The Drawings'' at New York University's Grey Art Gallery and Study Center, 33 Washington Place (through Feb. 19), and the related ''Eva Hesse: Paintings and Reliefs,'' at Metro Pictures, 169 Mercer Street (through Jan. 29), which handles the Hesse estate. Both shows reveal how Hesse, who for years misperceived herself as a painter, gradually worked her way into sculpture, her real metier. The Grey exhibition, organized by Ellen Johnson, honorary curator of modern art at the Allen Memorial Art Museum of Oberlin College, concentrates on drawings, with the addition by the Grey Gallery of six sculptural works","excerpt":"the Metro show zeros in on an important phase of her career, the transitional period from 1963 to 1966 when she moved from painting to wall reliefs.

The production ran for only 124 performances and lost its entire $70,000 investment.

Romão, an unemployed truck driver, has set his sights on an unrealistically high monthly salary that he imagines he can earn in the big city. What distinguishes the family's odyssey is that the trip, consuming several months, is made on four bicycles. Journeying into the unknown, the family fends for itself, taking odd jobs in this or that town, sleeping outdoors and begging for food when necessary.

Their hearts are in their work but they emerge as dispassionate research scientists rather than poets with stars in their eyes.Let there be no doubt that they are artists. Produced for about $65,000 over a period of approximately four years of week-ends, or whatever time was available for all concerned, \\"The Savage Eye\\" represents the efforts of a variety of professionals. Mr. Maddow has written the scripts for such noted films as \\"The Asphalt Jungle,\\" \\"Intruder in the Dust\\" and \\"The Unforgiven.\\" Mr. Meyers has directed many documentaries and is known especially for his work on \\"The Quiet One.\\" And Mr. Strick has directed such caustic fact films as \\"Muscle Beach\\" and \\"The Big Break.\\"Their present view of life is focused on Los Angeles, to which our soul-tortured, mind-weary heroine has fled for surcease from an explosive end to more than nine years of marriage. Needless to say, this teeming cosmopolis is an iridescent mine of faces that obsessed both the aforementioned film makers and their many able photographers, including Helen Levitt, Jack Couffer, Haskell Wexler, Sy Wexler and Joel Coleman.This human panorama has stood them in good stead. The array not only points up their somber, Gothic tale but also gives it a large part of its basic drama. In the urgent, strained, stream-of-consciousness dialogue between the narrator (Gary Merrill), who is never seen, and our pained, groping heroine who is living on \\"bourbon, cottage cheese and alimony,\\" an observer is given a startling editorial on hopelessness that slowly evolves into a semblance of hope.She is a drifting type, who attempts a telephonic reconciliation with her former husband, learns that he is happy without her, and then wanders through a succession of empty diversions. The diversions include a liaison with a married man she loathes, vacuous nights and days in poker parlors, strip-tease joints and, finally, a blatantly crass faith healer's congregation that drives her away from this \\"nothingness\\" in a wild ride that ends in a near-fatal automobile accident. But, in recuperating from her injuries, she begins to have \\"the courage to say no to nothingness\\" and accepts a positive view on living.Barbara Baxley, as the strained, weary and confused lady of sorrows, is the center of attention. An actress who has seen service in \\"East of Eden,\\" the theatre and many television dramas, she speaks her lines in narration but not directly. She does so with enough restraint and sensitivity to register both the poignance and tragedy of her situation. Mr. Merrill's narration as her inquisitor and conscience is also quiet, but pointed. And, Herschel Bernardi, as Miss Baxley's lustful swain, is simply direct and obvious.However, it is from the photographic and sound-track concentration on the Hogarthian faces of Los Angeles that \\"The Savage Eye\\" derives most of its ferocity. The rabid wrestling-match audiences","excerpt":"the middle-aged and elderly ladies seeking improvement of gross bodies in beauty parlors; the sensuous writhings of Jean (Venus the Body) Hidey as she strips and teases in a burlesque joint, and, most effectively, the matter-of-fact faith healer who doles out wholesale blessings on the afflicted (done with a direct voice and sound track) are the most striking glints in \\"The Savage Eye.\\"The unloved who are the \\"heroes\\" of \\"The Savage Eye,\\" like its driven heroine, are seen coldly and scientifically but, sadly enough, without warmth.

Throughout the performance, his hands jerked, conducted, marked time, but always quivered with tension, reacting almost tactilely to the music. During the slow variations his head was just inches above his hands, as if he were watching his fingers pull threads through the eyes of minuscule needles, weaving a tensile web of contrapuntal lines.   \\"The Goldberg Variations\\" is an extraordinary film, revealing something about the musical interpretation by showing the struggles and ecstatic concentration of the man creating it (Gould's last, highly charged recording of the work is the film's soundtrack).

Neurotics repress intolerable desires and fears at the price of emotional disorder, and paranoiacs remain imprisoned by their false beliefs because they cannot see whatever disproves them. Yet healthy individuals, when things go wrong, preserve their self-esteem by seeing outside factors as chiefly responsible rather than focusing on their own shortcomings, and people who deal regularly with disease, suffering and death shut off their feelings in order to cope with experiences that might otherwise be overwhelming.

His excellent essay is one of 14 commentaries by artists, critics and collectors that complement the 82-year-old French-born artist's work in LOUISE BOURGEOIS: The Locus of Memory.  Works 1982-1993 (Brooklyn Museum/Abrams, $45). The subtly lighted photographs perfectly render Ms. Bourgeois's luscious yet disquieting forms -- for example,  an array of lotion-pink rubber breasts in \\"Mamelles\\" (1991) or the odd anemone-like colonies sprouting from sparkling marble in \\"Untitled (With Growth)\\" (1989). The artist's extraordinary new installations, the \\"Cell\\" series, are beautifully documented: cubicles of industrial metal fence, rusted and peeling, enclose uncanny assemblages of found objects and finished sculpture, as in \\"Cell (Choisy)\\" (1990-93), in which a small white marble version of Ms. Bourgeois's family house sits beneath a scale model of a guillotine.

A Brave New World is a novel about the struggle of Bernard Marx, who rejects the tenants of his society when he discovers that he is not truly happy. 1984 is the story of Winston who finds forbidden love within the hypocrisy of his society. In both cases, the main character is in quiet rebellion against his government which is eventually found to be in vain. … Since its publication in 1932, Brave New World and its author has been the subject of much commentary and much criticism. Many people consider this Huxley's most important work: many others think it is his only work. This novel has been praised and condemned, vilified and glorified, a source of controversy, a subject for sermons, and required reading for many high school students and college undergraduates. This novel has had twenty-seven printings in the United States alone and will probably have twenty-seven more.… Brave New World is a masterpiece of science fiction. Huxley has imaginatively employed scientific facts and theories to produce a classic of its kind. This novel is in the tradition of Jules Verne, the French novelist who wrote Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea and Journey to the Center of the Earth, and H. G. Wells, the English novelist who wrote War of the Worlds. Few writers of science fiction have equaled Huxley's ability to make the unbelievable seem believable and to make the improbable seem probable. His own interest in science, its use and misuse, its peril and its promise, contributed to the accuracy of his presentation and to the horror of his envisioned Utopia. … In A Brave New World history is ignored completely whereas in 1984 it is literally rewritten in order to suit the present. The role of science in both books is extensive and complicated. 1984's telescreens cannot be turned off, as A Brave New World has \\"feelies,\\" an advancement on \\"talkies\\" which added sound, \\"feelies\\" add tactile senses to a movie as well. Science and human progress is not acknowledged in A Brave New World (Smith) excepting when it increases consumption, whereas it is twisted with ironic titles in 1984, \\"They were homes of the four Ministries between which the entire apparatus of government was divided: the Ministry of Truth, which concerned itself with news, entertainment, education, and the fine arts","excerpt":"the Ministry of Peace, which concerned itself with war; the Ministry of Love, which maintained law and order; and the Ministry of Plenty, which was responsible for economic affairs. Their names in Newspeak: Minitrue, Minipax, Miniluv, and Miniplenty.\\" … Orwell is considered a failed prophet and both he and \\"1984\\" remain as enigmatic and controversial as ever. A man of contradictions, Orwell chose to live in near poverty for most of his life despite being educated in some of England's finest schools. He hated authority, yet spent five years as an officer with the Indian Imperial Police in Burma. He was an avowed socialist who nonetheless despised communism. Many of his writings were openly racist and anti-semetic, yet he campaigned tirelessly to improve life for lower-class people. And despite his apparent disdain for organized religion, he asked for and received a funeral and burial in the Church of England. Both Orwell, whose real name was Eric Arthur Blair, and \\"1984\\" are misunderstood to this day.… Both books forewarn of a day when humankind might fall slave to its own concept of how others should act. The two books ask not whether societies with stability, pacification, and uniformity can be created, but whether or not they are worth creating. It is so often that one wants something and in wanting romanticizes it, thus bringing disappointment when the end is finally obtained. They serve as a reminder that it is necessary to have pain to compare with joy, defeat to compare with victory, and problems in order to have solutions.

In the debates and elsewhere, President Bush repeatedly said that the misery index was down considerably from the Carter years. The country didn't buy it. \\n\\nMr. Bush's use of the misery index reflected the almost exclusive focus of economic policy in the 1980's on growth and price stability. There is no doubt that the rate of economic growth and the rate of inflation are two important criteria for judging the success of any economic policy. But a full evaluation of economic performance must also include measures of distributive justice. That is, how equitably the nation's overall gains are allocated. If a strong overall economy does not improve economic conditions for most people, especially the poor, or if economic gains are not fairly distributed, then any claims of overall prosperity ring hollow.

John Ford, who won the last Photoplay Magazine gold medal award with his \\"Four Sons,\\" is responsible for the able direction of this current offering, which is blessed with clever acting, keen humor and a minimum of stereotyped stuff.Although it is very different from the original work, Mr. Clarke can at least feel that his story inspired the producers to make a thoroughly entertaining film. Edmund Lowe impersonates the redoubtable Beretti so capably that his few good deeds outshine his nefarious activities. This Beretti treats chances for a \\"rap\\" philosophically and even slightly. He is, however, more than slightly relieved when, the District Attorney gives him and two others a chance to redeem themselves by going to fight in France instead of being incarcerated.Prior to crossing the ocean Louis and the others have their clashes with sergeants and officers. When he is asked for \\"his line\\" Beretti ventures that he is a jeweler. Another man says that he is a ball player. A third hazards that his daily toil is that of an ice man. A rich young man says that he does not do anything but go to college, and a none-too-good-looking individual volunteers that he is a burglar, which is understood as a \\"bugler.\\"Beretti, not recognizing a General, in one scene asks the high officer for a light and addresses him as \\"Doc.\\" Later in France, when he is flirting with a pretty French girl, he says \\"Sherman was wrong.\\" The attractive wench says \\"Cheri,\\" and Beretti, evidently believing that she meant \\"share it\\" (some sugar), offers to do so immediately. He is a hero on the battlefield and a bad man at home. He looks upon \\"old John Law\\" as pretty hard to beat.One of the many laughable incidents in this film is where Charles Banks, who has proposed to Beretti's sister, is introduced to Louis's gang. They do not hesitate to make comments on the young man, and one of them calls him \\"Four Eyes.\\" The harmless fellow with spectacles resents this, and as he passes through the door with Beretti he is heard saying that he dislikes being referred to as \\"Four Eyes.\\" Little does he know of the type of men he has just encountered.Like in George Bancroft's last picture, \\"Ladies Love Brutes,\\" there is a kidnapping, but in this case it is more plausible than in the Bancroft film. Beretti hears from Joan, the sister of Frank Sheldon, his wealthy buddy who met death on the battlefield, that her child has been kidnapped. He suspects his gangster pal. Big Shot, of the crime, and after recovering the youngster, he takes the law in his own hands.Although this film is not weighty material, it makes a good entertainment. Catherine Dale Owen may not be a Duse when it comes to acting, but she is very attractive. Others who help out in this film are Lee Tracy, William Harrigan, Paul Page, Frank Albertson and Warren Hymer.There are several excellent stage numbers, including Beatrice Belkin in the aria from \\"The Star of the North,\\" the Roxyettes in \\"Putting on the Dog\\" and \\"A Russian Wedding.\\" THE SCREEN","excerpt":"The Missing Witness."},{"year":"1993","title":"To the Editor:   The three front-page photographs of fathers and daughters accompanying \\"For Girls, a Time to See the Workaday World\\" (April 29) ironically fail to capture the symbolism of the day.

Amazingly, what it also seems to be saying is that 40 years after John Ford's 1956 &quot;The Searchers,&quot; we've arrived at a point in film history in which the movie industry can only offer a less sophisticated version of the same material. Overly sensitive and disdainful of her tough life, Lilly (Evan Rachel Wood) longs to escape the grim cabin she shares with her healer mother, Maggie (Cate Blanchett), and little sister, Dot (Jenna Boyd). Lilly gets away from home in a way she never bargained for — she's kidnapped by a group of renegade Indians who plan to sell her once they cross the border into Mexico. Just before Lilly is snatched away, Maggie's estranged father (Tommy Lee Jones) returns home: there's already tension in the household. When the worst happens, Maggie is forced to team with her father to track down her daughter. But &quot;The Missing&quot; leaves out the sexual paranoia that John Wayne's face reflected; he was eaten alive by the possibility that his abducted niece had become sexually involved with her captors. Despite torrents of brutality, there's no danger of rape from the scrupulous villains in &quot;The Missing.&quot; As a result, this is a movie that only exists from the shoulders up. It's an intriguing way for Ron Howard to play to his chief strength — and interests — the knotty and peculiar emotional cross-currents that buffet a family. And  for a time, before it shifts into the thriller aspect of the story, &quot;The Missing&quot; feels like a thoughtful attempt to focus on the strains of home life.

The date assigned to Kawakubo for her show was, as it happened, the 50th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, and two critics saw in the striped pajamas a reminder of the Nazi death camps. Their outraged reviews, in Le Figaro and The International Herald Tribune, prompted a visit to the Comme des Garcons showroom by members of the European Jewish Congress and a spate of articles denouncing Kawakubo as, at best, an unwitting anti-Semite. As a gesture of conciliation, she withdrew the pajamas from the line. Other items in the collection had been stenciled with numerals, randomly scattered, and with footprints. As the scandal escalated, the pajamas came to be described as stamped with \\"identification numbers\\"","excerpt":"the models, as \\"emaciated,\\" with \\"shaved heads\\"; and the footprints, as made by military boots trampling the Jews underfoot.

Last month, the Mayor of the third arrondissement refused to rent Kawakubo her usual, city-owned space, for her women's show -- for fear of losing the Jewish vote in the coming elections.   For those of us in the audience that evening in January, the Holocaust connection was one of many possible interpretations, and a highly subjective one, at that.

The truth is, of course, a much clumsier contraption with lots of uncoordinated moving parts, something akin to a Rube Goldberg machine.   One need only walk through the Stuart Davis retrospective at the Metropolitan Museum of Art to know that Pollock and his Abstract Expressionist colleagues weren't alone in trying to translate European modernism into an authentically American art. Similarly, one can think back to the 40's paintings of Burgoyne Diller, highlighted in his retrospective at the Whitney Museum of American Art last year, and realize that the decade was full of artists hoping that history would anoint them for creating the \\"next thing\\" in modern art.    At the moment two related yet wildly dissimilar exhibitions shed more light on the diversity of 40's art. They also help elucidate some of the artistic issues that dominated the period. One show, \\"The Indian Space Painters\\" at Baruch College near Gramercy Park, is a well-researched excavation of a little-known group of artists whose pursuit of abstraction was as determined as the Abstract Expressionists', and a bit ahead of them, too.    The group included Will Barnet, now a figurative artist, as well as much less familiar names: Steve Wheeler, Robert Barrell, Peter Busa, Helen DeMott, Gertrude Barrer and Howard Daum, a Polish-born painter who gave the group its name in 1946. Their bright, often intricately patterned abstractions, which borrow equally from Cubism and Surrealism and from the animated, animal-based motifs of Northwest Coast Indian art, add a new chapter to the story of the art of the 1940's.    The other show, at the Michael Rosenfeld Gallery on West 57th Street, is a sketchy 25-year survey of the Neo-Romantic Surrealist Pavel Tchelitchew (1898-1957). This display of 29 works, mostly drawings from the late 1930's and 40's, constitutes the first New York exhibition of this artist since 1964. Master of a creepy-crawly fusion of figures and landscape forms, Tchelitchew relocated to New York in the mid-1930's after establishing himself in Paris. He was a gifted, if often reactionary, draftsman who took inspiration from the Renaissance, supported himself painting portraits and frequently designed ballet sets and costumes, sometimes for George Balanchine.    Today he is probably best known as the creator of \\"Hide and Seek,\\" a kitschy, hallucinatory mixture of children's heads and a gnarled tree that the Museum of Modern Art claims is the most popular painting in its collection. (It may qualify as the grandfather of the 60's drug poster.) But in the early 40's, Tchelitchew was one of the hottest artists on the New York scene","excerpt":"the Modern acquired \\"Hide and Seek\\" from him in 1942, the year it was completed, and a few months later gave him a full-scale retrospective.   Stylistically, these two shows go together not at all, and yet viewed in tandem, they provide a fresh sense of the artistic ideas or \\"issues\\" that were in the air in the 40's and of the ways different artists dealt with them. The main issue, visible in both shows, is the breakdown between figure and ground -- initially inspired by the automatic drawings of the Surrealists -- that melded positive form and negative space into a single, continuous \\"all over\\" image.   The Abstract Expressionists have traditionally been seen as the prime inventors of all-overness, with Pollock's 1947 drip abstractions marking the breakthrough. But at Baruch it's clear that the Indian Space Painters formulated their own integration of figure and ground in the early 40's. The most striking evidence is Wheeler's \\"Dancing Figure\\" of 1941, a colorful patchwork of interlocking shapes, and Barrell's \\"Hunters\\" of 1942, whose debt to Northwest Coast Indian art is so great that this delicate little painting reads as an act of devoted homage. (Barrell is also represented in the show by a painted wood bowl and carved totem in addtion to several paintings.)    The art of the Kwakiutl and Tlingit Indians of the Northwest Coast inspired these artists to create a kind of all-overness that was more geometric than the Abstract Expressionists and also more communicative, because it was sprinkled with signs of meaning: ideograms, symbols and suggestions of masks and figures. (The only Abstract Expressionist to use ideograms was Adolph Gottlieb.) It seems, for example, that every mark in Gertrude Barrer's swirling little images, \\"Untitled I\\" and \\"Untitled II\\" of 1946, is kind of a sign: a spiral, a hand, a tuft of grass, a duck's head. \\"Red Painting\\" by Helen Demott, whose sincere, tenderly done paintings may qualify as the show's most significant rediscovery, is a sequence of compartmentalized ideograms and hieroglyphs that has strong affinities with Gottlieb's paintings from the same period.    Strangely enough, Tchelitchew intermittently pursued his own idiosyncratic version of the figure-ground blend, without ever betraying his realist impulses. He had many stylistic irons in the fire, starting with a Constructivist-inspired abstraction titled \\"Three Eggs\\" from 1925. But his New York work shows an increasing instinct to blend natural and human forms into emotionally suggestive hybrids. This would culminate in \\"Hide and Seek,\\" several sketches for which are included in this exhibition, as well as more conventional works like \\"Interior Landscape,\\" in which a faintly Mannerist translucent head becomes the site of a vast interior space populated by a forest of branchlike veins.    It is doubtful that Tchelitchew will be rehabitiliated as a great or even a very good artist, although his polymorphous sense of style has many echoes among contemporary artists -- Sigmar Polke, for example. Nor is it likely that the re-emergence of the Indian Space Painters will much diminish the Abstract Expressionist achievement. Nonetheless, both exhibitions make Pollock and company seem less toweringly singular; they were far from alone in their endeavors and the more that is known about their contemporaries the better.     \\"The Indian Space Painters: Native American Sources for American Abstract Art\\" remains at the Sidney Mishkin Gallery, Baruch College, 135 East 22d Street, through Dec. 17. \\"Pa     vel Tchelitchew: Nature Within and Without,\\" remains at the Michael Ro     senfeld Gallery, 50 West 57th Street, through Jan. 25.

Rather there are in this remake of the famous John Balderston play, which Twentieth Century-Fox has put together in London's Denham studios, such stiff and materialistic aspects of ponderous crudity that all the fragile charm and wistful pathos of the original are crushed beneath mass. And in the role of the hero, which the late Leslie Howard performed with wondrous grace and sensitivity on the stage and in the previous film, Tyrone Power is stolid and moody, as though he had been tapped on the head.You may remember the story—of a modern-day American who, inheriting an old house in London, becomes so enamored of the past that, by some peculiar dislocation, he is transmigrated back into the eighteenth century in the shape of an ancestor and, in that age of affectation, loves and loses a long-ago girl.Well, in this retelling of the story, for which Ranald MacDougall has done the script, the gentleman's modern-day connections are brought completely up to date. He is a nuclear physicist, considerably weary and worn—and perhaps just a little radioactive—from over-work in an English lab. Thus, there's a possible suspicion that his strange difficulties with Time derive in some unexplained manner from hanging around a nuclear pile.Certainly the scientific knowledge here credited to him supports an elaboration that was not in the original play. Our hero, distressed at the ignorance and want of the eighteenth century, sets up a secret laboratory in London, where he artfully contrives working models of the camera, the steamboat, storage batteries and the incandescent bulb. And it is the discovery of these devices that brings his detractors to believe that he is, indeed, a minion of the devil and that a madhouse is the best place for him.As you can see, a disposition toward mechanical things dominates the flavor of the fantasy in this case. It also serves to angle the plot into byways of mechanistic doodling that drains much of the fanciful charm. For the rest, the humor inherent in the play's clever incongruities is heavily handled and pompously smothered in handsome period sets and costumes. The eighteenth-century phases of the story are rather conventionally photographed in under-lighted Technicolor","excerpt":"the modern phases are in black-and-white.In addition to Mr. Power as the changeling, the predominantly British cast includes Ann Blyth as the eighteenth-century sweetheart; Beatrice Campbell as an outraged fiancée; Irene Browne as a fluttery English mother and Michael Rennie as a modern scientist.

Furthermore, the Modern still presents even the most emotionally charged documentary photographs at a cool distance from the reality they represent. \\n\\n The good news is that within these self-imposed limitations, the Modern has not lost its touch. It can still come up with a group of new photographs that make a good show.

Revisionists who for decades have been questioning the seamlessness of the history of 20th-century art as the Modern portrayed it may complain that it doesn't go far enough.    Realists will recognize the installation, which has just gone on view, for what it is: a prudent, serious, often provocative, overdue self-examination of the richest and by far the most influential presentation of 20th-century art in the world, one that has come to define the canon of modernism.

She impersonates Mamie Smith, the rôle created on the stage by Alice Brady. Mamie is a hoyden, cheerful and mischievous, the inmate of an orphan asylum, who frequently finds the forbidding countenance of the matron glowering down upon her at the height of her fun. Miss Davies is lively, perhaps too lively in these introductory sequences, but occasionally in her moods there is a flash of Mary Pickford. It is not long before Mamie is permitted to make herself attractive","excerpt":"the moment she leaves the orphanage she sheds the gloomy trappings, and the unplaited pigtails burst forth like spun gold over her head. Hence in the end it is a very pleasant picture of Miss Davies that the spectators carry away with them, the sight of the orphan child serving as a contrast to the real Miss Davies.\\"Zander the Great\\" begins with touches of pathos and sunshine in a small place in New Jersey and winds up with an exciting hail of bullets in a Mexican hacienda. It is rather a dull story as presented in film form, but George Hill, the director, has stirred up the interest with comedy and drama when the opportunity arose. Miss Davies is at her best in the amusing scenes, particularly one in which she adjures the two cowpunchers to go through the operation of a haircut and a shave. In this interlude Mamie Smith clips Texas's hair with a saucepan covering the top of his cranium, and with a pair of horse clippers she makes Good News's chin astonishingly presentable. Harry Watson acts the part of Good News and Harry Myers figures as Texas. The former skilfully shovels food down his capacious mouth by means of the useful old-fashioned knife, held in his horny, grimy hand.Mamie drove all the way from New Jersey to the Mexican border in a small automobile with little Zander and a couple of rabbits. When Mamie is asked if she came from the East all alone, she laughs and asks the cowpunchers whether they have ever traveled with two rabbits. Her reason for making the long journey was to find Zander's father, and she is at first given to believe than Dan Murchison is the parent of the motherless youngster. Murchison and Juan Fernandez are engaged in a profitable rum-running business, which fact is discovered by the inquisitive Mamie. There is a trapdoor cleverly concealed by twigs and foliage, and Mamie one day creeps down into the cellar and at once realizes the lawless occupation of the couple.There are times when Miss Davies smiles as if enjoying the fun when she is in a predicament that calls for a sneer. In some sad moments a smile seems to play about the corners of her mouth. She is impressive when she is really happy, when she is wild with anger, or in a faint.Mamie is caught in a sandstorm, which is pictured quite realistically, with the blurred figure struggling against wind and sand. Mamie had fired a shot at Dan because he had stolen little Zander from her. She falls into the hands of Black Bart's desperadoes, from whom she escapes and gallops on to Juan's hacienda across the border. Black Bart and his band pursue her, with the result that there is a bloody encounter, in which one perceives Juan suddenly fall to the floor without having had the chance to fire either of the pistols he holds in each hand. The bandits believe they have polished him off and leave him. Juan rises, remarking that it is an old trick to pretend to be dead. All we've got to say is that Juan was pretty lucky that Black Bart did not take another shot at him to make sure he was dead, as then this old trick would lose some of its comedy.Harrison Ford is only fair as Murchison, as his facial expressions do not always suit the mood of the character. Harry Myers and Mr. Watson are amusing as the cowpunchers, and George Siegmann is effective as Black Bart. Little John Huff is sweetly natural as Zander. Richard Carle has the minor rôle of a kindly trustee, and Emily Fitzroy, as usual, is efficient as the stern matron. Holbrook Blinn, as Juan, does not get as much of an opportunity as he deserves.

But as the music's general novelty has worn off, its pleasures have proved to be enduring, even if most American listeners can't understand the lyrics. On Sunday at the Prospect Bark Bandshell, Celebrate Brooklyn presented its fifth annual Africa Mondo Festival, a six-hour show of African and Caribbean groups, and five of the six bands on the bill made for a jubilant afternoon.

While the situations are so absurd that they remind one of the old-fashioned race track yarns, they are none the less funny.This effusion deals with a little snob, a co-educational college and a relay race in which girls are the contestants. A title like \\"The Mouse and the Monocle\\" would have been more suitable to this photoplay than the suggestion of \\"The College Widow,\\" for, surprising as it may seem, a mouse does his bit in this yarn and so does a monocle. The eyeglass denotes the snob, and is worn by Patricia Mansfield, whose European affectation has to be cured by a course in a tried and trusted co-educational institution. Patricia is accustomed to suites rather than sharing a room with another girl. She endeavors to be haughty with her monocle, but only succeeds in arousing ridicule. She is eager to belong to a sorority and is surprised that the members are selected and not admitted through application. The monocle aided and abetted in all her weird ideas of so-called blue-blooded culture.The mouse then turns up on the scene. He is a nice little white mouse, nonchalant at times and frequently tenacious. The animal is the property of a well-meaning hayseed traveling under the euphonic appellation of Knute Knudson. The mouse escapes on more than one occasion, but the time that it serves its Alma Mater best is when it seeks refuge on Patricia's ankle while she is watching the girls run a race. Patricia never intended to join them, but the sudden discovery that her ankle might be bitten by the horrid mouse, causes her to run, and she runs so fast that she leaves the other girls far behind. It is, therefore, not astonishing that Charlie Paddock, incidentally impersonated by the crack runner, should wish to have the flet-footed Patricia take part in the college relay race.There is the customary idea of suspense, worked out in quite an original fashion. And the producers have not omitted to have a nice-looking young man who falls in love with Patricia. This hero is played by James Hall, who is quite satisfactory. Miss Daniels keeps the momentum of the picture going in a violent fashion. Mr. Paddock, the champion runner, is natural as the trainer. Ralph Spence and \\"Rube\\" Goldberg are responsible for the clever titles.\\"American Beauties\\" is the title of John Murray Anderson's stage offering, which posses originality, but has a little too much dancing. It deals, of course, with the Atlantic City beauty pageant, and has no little charm in its artistic effects.

Is it Oriental or Occidental, secular or Muslim, ugly or beautiful, rich or poor? Here the arrogant certainty of New York or London is lacking. Its inhabitants regard their city with an appealing ambiguity and perplexity, yet it surely has as much to offer as any other on earth. The skyline of the old city still takes the breath away (and one notes with gratitude that no modern structures have been allowed to challenge the supremacy of Hagia Sophia and the Mosque of Suleiman). The Bosporus is still an azure ribbon or rope twisting between wooded hills, villas and palaces.\\n\\n It is true, of course, that this busy strait is crossed by two suspension bridges, but the assertion that Istanbul is ''a bridge between East and West'' is likely to provoke tired smiles or theatrical yawns among natives of the place. Since it ceased to be the capital of great empires (as it was from the early 4th century to the early 20th century), since its grandiose embassies were reduced to consulates and the ambassadors suddenly found themselves marooned in the provincial boredom of Ankara, Istanbul has been very much a city on the edge. CELEBRATION: ISTANBUL","excerpt":"The Mood"},{"year":"1963","title":"ANOTHER exquisite motion picture embracing the timeless flow of life in India has rolled from the eloquent camera of the protean Satyajit Ray, and in every respect it tinkles echoes of his classic \\"Apu\\" trilogy.\\"Two Daughters,\\" a pair of vignettes adapted from stories by Rabindranath Tagore, the poet and 1913 Nobel Prize winner, opened yesterday at Cinema II. Like the previous pictures produced and directed by Mr. Ray, it penetrates the surface of Indian culture to touch the universal heart of man.Although the first vignette, called \\"The Postmaster,\\" is the shorter and is considerably more simple and unassuming in character and plot, it conveys such a wealth of revelation and understanding with its few dramatic strokes that it stands as a thing of full expression, a cinematic gem.It merely recounts the experience of a timid, benign young man who comes from the great city of Calcutta to be the new postmaster in a poor village in the interior. There he inherits as his housekeeper a 10- or 12-year-old orphan girl. More to keep busy than to improve the child, he offers to teach her to read and write. His consideration completely overwhelms the little thing.He is moving along in this routine when a bout with malaria adds to the anxieties that make him want to leave. The child doesn't know his intention until the day he is to depart, and then its significance hits her.The final scene between the two generates such simple but profound emotion that it pierces the heart. Seldom have I felt so regretful at taking leave of a character in a film.Beautiful as the youngster is little Chandana Bannerjee. A wistful, chipmunklike creature, she has the large, expressive eyes of the Indian child and an utterly magical gift for projecting feeling. Anil Chatterjee is soft and genial as the pathetic young man.The second vignette, \\"The Conclusion,\\" is reminiscent of the discovery of village character and custom in \\"The World of Apu,\\" the last film of Mr. Ray's trilogy. It tells of a college student who returns to his village on vacation and becomes involved in a matrimonial venture both humorous and sad.Here the authority of the mother, the desire for community respect, the lethargy of the Indian nature and the timidity of the young toward sex are wonderfully, simply illuminated in the remarkably detailed but economical graphic style of Mr. Ray. The psychic experience of the young hero is as pregnant and recognizable as the throb of life itself.Soumitra Chatterjee, who played the young husband and widower in \\"The World of Apu,\\" is excellent as the young man. As the girl he weds, Aparna Das Gupta is lovely and volatile.The script, the direction and the music, all created by Mr. Ray, make a blend of poetic creation that is almost majestic. As in all of his pictures, the rhythm is slow and serene","excerpt":"the mood and the spirit are quite different from what we ordinarily get in American films. But these are marks of its distinction. They make for a rare experience that should be much enjoyed. worldlings, is now contemporary Japan, where the demented hero circulates among villagers troubled by his eerie candor and selflessness.Some viewers may at first wonder just what is going on (and \\"first,\\" remember, is the length of one feature film). The very subtitles are as splintery and confusing as the incidents, as Mr. Mori sweetly pries a fallen woman from two enraged suitors and attracts a virtuous young girl. That, at least, is what it looks like as the scenes tumble and scatter pell-mell and, as the strong-faced actors examine one another soulfully.Add a strictly Occidental musical score, complete With \\"heavenly\\" voices, Grieg, Mussorgsky and \\"The Anniversary Waltz.\\" Part 1 also contains, in a torchlighted ice carnival, a suggestion of the brilliance to come, and brilliance is the word.At midpoint Mr. Kurosawa pulls the whole thing together superbly as a \\"simmering romantic quadrangle, with the doomed hero as the mystical catalyst. In a strong, sure flow of precise images and stately tempos, the picture vibrates and explodes introspectively while the four principals square off.The acting is piercing and in grand style, and one showdown—with Mr. Mori, Setsuko Hara (the courtesan), Toshiro Mifune (as her paramour) and Yoshiko Kuga (as the smitten maiden) — is a model of simmering tension. Mr. Kurosawa does minute wonders with a lurking camera. The film's real fadeout would have been memorable had not someone tacked on a soggy postscript.Japan's \\"Idiot\\" is quite a picture, for the patient.

The plot serves to display the characters in a conventional kind of motion, as a model's walk displays her clothes. It serves as a vehicle for making tours of the setting","excerpt":"the more rambling and full of holes it is, the better the view.The plot of the new Italian film, \\"Sunday Woman,\\" is as full of holes as a plateful of macaroni. It creaks and rambles but it takes us through a dry and lovely comedy of manners, with Marcello Mastroianni, Jacqueline Bisset and Jean-Louis Trintignant all making the most of parts that allow them to show their gifts for stylishness and subtlety.It is set among the rich and bored—a favorite predeliction of Italian films—this time, in Turin. It is a society of busy industrialists and wives who have plently of time and means for odd games and exotic relationships. For example, Ana Maria Dosio, wife of a rich businessman, spends a lot of time with Massimo Campi, the idle son of a rich family. The relationship is more or less platonic—Massimo has a young man as a lover—and is occupied mostly by a search for style. Massimo, for example, decides that it would be equally vulgar to own an expensive car and a cheap one, so he takes taxis. As the movie opens, the two of them are engaged in an interminably reasoned quarrel over whether pronouncing \\"Boston\\" with a Bostonian rather than an Italian intonation is the intelligent or the pretentious thing to do.Into this cobweb life two things erupt. Somebody smashes the head of Garrone, an unlikable crumb attached to Turin's upper crust. The weapon is one of the counterfeit ancient stone phalluses that he sells to foreigners. Quite a few members of Turinese high society, including Ana Maria and Massimo, had reason to dislike Garrone. So, with the greatest reluctance, the authorities put Inspector Santamaria on the case. Hiss assignment, in effect, is to solve the crime without catching anybody.Santamaria is the most winning and nuanced role that Mastrioanni has had for some time. He is a serious man of the middle class. He has aspirations to the good life, dresses in sport clothes that are a little too careful, and has an eye for women; but he is a moralist.He is sanely apprehensive about his mission. \\"Dsio. Dsio. Campi. Campi,\\" he mutters, the emphasis acknowledging the trouble he will have with his glittering list of suspects. But he pursues it with tenacity.The encounters of this naïve, sensitive but purposeful man with the sophisticated and purposeless Beautiful People of Turin are the film's heart. There is a marvelous first encounter with Massimo, played by Trintignant. Santamaria offers American cigarettes; Massimo insists on cheap local ones. Santamaria quotes an appropriate Latin tag: Massimo says he doesn't know Latin. Santamaria is after the good things; Massimo, who has them all, rejects them as vulgar.The comedy turns serious when Santamaria discovers Massimo's young lover. The two poses crack — Santamaria is deadly serious about the crime; Massimo is deadly serious about his lover — and the two are suddenly shouting at each other. Trintignant makes his jaded sophisticate both funny and affecting, man teetering on the edge of a crackup.Santamaria's encounters with Ana Maria are even better. Again, seriousness — this time in the form of mutual attraction—breaks through the comical and mannered fencing. Jacqueline Bisset, a beautiful and most skilled actress who is usually starved on silly parts, is a battleground of real feeling and decadent detachment, a tempest in a crystal wine glass.There is a whole gallery of minor characters, some of them trite but most with at least a few moments of comic inspiration. Aldo Reggiani is particularly good as Massimo's young lover; a mixture of dopiness and moonstruck passion.The ending of \\"The Sunday Woman,\\" which opened yesterday at the Fine Arts Theater, is a surprise, but it is a distant surprise and irrelevant. A mystery villain should be under our noses all the time. It is the final creak in the plot, but I was too pleased by the scenery to mind the destination.

This is from \\"Dialogues With Leuco,\\" translated by William Arrowsmith and D. S. Carne-Ross (Eridanos).   Had it been possible, I would gladly have done without all this mythology. But myth, it seems to me, is a language of its own, an instrument of expression. There is nothing arbitrary about it. It is a seedbed of symbolic forms, possessing, like all languages, its own range of meanings which can be conveyed in no other way. When we retell an old myth -- a proper name, an action, a heroic feat -- we are expressing, with the utmost economy of means, a general and comprehensive fact, a core of reality which quickens and feeds a whole organic growth of passion and human existence, an entire conceptual complex. . . . The surest, and the quickest, way for us to arouse the sense of wonder is to stare, unafraid, at a single object. Suddenly -- miraculously -- it will look like something we have never seen before. Landscape's Hazy Beauty     What stirs and pleases us in a natural vista? Lafcadio Hearn, writing in 1887, insisted that it took distance to make a view sublime. This is from \\"Wandering Ghost: The Odyssey of Lafcadio Hearn\\" by Jonathan Cott (Knopf).   Probably more than one reader, on coming to page 15 of Philip Gilbert Hamerton's delightful book,    Landscape   , was startled by the author's irrefutable statement that \\"the possession of very good eyesight may be a hindrance to those feelings of sublimity that exalt the poetic imagination.\\" The fact is, that the impressiveness of natural scenery depends a great deal upon the apparent predominance of    mass    over    detail   , to borrow Mr. Hamerton's own words","excerpt":"the more visible the details of a large object -- a mountain, a tower, a forest-wall -- the less grand and impressive that object. The more apparently uniform the mass, the larger it seems to loom; the vaguer a shadow-space, the deeper it appears. . . . Again, attractive objects viewed vaguely through a morning or evening haze, or at a great distance, often totally lose artistic character when a telescope is directed upon them. Motion's Steady Dance     Howard Nemerov's poem \\"Seeing Things\\" suggests that poetry and science are complementary ways of grasping nature's essential, uncanny unity. This is from \\"The World Treasury of Physics, Astronomy, and Mathematics,\\" edited by Timothy Ferris (Little, Brown).   Close as I ever came to seeing things  The way the physicists say things really are  Was out on Sudbury Marsh one summer eve  When a silhouetted tree against the sun  Seemed at my sudden glance to be afire:  A black and boiling smoke made all its shape.  Binoculars resolved the enciphered sight  To make it clear the smoke was a cloud of gnats,  Their millions doing such a steady dance  As by the motion of the many made the one  Shape constant and kept it so in both the forms  I'd thought to see, the fire and the tree.  Strike through the mask? you find another mask,  Mirroring mirrors by analogy  Make visible. I watched till the greater smoke  Of night engulfed the other, standing out  On the marsh amid a hundred hidden streams  Meandering down from Concord to the sea.   Endangered Enchantment     Roger Scruton pleads for the preservation of a sense of the sacred in our increasingly denatured lives, in the title piece from his essay collection \\"The Philosopher on Dover Beach\\" (St. Martin's).   It is difficult . . . to retain the sense of the sacred without the collective ritual which compels us to listen to the voice of the species. For the modern intellectual, who stands outside the crowd, the memory of enchantment may be awakened more easily by art than by prayer. Yet art, properly understood, is a kind of prayer: it is an attempt to call the timeless and the transcendental to the scene of some human incident. . . . And without the sacred, man lives in a depersonalized world: a world where all is permitted, and where nothing has absolute value. That, I believe, is the principal lesson of modern history, and if we tremble before it, it is because it contains a judgment on us. The hubris which leads us to believe that science has the answer to all our questions . . . contains already the punishment of those who succumb to it.   Fingerprints of the Past     In 1920 the archeologist Herbert Winlock unearthed in an Egyptian tomb a room filled with vivid models of ancient lives and labors. His exhilarating description of the find is included in \\"Doorways Through Time: The Romance of Archaeology\\" by Stephen Bertman (Tarcher, paper).   The beam of light shot in to a little world of four thousand years ago, and I was gazing into the midst of brightly painted little men going this way and that. A tall, slender girl gazed across at me perfectly composed . . . rowers tugged at their oars on a fleet of boats, while one ship seemed floundering right in front of me with its bow balanced precariously in the air. And all of this busy going and coming was in uncanny silence, as though the distance back over the forty centuries I looked across was too great for even an echo to reach my ears. . . . In that dry, still, dark little chamber those boats and statues had stood indifferent to all that went on in the outer world, as ancient in the days of Caesar as Caesar is to us, but so little changed that even the fingerprints of the men who put them there were still fresh upon them.

One, in reference to doughs, is: What is a ''sponge''? The second: Can the same formula be used for making French bread and home-style loaves?   A sponge is a ''starter'' for bread making","excerpt":"the most commonly known is used for making sourdough bread. That starter is perpetuated from batch to batch and may be made with commercially sold yeast or with ''wild yeast spores,'' which are produced over a period of time when a mixture of flour and water is allowed to ferment naturally.   The sponge that impresses us most is one we encountered some time ago in a now out-of-print, 75-year-old bread-making manual published by a flour manufacturer. This sponge is made by kneading a small quantity of flour with a blend of yeast and water.

Perhaps as a consequence, she approaches this overheated subject with a certain amount of detachment, as if she were standing at its periphery, neither too deep inside nor too far removed. Such critical distance is crucial because while the model operas were wholesale kitsch extravaganzas and enjoyably nutty, at least in the short clips included here, they were also deadly serious. The brainchild of Jiang Qing, a former actress turned dictatorial spouse of Mao, they were backlot Potemkin villages, elaborate cardboard visions meant to hide untold mass suffering.

Coltrane, who would have been 79 today, was not only a titan of the tenor and soprano saxophones, but also one of jazz's great paradigm-shifters","excerpt":"the most remarkable thing about the new albums is that each captures him in transition.

The Stone welcomes Rashied Ali, the fiery drummer who joined Coltrane's group a handful of months after the Half Note sessions; he offers testimony to Coltrane's questing late period, along with the bassist Reggie Workman (another former Coltrane bandmate), the trumpeter Roy Campbell, the saxophonist Louie Belogenis and the pianist Andrew Bemkey.

Bush's news conference on Iraq, as provided by CQ Transcriptions, Inc.BUSH: Thank you all very much. I'm going to spend a little more time on my opening comments than I usually do, but I'll save plenty of time for questions. Over the past three years, I have often addressed the American people to explain developments in Iraq. Some of these developments were encouraging, such as the capture of Saddam Hussein, the elections in which 12 million Iraqis defied the terrorists and voted for a free future, and the demise of the brutal terrorist Zarqawi. Other developments were not encouraging, such as the bombing of the U.N. headquarters in Baghdad, the fact that we did not find stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction, and the continued loss of some of America's finest sons and daughters. Recently, American and Iraqi forces have launched some of the most aggressive operations on enemy forces in Baghdad since the war began. They have cleared neighborhoods of terrorists and death squads and uncovered large caches of weapons, including sniper scopes and mortars and powerful bombs. There had been heavy fighting. Many enemy fighters had been killed or captured. And we've suffered casualties of our own. This month we've lost 93 servicemembers in Iraq","excerpt":"the most since October of 2005. During roughly the same period, more than 300 Iraqi security personnel have given their lives in battle. Iraqi civilians have suffered unspeakable violence at the hands of the terrorists, insurgents, illegal militias, armed groups and criminals. The events of the past month have been a serious concern to me and a serious concern to the American people. Today I will explain how we're adapting our tactics to help the Iraqi government gain control of the security situation. I will also explain why, despite the difficulties and bloodshed, it remains critical that America defeat the enemy in Iraq by helping the Iraqis build a free nation that can sustain itself and defend itself. Our security at home depends on ensuring that Iraq is an ally in the war on terror and does not become a terrorist haven like Afghanistan under the Taliban. The enemy we face in Iraq has evolved over the past three years. After the fall of Saddam Hussein, a sophisticated and violent insurgency took root. Early on, this insurgency was made up of remnants of Saddam Hussein's Baath Party, as well as criminals released by the regime. The insurgency was fueled by Al Qaida and other foreign terrorists who focused most of their attention on high-profile attacks against coalition forces and international institutions. We learned some key lessons from that early phase in the war. We saw how quickly Al Qaida and other extremist groups would come to Iraq to fight and try to drive us out. We overestimated the capability of the civil service in Iraq to continue to provide essential services to the Iraqi people. We did not expect the Iraqi army, including the Republican Guard, to melt away in the way that it did in the face of advancing coalition forces. Despite these early setbacks, some very important progress was made in the midst of an incredibly violent period. Iraqis formed an interim government that assumed sovereignty. The Iraqi people elected a transitional government; drafted and adopted the most progressive democratic constitution in the Arab world; braved the car bombs and assassins to choose a permanent government under that constitution; and slowly began to build a capable national army. Al Qaida and insurgents were unable to stop this progress. They tried to stand up to our forces in places like Fallujah -- and they were routed, so they changed their tactics. In an intercepted letter to Osama bin Laden, the terrorist Zarqawi laid out his strategy to drag Iraq's Shia population into a sectarian war. To the credit of the Shia population, they resisted; responding to the horrific violence against them for a long time. Yet the persistent attacks, particularly last February's bombing of the Golden Mosque in Samarra, one of the Shia Islam's most holy shrines, eventually resulted in sectarian reprisals. The cycle of violence in which Al Qaida insurgents attacked Shia civilians and Shia death squads retaliated against Sunnis has sharply increased in recent months, particularly in Baghdad. As the enemy shifts tactics, we are shifting our tactics as well. Americans have no intention of taking sides in a sectarian struggle or standing in the crossfire between rival factions. Our mission is to help the elected government in Iraq defeat common enemies, to bring peace and stability to Iraq and make our nation more secure. Our goals are unchanging. We are flexible in our methods to achieving those goals. On the military side, our commanders on the ground are constantly adjusting our tactics to stay ahead of our enemies. We are refining our training strategy for the Iraqi security forces, so we can help more of those forces take the lead in the fight and provide them better equipment and firepower to be successful. We've increased the number of coalition advisers in the Iraqi ministries of defense and interior, so they can better plan and execute security operations against the enemy. We have changed our force structure so we can better respond to the conditions on the ground. For example, during the Iraqi elections, we increased our force levels to more than 150,000 troops to ensure people could vote. Most recently, we have moved additional coalition and Iraqi forces into Baghdad, so they can help secure the city and reduce sectarian violence. After some initial successes, our operations to secure Baghdad have encountered greater resistance. Some of the Iraqi security forces have performed below expectations. Many have performed well and are fighting bravely in some of Baghdad's toughest neighborhoods. Once again, American troops are performing superbly under very difficult conditions. Together with the Iraqis, they've conducted hundreds of missions throughout Baghdad. They've rounded up or killed key insurgents and death squad leaders. As we fight this enemy, we are working with the Iraqi government to perform -- the performance -- to improve the performance of their security forces, so they can regain control of the nation's capital and eventually assume primary responsibility for their country's security. A military solution alone will not stop violence. In the end, the Iraqi people and their government will have to make the difficult decisions necessary to solve these problems. So, in addition to refining our military tactics to defeat the enemy, we're also working to help the Iraqi government achieve a political solution that brings together Shia and Sunni and Kurds and other ethnic and religious groups. Yesterday, our ambassador to Iraq, Zal Khalilzad, laid out a three-step approach. First, we're working with political and religious leaders across Iraq, urging them to take steps to restrain their followers and stop sectarian violence. Second, we're helping Iraqi leaders to complete work on a national compact to resolve the most difficult issues dividing their country. The new Iraqi government has condemned violence from all quarters and agreed to a schedule for resolving issues such as disarming illegal militias and death squads, sharing oil revenues, amending the Iraqi constitution and reforming the de-Baathification process. Third, we are reaching out to Arab states such as Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Jordan, asking them to support the Iraqi government's efforts to persuade Sunni insurgents to lay down their arms and accept national reconciliation. The international community is also supporting the international compact that outlines the support that will be provided to Iraq as it moves forward with its own program of reform. These are difficult tasks for any government. It is important for Americans to recognize that Prime Minister Maliki's unity government has been in office for just over five months. Think about that: This young government has to solve a host of problems created by decades of tyrannical rule, and they have to do it in the midst of raging conflict against extremists from outside and inside the country who are doing everything they can to stop this government from succeeding. We are pressing Iraqi's leaders to take bold measures to save their country. We're making it clear that America's patience is not unlimited. Yet we also understand the difficult challenges Iraq's leaders face. And we will not put more pressure on the Iraqi government than it can bear. The way to succeed in Iraq is to help Iraq's government grow in strength and assume more control over its country as quickly as possible. I know the American people understand the stakes in Iraq. They want to win. They will support the war as long as they see a path to victory. Americans can have confidence that we will prevail because thousands of smart, dedicated military and civilian personnel are risking their lives and are working around the clock to ensure our success. A distinguished independent panel of Republicans and Democrats, led by Former Secretary of State Jim Baker and Former Congressman Lee Hamilton, is taking a fresh look at the situation in Iraq and will make recommendations to help achieve our goals. I welcome all these efforts. My administration will carefully consider any proposal that will help us achieve victory. It's my responsibility to provide the American people with a candid assessment on the way forward. There is tough fighting ahead. The road to victory will not be easy. We should not expect a simple solution. The fact that the fighting is tough does not mean our efforts in Iraq are not worth it. To the contrary, the consequences in Iraq will have a decisive impact on the security of our country, because defeating the terrorists in Iraq is essential to turning back the cause of extremism in the Middle East. If we do not defeat the terrorists or extremists in Iraq, they will gain access to vast oil reserves and use Iraq as a base to overthrow moderate governments across the broader Middle East. They will launch new attacks on America from this new safe haven. They will pursue their goal of a radical Islamic empire that stretches from Spain to Indonesia. I know many Americans are not satisfied with the situation in Iraq. I'm not satisfied either. And that is why we're taking new steps to help secure Baghdad and constantly adjusting our tactics across the country to meet the changing threat. But we cannot allow our dissatisfaction to turn into disillusionment about our purpose in this war. We must look at every success -- we must not look at every success of the enemy as a mistake on our part, cause for an investigation or a reason to call for our troops to come home. We must not fall prey to the sophisticated propaganda by the enemy, who is trying to undermine our confidence and make us believe that our presence in Iraq is the cause of all its problems. If I did not think our mission in Iraq was vital to America's security, I'd bring our troops home tomorrow. I've met too many wives and husbands who've lost their partners in life; too many children who won't ever see their mom and dad again. I owe it to them and to the families who still have loved ones in harm's way to ensure that their sacrifices are not in vain. Our country's faced adversity before during times of war. In past wars, we've lost young Americans who gave everything to protect our freedom and way of life. In this war, we've lost good men and women who've given their lives for a cause that is necessary and it is just. We mourn every loss. And we must gird ourselves for the sacrifices that are yet to come. America's men and women in uniform are the finest in the world. I'm awed by their strength and their character. As General Casey reported yesterday in Iraq, the men and women of the armed forces have never lost a battle in over three years in the war. Every American can take pride in our troops and the vital work they are doing to protect us. Our troops are fighting a war that will set the course for this new century. The outcome will determine the destiny of millions across the world. Defeating the terrorists and extremists is the challenge of our time and the calling of this generation. I'm confident this generation will answer that call and defeat and ideology that is bent on destroying America and all that we stand for. And now I'll be glad to answer some of your questions. QUESTION: Mr. President, the war in Iraq has lasted almost as long as World War II for the United States. And as you mentioned, October was the deadliest month for American forces this year -- in a year. Do you think we're winning, and why? BUSH: First of all, this is a different kind of war than a war against the fascists in World War II. We were facing a nation state -- two nation states -- three nation states in World War II. We were able to find an enemy by locating its ships or aircraft or soldiers on the ground. This is a war against extremists and radicals who kill innocent people to achieve political objectives. It has a multiple of fronts. Afghanistan was a front in this war against the terrorists. Iraq is now the central front in the war against the terrorists. This war is more than just finding people and bringing them to justice. This war is an ideological conflict between a radical ideology that can't stand freedom and moderate, reasonable people that hope to live in a peaceful society. And so it's going to take a long time. I am confident we will succeed. I am confident we'll succeed in Iraq. And the reason I'm confident we'll succeed in Iraq is because the Iraqis want to succeed in Iraq. The ultimate victory in Iraq, which is a government that can sustain itself, govern itself and defend itself, depends upon the Iraqi citizens and the Iraqi government doing the hard work necessary to protect their country. And our job is to help them achieve that objective. As a matter of fact, my view is: The only way we lose in Iraq is if we leave before the job is done. And I'm confident we can succeed in the broader war on terror, this ideological conflict. I'm confident because I believe the power of liberty will defeat the ideology of hate every time, if given a chance. I believe that the radicals represent the few in the Middle East. I believe the majority of people want to live in a peaceful world. That's what I believe. And I know it's incumbent upon our government, and others who enjoy the blessings of liberty, to help those moderates succeed. Because otherwise we're looking at the potential of this kind of world, a world in which radical forms of Islam compete for power; a world in which moderate governments get toppled by people willing to murder the innocent; a world in which oil reserves are controlled by radicals in order to extract blackmail from the West; a world in which Iran has a nuclear weapon. And if that were to occur, people would look back at this day and age and say, What happened to those people in 2006? How come they couldn't see the threat to a future generation of people? Defeat will only come is the United States becomes isolationist and refuses to, one, protect ourselves; and, two, help those who desire to become -- to live in a moderate, peaceful world. And it's a hard struggle; no question about it. And it's a different struggle. QUESTION: Are we winning? BUSH: Absolutely we're winning. Al Qaida's on the run. As a matter of fact, the mastermind, or the people who they think is the mastermind of the September the 11th attacks, is in our custody. We've now got a procedure for this person to go on trial, to be held for his account. Most of Al Qaida that planned the attacks on September the 11th have been brought to justice. Extremists have now played their hand. The world can clearly see their ambitions. You know, when a Palestinian state began to show progress, extremists attacked Israel, to stop the advance of a Palestinian state. They can't stand democracies. Extremists and radicals want to undermine fragile democracy because it's a defeat for their way of life, their ideology. People now understand the stakes. We're winning and we will win, unless we leave before the job is done. And the crucial battle, right now, is Iraq. And as I said in my statement, I understand how tough it is, really tough. It's tough for a reason, because people understand the stakes of success in Iraq. And my point to the American people is that we're constantly adjusting our tactics to achieve victory. QUESTION: Are you considering sending more U.S. troops to Iraq? What would be the justification for it? And how reliable is this new timetable of 12 to 18 months? BUSH: The -- I will send more troops to Iraq if General Casey says, \\"I need more troops in Iraq to achieve victory.\\" And that's the way I've been running this war. I have great faith in General Casey. I have great faith in Ambassador Khalilzad. I trust our commanders on the ground to give the best advice about how to achieve victory. I want to remind you, victory is a government that can sustain itself, govern -- it's a country that can govern itself, sustain itself and defend itself and serves as an ally in the war on terror -- which stands in stark contrast to a government that would be chaotic, that would be a safe haven for the enemy to launch attacks on us. One way for the American people to understand what Iraq could look like is what Afghanistan looked like under the Taliban -- a place where there was no freedom, a place where women were taken to the public square and beaten if they did not adhere to the strict, intolerant guidelines of the Taliban, a place where thousands trained to attack America and our allies. Afghanistan doesn't have nearly the resources that Iraq has. Imagine a safe haven for an enemy that ended up with the resources that it had. And so this is a war where I say to our generals, Do you have what it takes to win? Now, General Casey talked about part of our strategy. And part of the strategy is to give the Iraq government the tools necessary to protect itself, to defend itself. If you're able to defend yourself, you're more likely to be able to govern yourself, as well. But politics, the political way forward, and the military way forward, must go hand in hand. And what the general was saying yesterday is that there is a three-step process to enable the Iraqi forces to be able to help this government bring security. One was to train and equip. The goal is 325,000 troops -- 137,000 military and the balance police. Second was to put the Iraqi security forces in the lead. Six of 10 divisions now are in the lead in helping this government defend itself. The strategy has been to embed U.S. personnel, officers and noncomm. officers, into these forces to help them gain the confidence and the capacity to be effective when they're in the lead. And the third step is for the Iraqi security forces to be able to operate independently. And this, perhaps, is going to be one of the most difficult aspects of having the Iraqis ready to go, because that means they have to be able to drive themselves, maintain their vehicles, provide logistics, have a combat service support. And that's what General Casey was describing. The key is that our commanders feel that they have got enough flexibility to design the program to meet the conditions on the ground. You know, last spring, I thought for a period of time we'd be able to reduce our troop presence early next year. That's what I felt. But because we didn't have a fixed timetable and because General Casey and General Abizaid and the other generals there understand that the way we're running this war is to give them flexibility, have the confidence necessary to come and make the recommendations here in Washington, D.C., they decided that that wasn't going to happen. So what he was describing to you was the way forward, to make sure that the Iraqis are fully prepared to defend themselves. QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE) BUSH: It's a conditions-based estimate. And that's important for the American people to know. This notion about, you know, fixed timetable of withdrawal, in my judgment, means defeat. You can't leave until the job is done. Our mission is to get the job done as quickly as possible. QUESTION: Mr. President, for several years, you have been saying that America will stay the course in Iraq. You were committed the policy. And now you say that: No, you're not saying stay the course, that you're adapting to win, that you're showing flexibility. And as you mentioned, out of Baghdad we're now hearing about benchmarks and timetables from the Iraqi government, as relayed by American officials, to stop the sectarian violence. In the past, Democrats and other critics of the war who talked about benchmarks and timetables were labeled as defeatists, Defeatocrats, or people who wanted to cut and run. So why shouldn't the American people conclude that this is nothing from you other than semantic, rhetoric games and all politics two weeks before an election? BUSH: There is a significant difference between benchmarks for a government to achieve and a timetable for withdrawal. You're talking about -- when you're talking about the benchmarks, he's talking about the fact that we're working with the Iraqi government to have certain benchmarks to meet as a way to determine whether or not they're making the hard decisions necessary to achieve peace. I believe that's what you're referring to. And we're working with the Iraqi government to come up with benchmarks. Listen, this is a sovereign government. It was elected by the people of Iraq. What we're asking them to do is, When do you think you're going to get this done? When can you get this done? -- so the people themselves in Iraq can see that the government is moving forward with a reconciliation plan and plans necessary to unify this government. That is substantially different from people saying, We want a time certain to get out of Iraq. As a matter of fact, the benchmarks will make it more likely we win. Withdrawing on an artificial timetable means we lose. Now, I'm giving the speech -- you're asking me why I'm giving this speech today -- because there's -- I think I owe an explanation to the American people and will continue to make explanations. The people need to know that we have a plan for victory. Like I said in my opening comments, I fully understand that, if the people think we don't have a plan for victory, that they're not going to support the effort. And so I'll continue to speak out about -- about our way forward. QUESTION: Sir, you've called Iran part of the axis of evil, and Syria a state sponsor of terrorism. You said earlier today that your administration will consider any proposal that will help us achieve victory. So I'm wondering: If it's determined that Iran and Syria could help you achieve victory in Iraq, would you be willing to work with them? BUSH: Iran and Syria understand full well that the world expects them to help Iraq. And we've made that very clear to them. Let me talk about the Iranian issue. We've got a lot of issues with Iran. The first is whether or not they will help this young democracy succeed. The second issue, of course, is whether or not they will help the Lebanese democracy succeed, the Siniora government, which is a priority of this government -- is to help that Siniora government. The big issue right now is whether or not Iran will end up with a nuclear weapon. And so, our issues with Iran are many. And our position is very clear to the Iranians: There is a better way forward for the government and the people than to be isolated. And we will continue to work to make it clear to the Iranian government that -- on all three accounts -- the sponsor of terrorists will cause more isolation. We've got a very active diplomatic effort taking place. The Iranians know our position on Iraq, and they know it clearly. More importantly, they know the Iraqis' position relative to Iran. We're helping a sovereign government succeed. And the Iraqis have sent messages to the Iranians: To help us succeed, don't interfere in the internal affairs. As to Syria, our message to Syria is consistent: Do not undermine the Siniora government in Lebanon. Help us get back the -- help Israel get back the prisoner that was captured by Hamas. Don't allow Hamas and Hezbollah to plot attacks against democracies in the Middle East. Help inside of Iraq. They know our position, as well. QUESTION: May I just follow, please? James Baker has himself said that he believes the U.S. should work with Iran. So would you be willing to work with Iran in a way that allows some sort of negotiations in Iraq, even if they don't come to the table in the P-3 and P-5... BUSH: Iran has a chance to come to the table with the United States to discuss a variety of issues. And the way forward is one that I had made clear at previous press conferences. And that is, if they would verifiably stop their enrichment, the United States will be at the table with them. In the meantime, they understand our position and they understand, more importantly, the Iraqi position about the interference inside their country. QUESTION: Prime Minister Maliki apparently gave his own news conferences this morning, where he seemed to be referring to Ambassador Khalilzad and General Casey yesterday, when he said nobody has the right to set any timetables in Iraq, and also seemed to be upset about the raid in Sadr City, saying he wasn't consulted. And, I believe the quote was, It will not be repeated. Do you still have full, complete and total confidence in Prime Minister Maliki as a partner in Iraq? And what can you tell the American people about his ability to rein in the militias, since he seems to derive much of his power front them? BUSH: First, this is back to the question that David asked about benchmarks. You called it timetables. OK, we call it timetables. Excuse me. I think he's referring to the benchmarks that were developing that show a way forward to the Iraqi people -- and the American people, for that matter -- about how this unity government is going to solve problems and bring the people together. And if his point is that those benchmarks, or the way forward, can't be imposed upon Iraq by an outside force, he's right. This is a sovereign government. But we're working closely with the government to be able to say, Here's what's going to happen then, Here's what we expect to happen now, Here's what should be expected in the future. The second part of your question? QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE) BUSH: Oh, on the sectarian -- on the militias -- I heard that and I asked to see his complete transcript of this press conference where he made it very clear that militias harm the stability of his country; people who operate outside the law will be dealt with. That's what the prime minister said in his press conference. The idea that, you know, we need to coordinate with him makes sense to me. And there's a lot of operations taking place, which means that, sometimes, communications may not be as good as they should be. And we'll continue to work very closely with the government to make sure that the communications are solid. I do believe Prime Minister Maliki is the right man to achieve the goal in Iraq. He's got a hard job. He's been there for five months -- a little over five months. And there's a lot of pressure on him -- pressure from inside his country. Look, he's got to deal with sectarian violence, he's got to deal with criminals, he's got to deal with Al Qaida; all of whom are lethal. These are people that will kill. And he wants to achieve the same objective I want to achieve. And he's making tough decisions. I'm impressed, for example, by the way that he has got religious leaders, both Sunni and Shia, to start working together. I appreciate the fact that he has made a very clear statement on militias. And by the way, death squad members are being brought to justice in this plan -- during these operations in Baghdad. And I speak to him quite frequently. And I remind him we're with him, so long as he continues to make tough decisions. That's what we expect. We expect that the Iraqi government will make the hard decisions necessary to unite the country and listen to the will of the 12 million people. QUESTION: North Korean leaders apparently today warned South Korea against joining international sanctions, saying South Korea would pay a high price if they did so. Are you still confident that South Korea and China will implement the full force of the U.N.-passed sanctions? And what happens if North Korea continues to thumb its nose at the world? BUSH: I believe that -- first of all, I've been briefed on this subject recently by the secretary of state who just came back from the Far East. She met with the Japanese, the South Koreans, the Chinese and the Russians. Her report is that all countries understand we must work closely together to solve this problem peacefully. And that means adhering to the latest United Nations Security Council resolution that was passed. The leader of North Korea likes to threaten. In my judgment, what he's doing is just testing the will of the five countries that are working together to convince him there is a better way forward for his people. I don't know the exact words he used, but this is not the first time that he's issued threats and our goal is to continue to remind our partners that when we work together, we're more likely to be able to achieve the objective, which is to solve this problem diplomatically. And so I would report to you the coalition remains firm. And we will continue to work to see to it that it does remain firm. QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you for taking questions today. BUSH: What was that? QUESTION: Thank you for taking questions today. BUSH: I'm just happy to be able to do so, brother. (LAUGHTER) I can't tell you how joyful it is. (LAUGHTER) QUESTION: When you first ran for president, sir, you talked about the importance of accountability. We learned from Bob Woodward's recent book that Secretary Card (sic) on two occasions suggested that you replace Secretary Rumsfeld, and both times you said no. Given that the war in Iraq is not going as well as you wanted, given that you're not satisfied, as you just told us today... BUSH: Right. QUESTION: ... why hasn't anybody been held accountable? Should somebody be held accountable? BUSH: You're asking me why I believe Secretary Rumsfeld is doing a good job, I think, if I might decipher through the Washington code. QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE) BUSH: Well, let's start with Rumsfeld, Secretary Rumsfeld. I've asked him to do some difficult tasks as the secretary of defense: One, wage war in two different theaters of this war on terror, Afghanistan and Iraq; and, at the same time, asked him to transform our military posture around the world and our military readiness here at home. The transformation effort into itself is a big project for any secretary to handle. But to compound the job he has, he's got to do that and at the same time wage war. And I'm satisfied of how he's done all his jobs. He is a smart, tough, capable administrator. As importantly, he understands that the best way to fight this war, whether it be in Iraq or anywhere else around the world, is to make sure our troops are ready, that morale is high, that we transform the nature of our military to meet the threats, and that we give our commanders on the ground the flexibility necessary to make the tactical changes to achieve victory. This is a tough war in Iraq. I mean, it's a hard fight, no question about it. All you got to do is turn on your TV. But I believe that the military strategy we have is going to work. That's what I believe. And so we've made changes throughout the war; we'll continue to make changes throughout the war. But the important thing is whether or not we have the right strategy and the tactics necessary to achieve that goal. And I believe we do. (CROSSTALK) BUSH: Wait a minute, let me -- the ultimate accountability rests with me. That's the ultimate -- you're asking about accountability -- that's -- that's -- it rests right here. It's what the 2004 campaign was about. You know, people want to -- if people are unhappy about it, look right to the president. I believe our generals are doing the job I asked them to do. They're competent, smart, capable men and women, and this country owes them a lot of gratitude and support. Yeah, now Dick. Sorry. QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. President. BUSH: That was a clever little follow-up you slipped in there. Sorry, Gregory. I mean, look, Gregory's still mad he didn't the follow-up, but that's okay. (Laughter.) QUESTION: You've said, Mr. President, several times here this morning that the definition of failure in Iraq would be to leave before the job was done, but you also said that you have no intention of seeing our troops standing in the crossfire of a sectarian war within that country, with many observers on the ground saying that civil war in Iraq is as close as it's ever been. How do you reconcile those two statements? And what happens if a full-fledged civil war breaks out? BUSH: Our job is to prevent the full -- full-scale civil war from happening in the first place. It's one of the missions, is to work with the Maliki government to make sure that there is a political way forward that says to the people of Iraq, It's not worth it. Civil war is not worth the effort -- by them. That's the whole objective: to help this government be able to defend itself and sustain itself, so that the 12 million people that voted -- they didn't vote for civil war. They voted to live under a constitution that was passed. And so we will work to prevent that from happening. (CROSSTALK) BUSH: Let me finish. I view that this is a struggle between radicals and extremists who are trying to prevent there to be a democracy, for a variety of reasons. And it's in our interests that the forces of moderation prevail, in Iraq and elsewhere in the Middle East. A defeat there -- in other words, if we were to withdraw before the job is done, it would embolden extremists who would say, You know, we were right about America in the first place, that America did not have the will necessary to do the hard work. That's precisely what Osama bin Laden has said, for example. A defeat there would make it easier for people to be able to recruit extremists and kids to be able to use their tactics to destroy innocent life. A defeat there would dispirit people throughout the Middle East who wonder or not whether -- who wonder whether America is genuine in our commitment to moderation and democracy. And I told you what the scenario, Dick, could look like 20 or 30 years from now if we leave before the job is done. It's a serious business, and that's why I say it's the call of this generation. And I understand how tough it is, see, but I also said in my remarks just because the enemy has been able to, you know, make some progress doesn't mean we should leave. Quite the contrary, we ought to do everything we can to help prevent them from making progress, and that is what our strategy is. Elaine. QUESTION: (Off mike.) BUSH: You're asking me hypotheticals. Our job is to make sure there's not one, see. Been around here five and a half years; you know I won't answer hypotheticals. Occasionally slip up, but... QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. President. You talk about the U.S. government and the Iraqi government working closely together on benchmarks. I'm wondering, sir: Why was Prime Minister Maliki not at the news conference yesterday with General Casey and Ambassador Khalilzad? Would that not have sent a strong message about there being a very close level of cooperation between the two governments? BUSH: I have no idea why he wasn't there. QUESTION: Was he invited, sir? BUSH: I have no idea. I'm not -- I'm not the scheduler of news conferences. I do know they work very closely together and they've got a very close working relationship, and that's important... QUESTION: May I ask you, sir, following up: When you said that you're not satisfied with the way things are going in Iraq, why should that not be interpreted by some to mean that you are dissatisfied with Prime Minister Maliki's performance? BUSH: Because I know Prime Minister Maliki, I know how hard his job is, and I understand that he is working to make the decisions necessary to bring this country together. And he's -- look, we'll push him, but we're not going to push him to the point where he can't achieve the objective. And we'll continue to work with him. He is a -- he represents, you know, a government formed by the people of Iraq. It's a -- and he's got a tough job. I mean look, think about what his job is like. He's got to deal with political factions. He's got to deal with the hatred that is left over from the tyranny of Saddam Hussein. There's a lot of people still furious about what happened to them during Saddam Hussein's period. You can imagine that. What happens if your brother or sister were -- had been assassinated by Saddam Hussein and his political party. You wouldn't be happy about it. Reconciliation is difficult in a society that had been divided and tortured by a tyrant. And Prime Minister Maliki has got the difficult job of reconciling these grievances and different political parties on top of that, plus dealing with violence. I've talked to him a lot. I like his spirit. I like his attitude. He's confident we can achieve the mission. He's not -- you know, he's realistic about how difficult it is in Iraq. It's in our government's interests that we help him succeed. Because he wants a unified country. And I believe we will succeed. I know we're not going to succeed, however, if we set artificial timetables for withdrawal or we get out of there, or we say to the enemy, just keep fighting; we'll leave soon. That's not going to work. What will work is a strategy that's constantly -- tactics that constantly change to meet the enemy. And that's what I was describing in my speech. We're constantly adjusting. As the enemy changes, we change. War is not -- this war and other wars -- they're not static. They're dynamic events. And we must adjust to meet those events. And we are. QUESTION: Does the United States want to maintain permanent bases in Iraq? And I would follow that by asking, are you willing to renounce a claim on permanent bases in Iraq? BUSH: Any decisions about permanency in Iraq will be made by the Iraqi government. And, frankly, it's not in much of a position to be thinking about what the world's going to look like five or 10 years from now. They are working to make sure that we succeed in the short term. And they need our help. And that's where our focus is. But remember, when you're talking about bases and troops, we're dealing with a sovereign government. Now, we entered into an agreement with the Karzai government. They weren't called permanent bases, but they were called arrangements that will help this government understand that there will be a U.S. presence so long as they want them there. And at the appropriate time, I'm confident we'll be willing to sit down and discuss, you know, the long-term security of Iraq. But right now we're discussing how to bring security to Baghdad and what do we do in al-Anbar Province, where Al Qaida still uses violent methods to achieve political objectives. You know, it's interesting, if you -- I'm sure people who watch your TV screens think the entire country is embroiled in sectarian conflict and that there's constant killing everywhere in Iraq. Well, if you listened to General Casey yesterday, you know, 90 percent of the action takes place in five of the 18 provinces. And around Baghdad, it's within a 30-mile area. And the reason I bring that up is that while it seems to our American citizens that nothing normal is taking place -- and I can understand why. It's a brutal environment there, particularly that which is on our TV screens. That -- there is, you know, farmers farming. There are small businesses growing. There's a currency that's relatively stable. There's an entrepreneurial class. There's commerce. General Abizaid was describing to me what it was like to, you know, go to Baghdad markets. There's a lot work to be done. Don't get me wrong, but there are people living relatively normal lives who I believe -- strongly believe -- that they want to continue that normalcy. And it's up to Prime Minister Maliki to do everything he can to make the situation as secure as possible. QUESTION: Thank you, sir. Is the coming election a referendum on Iraq? Should it be? BUSH: I think the coming election is a referendum on these two things: which party has got the plan that will enable our economy to continue to grow and which party has a plan to protect the American people. And Iraq is part of the security of the United States. If we succeed and when we succeed in Iraq, our country will be more secure. If we don't succeed in Iraq, the country is less secure. The security of this country -- and, look, I understand here in Washington, some people say we're not at war. I know that. They're just wrong, in my opinion. The enemy still wants to strike us. The enemy still wants to achieve safe haven from which to plot and plan. The enemy would like to have weapons of mass destruction in order to attack us. These are lethal, cold-blooded killers. And we must do everything we can to protect the American people, including questioning detainees or listening to their phone calls from outside the country to inside the country. In other words, as you know, there was some recent votes on that issue. And the Democrats voted against giving our professionals the tools necessary to protect the American people. I will repeat, like I've said to you often: I do not question their patriotism; I question whether or not they understand how dangerous this world is. And this is a big issue in the campaign. Security of the country is an issue, just like taxes are an issue. If you raise taxes, it will hurt the economy. If you don't extend the tax cuts, if you don't make them -- in other words, if you let the tax cuts expire, it will be a tax increase on the American people. Take the child tax credit. If it is not made permanent -- in other words, if it expires -- and you've got a family of four sitting around the breakfast table, the taxpayers can be sure that their taxes will go up by $2,000: $500 for that child, $500 for the one right there; $500 for this one and $500 for that one. That is a tax increase. And taking $2,000 out of the pockets of the working people will make it harder to sustain economic growth. So the two issues I see in the campaign can be boiled down to who best to protect this country and who best to keep taxes low. That's what the referendum's about. QUESTION: Thank you, sir. You've long talked about the importance when the federal government is involved in an effort, spending money and resources, of measuring success, accountability, as Peter said. Now you've set some benchmarks on the Maliki government. You've said that you're expecting him to make tough decisions. Can you tell the American people how you plan to measure his success in reaching those benchmarks and what happens if he doesn't hit those benchmarks? BUSH: The first objective is to develop benchmarks that the government agrees with and that we think are important. You can't -- it's really important for the American people to understand that to say, OK, these are the benchmarks you must live with, is not going to work nearly as effectively as if we have -- when we have buy-in from the government itself, the sovereign government of Iraq. And so the step is to say to the Maliki government -- which we're doing -- let us work in concert to develop a series of benchmarks to achieve different objectives. And the purpose of that is to assure the Iraqi people that this unity government is going to work for the improvement of the Iraqi people. In other words, it'll be beneficial for the government to say to the Iraqi people, Here's what we intend to do and here's when we intend to do it. It'll also be beneficial for the American people to be able to see that this Iraqi government is going to make the difficult decisions necessary to move forward to achieve the goal. And that's what we're talking about when it comes to benchmarks. Again, I repeat: One should not expect our government to impose these benchmarks on a sovereign government. You'd expect us to work closely with that government to come up with, you know, a way forward that the government feels comfortable with. And there are probably going to be some bones of contention during these discussions. But nevertheless, we'll respect the fact that the Iraq government is sovereign. And they must respect the fact that we've got patience, but not unlimited patience. QUESTION: Follow-up: What happens when that patience runs out? BUSH: See, that's that hypothetical he was trying to get me to answer. Why don't we work to see that it doesn't work out -- run out? That's the whole objective. That's what positive people do. They say, We're going to put something in place and we'll work to achieve it. QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. President. With a Republican Congress, you failed to achieve three major goals of your second term: Social Security reform, a tax code overhaul and a comprehensive immigration bill. QUESTION: Why shouldn't Americans give Democrats a chance to work with you on those issues, especially when divided governments seemed to work in the late 1990s on the budget? BUSH: That's a tricky little question there. (LAUGHTER) I -- first, I haven't given up on any of those issues. I've got two years left to achieve them. And I firmly believe it is more likely to achieve those three objectives with a Republican-controlled Congress and a Republican-controlled Senate. And I believe I'll be working with a Republican-controlled Congress and a Republican- controlled Senate. I understand, here in Washington, people have already determined the outcome of the election like it's over, even before the people actually start heading -- you know, voting. But that's not what I see when I'm on the campaign trail. You know, we've got some people dancing in the end zone here in Washington, D.C., measuring their drapes. They're going over to the Capitol and saying, My new office looks beautiful. I think I'm going to have this size drape there, or this color. But the American people are going to decide, and they're going to decide this race based upon who best to protect the American people and who best to keep the taxes low. Secondly, I'll tell you what I see. You didn't ask, but I'm going to tell you anyway. I see a lot of enthusiasm amongst the grassroots activists. Our people are going out there to man the phones and to put up the yard signs. You know, they're showing up when it comes time for these absentee votes. We're organized. We've got a fantastic grassroots organization to turn out the vote. This campaign has obviously got national implications to it, no question about it: the Iraq war, the security of the country, economic vitality and growth. But each of these elections turn out to be local in their scope and in their character. And we got good candidates, running hard. And we're going to win. Now, I know that defies conventional wisdom here. I'm not suggesting anybody in this august crowd has determined the outcome of the election already. But they're running profiles on who -- this person's going to be running this office or this one. These magazines have got all kinds of new stars emerging, when they hadn't even won the votes yet. And anyway, thanks for asking about the campaign. I'm enjoying it out there. I like campaigning. It's what guys like me do in order to get here. We campaign. We shake the hands, you know, and give the speeches. And Laura's campaigning, too. And from my perspective, our people are ready to go out there and vote our candidates back into power. QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. President. Your comment earlier that last spring you believed that troops would be able to come home early next year... BUSH: Yes? QUESTION: ... I wonder if you could talk to us about how you came to believe that, and over what period of time, or whether it was a single development because you realized that wasn't feasible. BUSH: No, no, no. Look, here's the way it works. You know, I meet with our -- or talk to our generals all the time, and the security situation looked like at that point in time that, beginning next year, we could reduce our troop presence. That's what we felt -- until the conditions on the ground changed. And when they changed, our generals changed their attitude. And when their attitude changed, my attitude changed. Look, I want to get our troops home as fast as we can. But I do not want to, you know, leave before we achieve victory. And the best way to do that is to make sure we have a strategy that works, tactics that adjust to the enemy, and commanders that feel confident making recommendations to the secretary and to the commander in chief. And that's how that happened, you know? In other words, they're saying it looks like things are positive, things are stepping up. The security situation, you know, looks like it could be this way. And then when it changed, we changed. And that's important for the American people to know, that we're constantly changing tactics to meet the situation on the ground. (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: I just wanted to ask you quickly, sir, if you believe that Iraq will be able to defend, sustain and govern itself by the time you leave office? BUSH: I believe Iraq will be able to defend, govern and sustain itself. Otherwise, I'd pull our troops out. See, you already understand that. And the parents of our troops must understand that if I didn't believe we could succeed and didn't believe it was necessary for the security of this country to succeed, I wouldn't have your loved ones there. That's what I want these parents to hear. And, you know, that's a backhanded way of getting me to put a timetable. My answer is, we'll work as fast as we can get the job done. QUESTION: I understand what you would claim, or assert, that the Republicans will win the midterm elections. But if in your heart of hearts, you really didn't think that, would you tell us so? And are you resentful that some Republican candidates seem to be distancing themselves from you? BUSH: You know, no, I'm not -- nor am I resentful that a lot of Democrats who are using my picture. All I ask is that they pick out a good one. (LAUGHTER) Make me look good, at least, on the picture. Mark, the first part of your question -- the serious part -- if I thought we were going to lose, would I tell you -- we're not going to lose -- my heart of hearts. (LAUGHTER) Now, again, I understand how -- look, I read -- look at the newspapers around here. I can see why you think that, you know, I'm concealing something in my heart of hearts. The race is over as far as a lot of the punditry goes. You know, they've got it all figured out. And they just -- as I said, they're dancing in the end zone. They just hadn't scored the touchdown. You know, there's a lot of time left. And these candidates are working hard out there. And my message to them is: Keep talking about the security of the United States and keeping taxes low, and you'll come back here. Last question. QUESTION: Back in 2000, you campaigned around the country, saying you wanted to usher in the responsibility era, to end the days when people said: If it feels good, do it; and, if you've got a problem, blame somebody else. BUSH: Right. QUESTION: Over the last several months, we've seen many members of your own party in Congress embroiled in one scandal or another, and all too ready to blame somebody else, whether prosecutors or Democrats or even the media. So I'm wondering: Why do you think it is so many people in your own party have failed to live up the standards of the responsibility era? BUSH: If any person in any party fails to live up to high standards, they ought to be held to account. It's important for there to be trust in the halls of Congress and in the White House and throughout government. People have got to trust elected leaders in order for democracy to work to its fullest extent. And I fully expect, you know, people to be held to account if there's wrong-doing; just like I expect corporate executives to be held to account for wrong-doing, just like I expect people throughout our society to be held to account for wrong-doing. People do have to take responsibility for the decisions they make in life. I take responsibility for the decisions I make. I also understand that those of us in positions of responsibility have the duty to bring, you know, honor to the offices we hold. People don't have to agree with somebody's opinion. There's all kinds of opinions here. But in order to make this country work and to make democracy succeed, there's got to be high standards and people must be held to account to achieve those standards. I thank you for your time. See you on the campaign trail.  President Bush on Iraq"},{"year":"1986","title":"MAKERS OF MODERN STRATEGY From Machiavelli to the Nuclear Age. Edited by Peter Paret with Gordon A.

No New Wave movie contains more of that movement's spirit than ''Shoot the Piano Player.'' There is the loving yet knowing poetic distillation of American genre films (in this case, noir), and the location shooting that builds on the open-air tradition that Renoir and Vigo brought to French film of the 30's.

CHRONICLE"},{"year":"1974","title":"For over a year, many movies have been insisting that the past was prettier than the present. But Michel Drach's \\"Les Violons du Bal\\"—which nearly drowns you in a cataract of facile charm—is the first picture that seems downright nostalgic about World War II. The film, which was the official French entry at the 1974 Cannes Film Festival, is a huge hit in France. Perhaps the French are grateful for this idylic view of their history, after the painful abrasions of Marcel Ophuls's \\"The Sorrow and the Pity,\\" Louis Malle's \\"Lacombe, Lucien,\\" and Michel Mitrani's \\"Black Thursday,\\" all of which dwell on collaboration with the Germans. The movie opened yesterday at the Regency Theater.The film focuses on the director's childhood during the German occupation of France, when his Jewish family tried to live in hiding and then escaped to Switzerland. Misty shots of handsome people moving gracefully through pastel landscapes make it almost impossible to believe these are fugitives fleeing for their lives. The elegant camera angles, the lovely clothes, the comely faces and the lush colors combine to cancel out the suffering of the French Jews","excerpt":"the movie's style is just too lyrical to convey their desperation or pain. Since their survival, seems as miraculous as a fairytale — instead of being rooted in human experience—we can't fear for them when the Germans approach, or when the bullets fly.In fact, the trouble with this sensitive but shallow movie is that it has bags of style but very little content. And the often-pleasing device of a film within a film only serves to weaken the material: the theme of a director who's determined to make a movie about his boyhood gives the wary potential investor some trenchant lines. The latter is meant to be appallingly commercial when he protests that this movie won't work. He's a cliché figure when he says that it needs to be livelier, that some sex and death would supply the vitality that's lacking. But he happens to be right when he complains about the lack of substance.Mr. Drach begins by playing himself as the frustrated director; he then does a life-swap with Jean-Louis Trintignant, while Marie-Josée Nat (who's married to Mr. Drach) is cast as his mother as well as herself, and their small son plays Mr. Drach as a child. The present is filmed in cinema vérité style in black and white, and the past wells up in color. Mr. Trintignant has almost no acting to do: he merely responds to \\"his\\" memories with sad or fond expressions.Miss Nat, who won the Best Actress award at Cannes for her performance as the totally beloved, utterly magical mother, is very beguiling in a liquid way. But her role is so idealized that we just can't swallow such perfection. The child is engaging: however he has been directed to be too poignant and too winsome, as well as wise beyond his years. All in all, \\"Les Violons\\" is one of those movies that's so tasteful it makes you feel boorish—and that's not a useful context for reflecting any kind of war.

There was a time when the sweet green pepper (broadly known as a bell pepper) was universally thought of as the basis of what might be termed capsicum cookery. Sweet red peppers were used for some basic dishes, such as red-pepper hash, or were roasted, as in the Italian kitchen, and bathed in oil and vinegar and chopped garlic.  Today, there has been an uncommon expansion of interest in two other ''colored'' peppers, the yellow and black (also known as chocolate or purple-black). The latter were little known in the United States as recently as two years ago. The majority of the yellow peppers were imported from the Netherlands.

The drama is unfurled in an easy, compelling fashion","excerpt":"the murder does not occur until the film is well on its way.Warner Baxter interprets the rôle of Captain Paul Onslow, the diplomatic representative from Sylvaria, a mythical republic. He is the sole member of the conference who stands out against a certain policy, and because he does so he receives letters threatening his life. The morning session of the conference is adjourned until 11 o'clock that night. The persons interested in seeing that Onslow is killed are hot on his trail, but it is not until past 6 that the figure of a man is seen entering Onslow's apartment, and soon afterward it becomes known that the Sylvarian representative has been strangled.Then there is the old scientist, Professor Otto Bauer, who claims to have discovered a ray which has given back life for six hours to mice and rabbits. Naturally he is anxious to test the effect of the ray and his apparatus on the dead man, but he maintains that even if he succeeds life will last only six hours. First one sees the professor's machine give back life to a rabbit and immediately afterward Onslow's body is submitted to the same operation. There is the necessary suspense during this episode, and finally the murdered man opens his eyes.As the time passes and Onslow appreciates that he has come from death, but only for six hours, he reveals that his beliefs have changed in many instances. There is the little girl who was anxious to sell her flowers, who is amply rewarded by Onslow. His valet discovers that he will take a gold cross as a charm against danger instead of the pistol he took with him before death. He votes at the conference as he had done before he was strangled, and he has his own ideas, since death, about vengeance.The strange state of affairs gives Onslow the chance to say to newspaper reporters: \\"Here's a story for you—very exclusive. It's not generally known, but at a quarter past 6 this evening I was murdered. Now I'm going to see the gentleman who took my life.\\"Warner Baxter gives one of his best performances. Miriam Jordan is pleasing as the leading feminine character and George Marion is capital as Professor Bauer. Others who add to the fascination of this film are Edwin Maxwell, Halliwell Hobbes and John Davidson.In addition to the stage show there is one of the best \\"Silly Symphony\\" cartoons (in color) that has been produced. It is called \\"King Neptune.\\" Melody and imagination leap hand in hand in this film. The footlight offering, directed by Frank Cambria, is called \\"On to Rio,\\" and once again the Roxyettes distinguish themselves by their graceful dancing.

But it also seemed that all that was needed was a few more performances to work out matters of detail, tone and structure.   The promise of these concerts could be heard in the final movement, Mahler's most haunting Adagio, which invokes kitsch and sentimentality, sarcasm and mockery, only to subsume them into an extended hymn that in its final pages can suspend the motion of time.

In its encyclopedic survey of religious feelings, Bach's work had imitated in its musical lines the lashes of a whip, the weeping of the faithful, the fury of a crowd, the mockery of nonbelievers","excerpt":"the music had followed the text of the passion, interpolated with the exquisite commentary of arias and chorales. In the concluding moments, all the contrasts and trials of the story seemed a dream, leaving behind a gentle faith.   This was obviously not, for Mr. Masur, a casual performance. There is, of course, the geographic connection he has with the music: Bach's passion was composed and first heard in Leipzig, where Mr. Masur has been music director of the Gewandhaus Orchestra since 1970. But Mr. Masur, in leading 24 members of the New York Philharmonic along with the Westminster Symphonic Choir in this work, also showed a close connection with its dramatic and religious meaning. The strict orthodoxies of authenticity were put aside, without doing harm to the score itself. There were times when matters became mundane, when there was too much stress, or too much exaggeration, but those were minor flaws in a performance that spoke of a deep love for this music and its powers.

For, in any comparative estimation of the entertainment merits of these two films — and, of course, the very closeness of their premieres makes comparison unavoidable—Mr. Disney's unreined improvisation upon the fine fantasies of Mr. Carroll must be declared the better by a margin of a couple of years.Note well, however, that we're judging by the entertainment merits of the film, not by its artistic fitness or its fidelity to the works of Mr. Carroll—and, right at this point, we might mention that Mr. Disney has borrowed for his film not only from \\"Alice in Wonderland,\\" but from \\"Through the Looking Glass,\\" as well. Merit as visual entertainment does not necessarily mean virtue (or even propriety) as a translation of a classic of literature.What we are saying is simply that Mr. Disney has plunged into those works, which have rapturously charmed the imaginations of generations of kids, has snatched favorite characters from them, whipped them up as colorful cartoons, thrown them together willy-nilly with small regard for sequence of episodes, expanded and worked up new business, scattered a batch of songs throughout and brought it all forth in Technicolor as a whopping-big Disney cartoon.Alice, for instance, is not the modest and plain-faced little English girl of Mr. Carroll's suggestion and of Sir John Tenniel's illustrations for the books. She is a rosy-cheeked, ruby-lipped darling right off Mr. Disney's drawing-board, a sister of Snow White, Cinderella and all the fairy-tale princesses he has drawn. And the musical sentiments she expresses, in Kathy Beaumont's dulcet voice, run more to \\". . . bluebirds, friendly how-de-do birds\\" than to simple observations upon things.Likewise, the fabulous Mad Hatter, while a wonderfully lunatic clown, giggles and chirps in the familiar and inseparable voice of Ed Wynn. The March Hare, as crazy as the Hatter, is Jerry Colonna to the ear. The mind's eye beholds these two comedians, rather than the unique conceits of Mr. Carroll. The Cheshire Cat, too, while richly comic in a vagrant and lunatic way, is mainly a cartoonist's triumph, plus the fey-voice of Sterling Holloway.Or let's take the haughty Caterpillar—he is a beautifully complicated snob who sits on a leaf, smokes his hookah and blows gorgeously multi-colored vowels. \\"Who (O) are (R) you (U)?\\" he asks Alice, and the letters of rainbow-smoke wreath themselves about her glamorous noggin and cause her to cough and kerchoo. A very clever demonstration of Disney, not Carroll, inventiveness. Likewise a whole new set of creatures called Mome Raths appear in one place, honking and scooting about like crazy. The mome raths out-grabe, indeed!But if you are not too particular about the images of Carroll and Tenniel, if you are high on Disney whimsey and if you'll take a somewhat slow, uneven pace, you should find this picture entertaining. Especially should it be for the kids, who are not so demanding of fidelity as are their moms and dads. A few of the episodes are dandy, such as the mad tea party and the caucus race","excerpt":"the music is tuneful and sugary and the color is excellent. Watching this picture is something like nibbling those wafers that Alice eats.Also on the bill with \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" is an even more wonderful Disney film—the third in his excellent series of True-Life Adventure shorts. It is a thing called \\"Nature's Half Acre,\\" which takes a wholly fascinating look-see at the prodigious wonders of nature that you may find on almost any piece of ground. By the use of marvelous telescopic cameras and new techniques of photography, it brings bees and birds and caterpillars and spiders and blossoming flowers right up within two inches of you and let's you watch them pursuing their livelihoods. It is filmed in superlative color, is cut and timed expertly and has an amusing commentary. This is well worth the price of the whole show.

My vote is for farce, because now that the dream has ended, it already seems like one of those all-American fables -- a classic Preston Sturges comedy like \\"Hail the Conquering Hero\\" perhaps, or one of General Powell's own favorite Broadway musicals, \\"The Music Man\\" -- in which Anytown, U.S.A., gives its heart, soul and wallets to a magnetic, dashing interloper in uniform who comes out of nowhere and promises to make the citizenry feel better about itself.         The press coverage will surely, with hindsight, make for hilarious reading. As the public, politicians and journalists alike jumped on the bandwagon, the will to believe in General Powell as a savior ballooned so rapidly that his candidacy soon became a miracle elixir -- an instant balm for every ailment in American civic life.

The duo even wrote a song proclaiming that its minimal lineup was not a \\"rhythm section want ad.\\" But things change, and at the Beacon Theater on Wednesday night, They Might Be Giants introduced a flesh-and-blood band, with bass, drums and keyboards. The new lineup traded some quick-change studio cleverness for clout, but could still hop styles and twist tunes with ease. Camouflaged as a rock band, though one with a polka combo just below the surface, They Might Be Giants were as tricky as ever.    Mr. Linnell and Mr. Flansburgh love pop's catchiness but distrust its seeming simplicity. Their songs complicate matters and treat incongruity as a fact of life, knocking together pop genres from country to mid-1960's Beatles to polkas to heavy metal to funk.

One tune used the words \\"Island for sale\\" as a passing riff. And everything he and his band played had the profound groove of the best dance music of the African diaspora, secure and unhurried.         The musicians, Kali on a small electric banjo, three percussionists, a bassist, two background singers and a guitarist, kept all their parts separate,  with air filtering through the space between each instrument. It's clear music:  polyphony, with each instrument taking a different part, adding up to a precise  combination of melodies and rhythm.

The Coasters, with Carl Gardner, on Saturday and the Brave New World Klezmer Ensemble next Sunday complete the opening weekend (631) 271-8423. On Saturday, the New York Pops, conducted by Skitch Henderson and with Maureen McGovern as special guest, start the season at Brookhaven's Bald Hill Amphitheater and Cultural Center in Farmingville.

Father's Day       Dads don't get the same attention that mothers receive, but there are a few nods today in the direction of Father's Day. For example, Chamber Players International does more than just close out its season. Its ''Musical Cuisine'' is devoted to ''Papa Bach,'' saluting fathers in general and that father in particular. Also marking Bach's 250th anniversary, the concert features Mark Peskanov, violinist, and Robert Wolinisky, harpsichordist, in a program that includes the A major Violin Concerto, the D minor Harpsichord Concerto and the Double Concerto for Two Violin Soloists, Harpsichord and Strings.

Dionne Times Three      Since she's traveling east to appear at the Westhampton Performing Arts Center, Dionne Warwick is making the most of her visit.

Then on Saturday, backed by her own 10-piece band, Ms. Warwick will recreate her greatest hits in a kind of ''Dionne Sings Dionne'' concert at 8:30 p.m. The center is on Main Street (631) 288-1500. Incidentally, if you miss Ms. Warwick this weekend, on July 30 she will be at the Westbury Music Fair (516) 334-0800.    'Cool' Brady Boy      For fans of ''The Brady Bunch'' television series the Patchogue Theater for the Performing Arts has something not to be missed. It's ''Growing Up Brady,'' Barry Williams's one-man show, described as a ''total Brady experience, an interactive multimedia presentation that includes, stories, videos, costumes, music and dance.'' Since Mr. Williams played Greg Brady, the so-called ''coolest'' Brady boy, his recollections, on Thursday at 8 p.m. at the theater on Main Street, should provide some behind-the-scenes insights (631) 286-1133.    From the Camps      Using the art, poetry and narrative created by the children held captive -- and mostly killed -- in the Terezin concentration camp, the Pushcart Players perform ''The Last, the Very Last . . . Butterfly'' at Guild Hall's John Drew Theater in East Hampton Friday through next Sunday. The production, emphasizing the poetry and narrative, is based on the book, ''I Never Saw Another Butterfly,'' which was derived from the works found after the war and donated to the Prague Jewish community. Of the 15,000 children imprisoned at Terezin and deported to Auschwitz, only 100 survived, none under the age of 14. The play will be performed at 8 p.m. Friday and Saturday and 2 p.m. Sunday, with Rabbi David Gelfand of the Jewish Center of the Hamptons leading discussions on Saturday and Sunday (631) 324-4050.    Wine Country Music      The East End Arts Council has just what North Fork residents and visitors might order: ''Wine Country Concert Series 2000.'' From 6:30 to 8:30 p.m., the six Saturday concerts at vineyards throughout the area turn the cocktail hour into mellow wine tours with musical interludes. The series begins Saturday at the Jamesport Wineyards on Main Road with the Lew Picardi Swing Orchestra and then continues weekly on July 8. For $10 a ticket (children under 12, free) audiences have to bring their own seating and, at an extra price, the vineyards will provide the liquid refreshments by the glass or the bottle (631) 727-0900.    Sited Sculpture      Artists in Greenport do not create in a vacumn. At least, when they participate in ''Footfalls 2000'' they take their environments seriously, coming up with site-specific sculptures that are ''very related to the sites they select,'' said Brenda Miller, an organizer of this year's exhibition of works by 13 artists that will be situated throughout the village. So, since Susan Smith has chosen a local beach, nicknamed ''Glass Beach,'' her piece with an erosion theme, will be fashioned from native plants she has hardened on the roof of her Manhattan apartment building and snow fencing. Pete Jauquet, Ms. Miller said, will ''bring the New York City subway to Greenport'' in the area of the ferry landing and bus and train station, but how and with what, she doesn't know. The exhibition runs through Sept. 24 after an opening reception Saturday at 4 p.m. at the Maritime Museum on Bootleg Alley when catalogs describing what's where will be available (631) 477-1572.    O'Hara and Music      Frank O'Hara wasn't just a poet-curator who inspired artists; he also had impact on composers, and on Saturday in connection with its current exhibition, ''In Memory of My Feelings: Frank O'Hara and American Art,'' the Parrish Art Museum, Job's Lane in Southampton, holds a concert, ''Words Set to Music.'' Performed by Marianne Koerner, soprano; and Scott Murphee, baritone; and Alvin Novak, pianist, the program at 6:30 p.m. features O'Hara poems set by Ned Rorem, John Gruen and Christopher Berg; Virgil Thomson's and William Bolcolm's settings of poems by Kenneth Koch and Arnold Weinstein, respectively, and the never-before performed ''Undercover Lover,'' written by O'Hara and Weinstein to Mr. Gruen's music (631) 283-2118.    Take a New 'Hedda'      The Bay Street Theater in Sag Harbor does something it has not done before -- stages a classic. Not any old classic, mind you; but Henrik Ibsen's masterpiece, ''Hedda Gabler.'' What's more, it will be a new version of the precedent-setting, turn-of-the-19th-century drama of a woman yearning to break free from a dull, bourgeois marriage; one by Jon Robin Baitz, the contemporary playwright who will leave the time frame intact while he fiddles with the rest. Produced in collaboration with the Williamstown Theater Festival, which gets the play after its run in Sag Harbor ends on July 9, and directed by Nicholas Martin, a veteran of the Williamstown festival, the drama's cast includes such noted actors as Kate Burton as Hedda, Harris Yulin as Judge Brack and Michael Emerson as George Tesman (631) 725-9500.    Free Choices      TODAY -- Chinese culture is celebrated in the ''Dragon Boat Festival'' that the Chinese Cultural Association of Great Neck holds at the High School South on Lakeville Road from 2 to 5 p.m. (516) 466-1248.    TOMORROW -- Every other month, 50 Long Islanders -- male, female; from teenagers to septuagenarians -- gather to worship at the shrine of two silent film comedians. Members of the local chapter of ''The Sons of the Desert, the International Laurel and Hardy Appreciation Society'' watch a few of their idols' movies, discuss them thoroughly and then share refreshments. This time out, they meet in the Reception Center at the Old Bethpage Village Restoration on Round Swamp Road (516) 826-8374.    SATURDAY -- Pony rides, face painting, music, tae kwon do and life-guarding demonstrations, and, yes, swimming will be on tap from noon to 4 p.m. at Meschutt Beach County Park in Hampton Bays during ''Family Fun Day'' (631) 852-8205.

Critic's Notebook","excerpt":"The Musical Returns To America"},{"year":"1952","title":"Ah, Paris! City of rich and mellow beauties! City of romance and mystery! City of wisdom, indulgence echoing footsteps—where lives mingle and flow in a restless, endless stream! . . . This is the concept of the city that Julien Duvivier rather fervidly expounds in his cross-section, multi-character French film, \\"Under the Paris Sky,\\" which brought back the flavor of La Belle France to the Paris Theatre yesterday.Don't be disturbed by the prospect of one of those dawn-to-mid-night things, \\"revealing the heart of a city,\\" such as used to fascinate the Europeans. Despite its heavy weighting on the side of a thematic cliché, this effort is fortunately balanced with ample imagination and cinema style. And although it does run a bit strongly toward a purple poetic attitude, especially in its English narration, which Duncan Elliott speaks in reverential tones, it is sharply realistic in its substance and in its Parisian pictorial detail.Mr. Duvivier is nobody's tyro at handling a drama with numerous threads. Witness his \\"Pepe le Moko,\\" \\"Un Carnet de Bal\\" and \\"The End of a Day.\\" Neither is he unaccomplished at creating atmosphere and mood. His camera seems blessed with the additional senses of touch and smell. And it is in an abundance and variety of sensuous stimuli that this ever-intriguing panorama of Parisian life is distinct.Making a routine departure with the misty break of day above the rooftops of Paris, Mr. Duvivier doesn't waste much time in getting his people assembled for this crisscrossed tapestry. There's the old lady who lives in a garret, where she keeps a veritable herd of hungry cats, and spends her day wandering the city trying to beg some money to buy them food. There's the young daughter of the vegetable merchant who goes for a boat ride on the Seine with a playmate of fanciful disposition and is casually abandoned by him. There is also a crippled sculptor who likes to cut ladies' throats and there's a middle-aged factory worker who cannot attend his own wedding anniversary because of a sit-down strike.Most notable, however, are a young fellow who must pass his medical school exams in order to become a surgeon, the beautiful dress model who is in love with him and a girl friend of the model who comes to Paris in search of fortune, love and fame. In the course of one day, all of them have adventures of a highly critical sort.Neither does Mr. Duvivier, who wrote and directed the film, allow time to waste or hang heavy at any point in the weaving of his tale. Using a style of fast cutting, which eliminates laps and dissolves, he moves from one story to another—and back and forth—without the usual movie punctuation marks. All of his little plots and people flow together through this narrative technique and eventually become associated in a full network of coincidences at the end. It is a style that is baffling at the outset but soon becomes clear and interesting.Being inclined toward morbid details, Mr. Duvivier has sprinkled his film with starkly arresting intrusions, such as a dead body floating in the Seine, a hospital tour with medical students and a glimpse of the sculptor's crippled hand. His most shocking detail, however, is an operation upon a human heart, with the live tissue of that throbbing organ exposed to the camera's close-up view. Such details are not merely shockers. They have distinct and constructive dramatic point—as, for instance, the heart operation symbolizes the very beat of the city's life and provides, as well, a climax for the most suspenseful drama in the film.Withal, the wonderful vistas of Paris, in which the picture abounds","excerpt":"the musical score of Jean Wiener, which is brilliant and expressive in every way, and the excellent performances of the actors continually intrigue. Daniel Ivernel as the medical student. Christiane Lenier as his girl, Brigitte Auber as the new arrival, Sylvie as the aged keeper of the cats and Jean Brochard as the hard-pressed factory worker are among the best of the lot.Mr. Duvivier's picture is feverish and romantic, it is true, but it offers a fascinating side tour of the great city that lies wrapped in the arms of the Seine.Also on the screen at the Paris is a placid, slightly wistful color short, \\"Ballet by Degas,\\" which examines some of that French painter's more familiar works—his poised and fluid ballet dancers, shimmering in tints of pink and blue.

In some respects the results of a man without a shadow have been nicely worked out, for not only does one see him standing in the garden minus a shadow, but when he is playing before a gathering the only shadow on the wall is that of the bow and the violin.A shadow may be even thinner than a cigarette paper, but it is brought out as quite an important possession. Those who have no shadows live under cloudy skies and in ill-lighted rooms. This is the penalty of a shadowless man. A man with a shadow loves to see it, for it comes forth through the brilliancy of the sun!It is the sardonic creature, with the suggestion of horns in his coiffure, who is the shadow-man of this story. He is rather a good-natured Satan. He smiles as he plots, and in the beginning he is much perturbed because one of his shadows is blown away. This loss handicaps him in giving his shadow performance at the castle. Later he discovers that the shadow that will make up for the missing one is that of the musician, so this devil, like a wizard, brings to light a wonderful violin, but no bow. The musician must have a bow, so the Shadow Man snaps off the twig of a tree and soon it is transmuted into a bow.Misunderstandings arise because the musician ventures abroad sans shadow. The romantic but substantial Barbara, leading lady of that section of the globe, is somewhat suspicious of any man without a shadow, even if he draws from his violin the most heavenly music. But in the end, this athletic young woman joins the musician and consents to be his shadow. So sunshine comes and the devil goes on his way with his infernal silhouette entertainment.Mr. Wegener, who is an actor of no mean merit, gives quite a capable performance as the musician. Mr. Sturm, although a little stagey sometimes, makes Satan a happy-go-lucky schemer and the title writer makes him talk like Charles Dickens's Alfred Jingle.

Though there was rarely any significant formal variation, the musicians -- Marcus Belgrave, Mr. Marsalis and Nicholas Payton, the trumpeters; Vincent Herring, Wes Anderson and Todd Williams, the saxophonists; Marcus Roberts, the pianist; Reginald Veal, the bassist, and Herlin Riley, the drummer -- mostly flaunted an esthetic that until recently had only been a shadowy presence in jazz. In the solos by Mr. Payton and Mr. Marsalis, by Mr. Williams on tenor saxophone and especially by Mr. Roberts, a broad swath of jazz's stylistic history was food for creativity, making the improvisations extraordinarily rich and detailed.

This decision by a United Nations tribunal pleases Western governments trapped in the Bosnian disaster as it will please millions passionate against the Bosnian Serbs.   All right, then, the question is: What now?    How do you negotiate with men you demand be arrested on sight?  The answers I get from officials of the U.S., the U.N., the tribunal and diplomatic veterans of Bosnian peace negotiations are totally clear: \\"We don't know.\\"    The price of making negotiations impossible by issuing arrest warrants for one side can be terrifyingly high. Without peace talks, the ever-deeper Western involvement can bring Europe to where it stood 81 years ago this week -- at the cusp of a world war.    The issue was what Bismarck had predicted would bring war one day -- \\"some damn foolish thing in the Balkans.\\" It turned out to be Serbia. Crowds in Austria, which wanted to swallow Serbia, screamed, \\"Serben mussen sterben.\\" Serbs must die.    The outlines of a Bosnian solution have been heartbreakingly obvious. Yesterday I received a faxed letter from one of the indicted men, the Bosnian Serb President, Radovan Karadzic. It came after I had inquired among supporters of the Bosnian Serbs in the U.S. about the Serbs' bottom line.   Dr. Karadzic said the \\"blueprint for peace\\" was a European plan of 1993, originated by Lord Owen of Britain and Thorvald Stoltenberg of Norway. It called for the recognition of Muslim, Croatian and Serbian republics within a loose Bosnian government. The plan gave 49 percent of the land to the Muslim republic, 33.5 to the Serbs and 17.5 percent to the Bosnian Croats, and proposed two years of U.N. administration of Sarajevo.    Dr. Karadzic said that the plan meant self-determination for all parts of the former Yugoslavia. Interpretation: The Serbs must have the same rights of self-determination and alliance that the Muslims and Croatia have won.    The Bosnian Serbs and Croats accepted the European plan","excerpt":"the Muslims did not. Two years later, the West has to recognize that putting pressure on the Bosnian Serbs will not bring peace unless some is also put on the Muslims.    But how to resume negotiations? One way would be for the top Serbs to fly off somewhere, maybe Pakistan or Iran, which have offered to jail them, and hold out their wrists. Or the West could do what the Muslims want -- stall negotiations until the Bosnian Serbs are smashed. That would take a massive Western invasion, followed by an occupation to keep the Serbs submissive, something not even the Nazis managed.   The other is to think of gimmicks to get around the negotiating roadblock of the arrest edict. Hold them in Bosnia? No, that would make the site an instant death trap. U.N. headquarters? Not legal, says the tribunal prosecutor. An Italian judge even raises the question whether any country can negotiate with indicted men. So -- \\"We don't know.\\"   The concept of war-crime trials is important. But after the World War II trials, the nations lost enthusiasm. Saddam Hussein was not tried for invading Kuwait. Hafez al-Assad of Syria got away clean with capturing Lebanon. That fellow in Libya, whose terrorists the West says blew up Pan Am 103, still sits in his deluxe tent, receiving figs and ambassadors.    Pol Pot faced no court for mass murder in Cambodia. The Communist Chinese not only get away with using torture and slavery as tools in the international market, but have a judge sitting on that U.N. tribunal.   The nations run from every war-crime trial that is politically or economically inconvenient, which has meant everybody but the Bosnian Serbs.    Still, the world should not bury war-crime charges with the victims. The tribunal has not finished looking into charges against Muslims and Croats. Any trials should come when peace is negotiated -- and for accused from all sides at the same time.    Like Congressional pressure to arm the Muslims, the Serb-only indictments, coming now, postpone peace. Every delay kills more people, every single day, to no avail.   In that other July, in 1914, then too the great men of power did not believe it could ever really happen, the guns of August.

After testing them back to back, here is how I stack them up:    STYLING: Mazda's wee roadster is now a half-size bigger, but looks none the worse for it. With big wheel arches and other hints of the RX-8 sports car, it seems less of a toy. Still, the shape is familiar. It's the Solstice -- fresh, frisky and as sexy as anything this side of a Ferrari -- that causes widespread violations of the Tenth Commandment.    DRIVETRAIN: Mazda's higher-revving engine is more lively, but somewhat buzzy. The Pontiac four-cylinder feels more conventional, but has a throaty roar. The six-speed manual shifter in the MX-5 Grand Touring is excellent, though Pontiac's five-speed works fine. If you must have an automatic, Mazda offers a nifty six-speed that you can shift with paddles behind the steering wheel. The lighter MX-5 feels quicker, and it is.    HANDLING: Both cars' weight is almost perfect balanced, front to rear. The Mazda is quick and darty, and its steering is lighter, with less feedback. The Solstice is nimble despite its extra weight, and it has tenacious grip. Pontiac's steering is quick, on-center and weighted just right, with excellent ''feel.'' Both are great fun to fling around, though I'd give the Solstice a very slight edge.    RIDE: In the MX-5, you feel the slightest road imperfections. The heavier Solstice cruises like a bigger car.    ROOFS: Both have manual tops, but that's no problem. Pontiac's disappears into the trunk, giving the Solstice a clean custom look, but more effort is required: you must raise the deck lid, unlatch the roof from inside, pull it back and latch it, and then close the trunk. The MX-5 roof looks neater when raised and can be lowered with one hand, even if the car is moving. Also, you can raise or lower the top while seated. It's a winner.    INTERIORS: The Solstice's sporty cockpit complements the body, but there are few gauges, a dearth of convenient storage spaces and ridiculous cup holders. The plastics, switches and knobs seem cheaper than Mazda's, with its brushed aluminum and glossy lacquer-look accents. The MX-5 has better storage and four (yes, four!) cup holders.    COMFORT: Both are snug for 6-footers, but the Pontiac seems more accommodating. Still, you can't adjust the Solstice's backrest while seated, and its power locks are annoying. I preferred the Solstice's seats","excerpt":"the MX-5's bottom cushions are thin. TRIP APPEAL: Mazda provides a wind blocker between the seats; Pontiac does not. Intrusions chop up the Solstice's trunk and the lowered roof takes up almost all of the space. The MX-5's trunk is small but useful, whether the top is up or down.    VALUE: Pontiac's base price is $1,000 lower, but you get less: fewer air bags, antilock brakes at extra cost, roll-up windows, fewer gears in some models. Premium fuel is recommended for both cars, but regular will do. In either case, expect to pay $25,000 or more for a car with the options you'll probably want.

But Karen Dunne-Maxim's brother Tim also suffered from a serious, sometimes fatal, illness: depression. And one day in 1972, at the age of 16, Tim ended his life by hurling himself in front of a train. \\n\\nIt took years for Ms. Dunne-Maxim, now a family therapist and an internationally recognized expert on suicide, to come to terms with her brother's suicide. Initially, she struggled with emotions common to survivors: numbness, disbelief and even anger. Fearful of the stigma attached to suicide, her family cloaked his death in silence, the norm at the time.\\n\\n\\"Only the close family knew all the facts,\\" she said. \\"There was an unspoken rule to keep the suicide a secret so, for instance, I met a cousin seven years later who thought my brother had died in a train accident","excerpt":"the myth was that it was an accident.\\"\\n\\nMs. Dunne-Maxim, also a registered nurse, enrolled in a graduate program in psychiatric nursing. Her \\"secret\\" remained hidden, until a supervisor noticed she was having trouble dealing with suicidal young patients and put her in touch with several other trainees who also had a relative who committed suicide. \\n\\nThe group's halting, torturous attempts to share long-repressed feelings led Ms. Dunne-Maxim and a colleague to found Survivors of Suicide, an education and support group for families of suicide victims. About 700 families have participated in the program, which is based at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey-Community Mental Health Center in Piscataway. \\n\\nMs. Dunne-Maxim is also coordinator of the Suicide Prevention Project, at the University of Medicine and Dentistry, which trains school personnel to identify and help students who are at risk of suicide and provide advice and assistance to schools where a suicide has occurred. \\n\\nNew Jersey is a nationally recognized pioneer in adolescent suicide prevention. In 1985, it became one of the first states in the country to pass legislation establishing a statewide youth suicide prevention program. \\n\\nMs. Dunne-Maxim, who has a master's degree in psychiatric nursing from Rutgers, has lectured throughout the United States and abroad, and was a co-editor of \\"Suicide and Its Aftermath: Understanding and Counseling Survivors\\" (W. W. Norton & Company, 1987). She and her husband, L. Daniel Maxim, the president of Everest Consulting Associates in Cranbury, have two daughters. \\n\\nQ. According to the New Jersey Department of Health, there were 613 reported suicides in the state in 1988, the most recent year for which statistics are available. Does that reflect the true numbers?\\n\\nA. The statisticians say that the reported suicides are really the tip of the iceberg, that there are many single-car accidents, drownings and drug overdoses that are not reported as suicide.\\n\\nQ. Do many people have misconceptions about why people commit suicide?\\n\\nA. Yes. I think people are mostly uneducated about the number of factors that combine and can lead to suicide. \\n\\nQ. For example?\\n\\nA. A newspaper headline saying \\"Pressure Drove Teen to Death.\\" People survive pressure all the time, and they don't kill themselves. People survive horrendous life circumstances, and they don't kill themselves. I am convinced that these people are more vulnerable; they are different, and they just cannot take the normal stresses that everybody else lives with.\\n\\nIt's a combination of factors: biological, psychological, sociological. There's such a need to understand why, people come up with the simplistic, one-sided explanation. We don't know enough about it. The big problem is that we have not had the same research effort in mental health and suicide that has been put forth in cancer, lung disease and heart disease. \\n\\nQ. Why?\\n\\nA. Because the families who were affected by lung, cancer and heart disease pushed for more research, pushed for legislation to address the problems, much more has been accomplished. Families who were affected by suicide and mental illness, because of the taboo and the stigma associated with those illnesses, were quiet; they didn't go out and say, \\"We need more money to fight this problem, to conquer suicide.\\" Now some families have begun to do that. It takes a lot of courage. \\n\\nWe also need the folk heroes to help us. We're just beginning to have celebrities who have lost someone to suicide, like Joan Rivers, Mariette Hartley and Paloma Picasso, join the fight. But there are many other celebrities who have lost someone to suicide and who could help change public attitudes, get more money for research. I believe we haven't been able to get them to join sort of a crusade because they're either walking around with exaggerated feelings of responsibility or the stigma. They hide the suicide. \\n\\nQ. What else needs to be done?\\n\\nA. Suicide is still the one evil that's not treated appropriately in the media. I'm very upset about a recent movie, \\"Thelma and Louise.\\" It is about two young women who are angry about some of the injustices that women have suffered from men. They go off on an adventure, end up committing some crimes and drive off a cliff rather than go back and face the consequences. It is a wonderful movie, with wonderful acting, beautiful cinematography, but it glamorizes suicide. The message is, \\"It takes courage to kill yourself.\\" \\n\\nQ. What are the warning signs that a teen-ager may be thinking of suicide?\\n\\nA. There are clusters of signs. The warnings signs really are signs of depression: changes in eating and sleeping patterns, changes in appetite, difficulty relating to peers, academic difficulties. One of the real toxic combinations is the use of alcohol or drugs to medicate depression, because alcohol and drugs just depress the central nervous system. You may feel free of stress for a little while, but you get extremely depressed in the aftermath. Depression with drug and alcohol use is a very lethal combination. \\n\\nQ. Then the warning signs are the same for teen-agers as for adults?\\n\\nA. Yes. The added worry with a young person is that they tend to be more impulsive. That's why families who have guns in the home need to be aware that young people are more impulsive, and if a weapon is easily available that they might use that weapon. \\n\\nQ. What should concerned parents do?\\n\\nA. They should talk to somebody at the school; it could be the guidance counselor or the child-study team. The schools see these kids for a long period of time, and they're usually worried. It's very important for parents to work cooperatively with the school system. Most of our referrals in the mental health center come from concerned, perceptive teachers, guidance counselors and psychologists who inform the parent and encourage the parent to bring the youngster for some psychological help. \\n\\nQ. Should parents attempt to talk to the child in addition to contacting the school?\\n\\nA. Yes. But developmentally, this is the age when the children are trying to separate from their parents, so it's quite normal for parents not to be the youngster's confidant. If the youngster won't talk to them, parents certainly shouldn't feel stopped by that. They need to go on and, if they're worried, get more information. Talk to the school, their clergy, call a hot line. Most counties have 24-hour hot lines. Don't be the lone ranger. Don't ignore it. It doesn't hurt to get advice. You're raising children in tough times. \\n\\nQ. What is it like to walk into a school after a student has committed suicide?\\n\\nA. One school administrator who had served in the Korean War said, \\"The suicide in our school system reminded me more of being in combat than anything else that I've ever experienced.\\" There's often hysteria, there's confusion, judgment is impaired. People who are in authority are hit psychologically themselves, often grieving over a student's death.\\n\\nThat's one of the reasons why a big part of our project is helping schools develop guidelines. The main thing that we want to do is to help them with the grief, help them to prevent copycat suicides. The school is often the island of support and stability after such an event, and by coaching the teachers and coaching the special service staff on how to handle the students, it's a very important mental health outreach project. \\n\\nQ. What problems do survivors of people who have committed suicide grapple with?\\n\\nA. The biggest problem is, I believe, unresolved grief, related to inadequate knowledge about suicide. They usually have exaggerated feelings of responsibility for the death, and this interferes with the normal grief resolution. And families who are touched by this receive less support. Even though there is less stigma attached to suicide than in the past, people always feel awkward. They don't know what to say.

But Mr. Cleaver has also worked capably in more conventional settings, and his own tastes appear to span the distance sometimes characterized as an inside-outside divide. He consciously conceived his ensemble Violet Hour as a stylistic bridge","excerpt":"the name of the band, as he explained last week over the phone, is ''a reference to that time commonly known as twilight, that time between day and night.'' The group's personnel -- the trumpeter Jeremy Pelt, the saxophonists Andrew Bishop and J. D. Allen (above, with Mr. Cleaver and Eric Revis), the pianist Ben Waltzer and the bassist Chris Lightcap -- suggests a diversity of approaches, and its repertory reflects Mr. Cleaver's long-form compositional interests. The day after their engagement at the Cornelia Street Café this weekend, they'll enter a recording studio to make what will probably be Mr. Cleaver's next album. Then on Wednesday, Mr. Cleaver will preside over a different project, Uncle June, at Barbès in Park Slope; his collaborators there will be the tenor saxophonist Tony Malaby, the violist Mat Maneri, the pianist Craig Taborn and the bassist Drew Gress. That's a lineup more expressive of Mr. Cleaver's usual scene, though it should be said that each of the musicians has happily pinballed between the supposed poles of tradition and experimentation. Given the effortlessness of Mr. Cleaver's own movement along that middle ground, it may turn out that his two ensembles have more commonalities than contrasts. Both will probably underscore the simple wisdom of Mr. Cleaver's observation that ''a lot of people find themselves in between, and it's a happy place, kind of a magical place to be.''

By Ray Monk. Illustrated. 654 pp. New York: The Free Press. $29.95.    Ludwig Wittgenstein was the greatest philosopher of the 20th century. Many books have been written about his philosophy. Ray Monk's \\"Ludwig Wittgenstein\\" is the first substantial biography of his whole life. It is not a book to which one would turn to learn about Wittgenstein's thought, but enough is said about the philosophical writings to make intelligible the story of the philosopher's life. And the story is well told","excerpt":"the narrative is vivid, clear, sympathetic and credible.   Wittgenstein's great-grandfather was a land agent named Moses Maier, who in 1808 took the name of his princely employers, the Wittgensteins. His father, Karl, a friend of Johannes Brahms, was the most acute industrialist in the Austrian steel industry; he made the family the Austrian equivalent of the Carnegies or Rothschilds. He had five sons and three daughters by a Roman Catholic wife, and baptized all of them into the Catholic faith. He set out to educate the sons in a very severe regime which would turn them into captains of industry. He did not succeed. Three of the sons committed suicide; the fourth, Paul, became (despite the loss of an arm in World War I) a concert pianist; the fifth, the youngest child, born in Vienna in 1889, was the philosopher.   Ludwig Wittgenstein attended the Realschule in Linz, where he was a contemporary of Adolf Hitler. He was a poor scholar, teased by his peers. At school he also lost his faith. The major intellectual influences on him in his youth, apart from the philosophical works of Schopenhauer, were the physicist Ludwig Boltzmann (suicide 1906) and the psychologist Otto Weininger (suicide 1903).   Mr. Monk believes that Weininger's bizarre book \\"Sex and Character\\" was of fundamental importance in shaping Wittgenstein's career. According to Weininger -- a homosexual -- all human beings are bisexual, a mixture of male and female. Woman is nothing but sexuality: every woman is a mixture of prostitute and mother. Men must choose between the masculine and feminine elements within themselves; the ideal for a man is to free himself from sex. \\"The choice that Weininger's theory offers is a bleak and terrible one indeed: genius or death,\\" says Mr. Monk. \\"If . . . one cannot free oneself from sensuality and earthly desires -- then one has no right to live at all.\\"   For Wittgenstein, to acquire genius became a categorical imperative. He once described Beethoven greeting a friend on completion of a new fugue: he \\"came to the door, looking as if he had been fighting the devil, and having eaten nothing for 36 hours because his cook and parlour-maid had been away from his rage. That's the sort of man to be.\\"   It was in Cambridge in 1911 that Wittgenstein first gave evidence of genius in philosophy, and it was Bertrand Russell who first recognized it. Wittgenstein was, Russell wrote, \\"perhaps the most perfect example I have ever known of genius as traditionally conceived, passionate, profound, intense, and dominating.\\" Russell was already well known as the author of powerful, original work in logic and mathematics; he soon realized that Wittgenstein's gifts were greater than his own, and he devoted himself with great generosity to their development. In 1912 he told Wittgenstein's sister, \\"We expect the next big step in philosophy to be taken by your brother.\\"   The expectation was fulfilled, but Wittgenstein's philosophical message was not given to the world until after World War I. During that war he served in the Austrian Army on the Eastern and Italian fronts, and much of the material that later appeared in his masterpiece, \\"Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus,\\" was written while on active service. At the front Wittgenstein showed conspicuous courage and was commended and decorated; he was also converted, by the reading of Tolstoy, to an intense though idiosyncratic Christianity. \\"Perhaps the nearness of death,\\" he wrote in his diary, \\"will bring me the light of life. May God enlighten me. I am a worm, but through God I become a man. God be with me. Amen.\\"   After the war, having inherited a share of his father's fortune, he found himself one of the wealthiest men in Europe. Within a month of returning from the army he gave all his money away. For some years he supported himself as a gardener or as a schoolmaster in rural Austrian schools. He believed, for a while, that he had already solved all the problems of philosophy in his \\"Tractatus,\\" which appeared (after great difficulty in finding a publisher) in German in 1921 and in English in 1922. The book quickly became famous; though it was itself metaphysical and almost mystical, as well as austerely logical, it was most admired by the anti-metaphysical positivists of the Vienna Circle.    It was at Vienna that Wittgenstein returned to the study of philosophy, when his career as a schoolmaster came to an unhappy end after allegations of cruelty to his pupils. Eventually he returned to Cambridge and during his years there in the 1930's he became the most influential teacher of philosophy in Britain. The philosophy he taught in this period differed from that published in the \\"Tractatus\\"; it was not presented in print until \\"Philosophical Investigations\\" was published posthumously in 1953.   After the Anschluss, Hitler's forced unification of Austria and Germany in 1938, Wittgenstein became a British citizen. During World War II he worked as a paramedic, and in 1947 he resigned his Cambridge chair. He continued to write philosophy and to communicate philosophical thoughts to close friends and disciples. After a period of solitary life in Ireland, he stayed in the houses of various friends in Oxford and Cambridge until his death in 1951 at the age of 62. He left a mass of philosophical papers, many of them still awaiting publication.   Wittgenstein's genius is patent to any philosopher who will take the time and trouble to come to grips with his profound but difficult writings. His life, as described by Mr. Monk, seems to have been a lonely and tragic one. He was often tormented by temptations to suicide, and was sometimes on the verge of mental illness. He regarded his life as a professor as \\"a living death,\\" and held many of his colleagues, in the various callings he pursued, in loathing and contempt. His only philosophical peer was Russell, and the relationship between the two soured after Wittgenstein's return to Cambridge. Many of his philosophical disciples loved him, but it was a love mixed strongly with fear.   Four times in his life, according to Mr. Monk, Wittgenstein fell deeply in love. Three of his loves were male and one female. (Sensational stories have been told of Wittgenstein's passion for rough homosexuals picked up in Vienna parks; Mr. Monk examines the evidence patiently and convincingly and concludes that any such encounters took place only in Wittgenstein's own fantasy.) David Pinsent, to whose memory the \\"Tractatus\\" was dedicated, accompanied Wittgenstein to Norway and Iceland in the prewar period; he was killed in 1918. Francis Skinner, who came up to Cambridge as a student in 1930, had an all-absorbing relationship with Wittgenstein in the 30's; and in 1946 Wittgenstein fell in love with a Cambridge medical student, Ben Richards, 40 years his junior.   MANY readers will be surprised to learn from Mr. Monk's book that there was a time when Wittgenstein had plans to marry. From 1926 to 1931 he had a friendship with a Swiss woman, Marguerite Respinger. For a period he wrote to her almost daily, and he sculpted a bust of her. An entry in his diary for 1930 reads: \\"Arrived back in Cambridge after the Easter vacation. In Vienna often with Marguerite. Easter Sunday with her in Neuwaldegg. For three hours we kissed each other a great deal and it was very nice.\\"   Once it became clear that Wittgenstein wanted to marry her, Marguerite drew back -- especially as it transpired that what the philosopher had in mind was a Platonic, childless union.   Faith in God was important to Wittgenstein; but his faith seems to have been a somber one. God was perhaps no more than Fate. If He was to be thought of as a person, it was solely as a severe judge. Yet Wittgenstein's last words were, \\"Tell  [ my friends ]  I've had a wonderful life.\\" Ray Monk's book has succeeded remarkably in portraying some of its wonders.    HE WELCOMED THE BOMB    Wittgenstein's hostility towards professional philosophy and his dislike of Cambridge remained constant throughout his academic career, but in the years . . . that followed the Second World War, they seemed to become fused with a kind of apocalyptic vision. . . .   What links this apocalyptic anxiety with his hostility to academic philosophy is his detestation of the power of science in our age, which on the one hand encouraged the philosopher's \\"craving for generality,\\" and on the other produced the atomic bomb. . . . He even welcomed the bomb, if only the fear of it could do something to diminish the reverence with which society regarded scientific progress. . . . The most pessimistic view, for him, was one which foresaw the triumph of science and technology: \\"Science and industry, and their progress, might turn out to be the most enduring thing in the modern world. Perhaps any speculation about a coming collapse of science and industry is . . . nothing but a dream; perhaps science and industry, having caused infinite misery in the process, will unite the world -- I mean condense it into a single unit, though one in which peace is the last thing that will find a home. Because science and industry do decide wars, or so it seems.\\"     From \\"Ludwig Wittgenstein.\\"     Give Him Genius or Give Him Death"},{"year":"1936","title":"Narrative of George Russell, ed by P L Brown An Australian Worthy","excerpt":"THE NARRATIVE OF GEORGE RUSSELL.

''The useful monotony of happiness'' is what's missing for Reta, a writer whose eldest daughter has taken to sitting and begging on a downtown street corner; Reta's response and the author's tone, measured and calm, are of greater interest than the withdrawal itself.

November 30, 2006, age 88, of Mamaroneck, NY, after a long and courageous battle with cancer. A 1991 inductee into the National Inventors Hall of Fame, Greene patented hundreds of inventions, many integral to modern aviation, including the stall prevention devices that are now essential safety equipment on all aircraft and have saved many thousands of lives. In 1946, he founded the Safe Flight Instrument Corporation in White Plains, NY, one of a very few early aviation companies still owned by its founding family. An aerodynamicist and expert pilot, Greene was a life member of the Society of Experimental Test Pilots and held many aviation records and awards. In 1981, he co-founded the Corporate Angel Network, a nonprofit that arranges free transportation to treatment for cancer patients by using the empty seats on corporate flights. To date, the organization has flown nearly 25,000 cancer patients to treatment centers throughout the U.S. An avid sailor, Greene advised several America's Cup syndicates and then bought the two-time winner Courageous to compete again in 1986. Sailing under the aegis of the Yale Corinthian Yacht Club, the only undergraduate sailing club ever to participate, the Courageous Syndicates 1986 run at the Cup spearheaded Greene's campaign to restore the Corinthian ideals of amateur sportsmanship to the competition, and more broadly, to team sports in general. Following the 1997 donation of Courageous to the Museum of Yachting in Newport, RI, the famed 12-meter was named Rhode Island's State Yacht. Leonard Greene experienced poverty as a youth during the Depression, and never forgot it. As a successful businessman, he implemented innovative employment policies, barring mandatory retirement age, actively recruiting the differently abled, and providing profit sharing at his own manufacturing facility. Seeking a broader forum and greater impact for his ideas, in 1974 he founded the Institute for SocioEconomic Studies, a nonpartisan think tank dedicated to enhancing economic and social opportunity and improving quality of life. The Institute provides a national forum for innovative insights and solutions to problems of economic development, social motivation, poverty, and urban regeneration and conducts research in these areas. Through the Institute, Greene advocated a revolutionary change in tax policy that would extend economic opportunity and incentives by transforming existing social welfare spending into a generous national tax rebate. In pursuit of these interests, he was a was a member of both the Special Committee on Welfare & Income Maintenance and the Council on Trends & Perspectives of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, as well as the Income Maintenance Committee of the Community Service Society and the Work Group on Welfare Reform of the Task Force on the New York City Fiscal Crisis. Greene was author of the books Free Enterprise without Poverty (Norton, 1981), The National Tax Rebate: A New America with Less Government (Regnery, 1998), and Inventorship: The Art of Innovation (Wiley, 2001). He was president of the Institute and active in its mission to the end. Greene graduated in 1938 from the City College of New York with a B.S. in Chemistry, and went on to receive the M.S. degree in Engineering, also from CCNY, before doing postgraduate work at the Guggenheim School of Aeronautics of New York University. He was awarded the degree of Doctor of Civil Law honoris causa by Pace University in 1977. Among his many other awards and honors are the Flight Safety Foundations Air Safety Award (1949 and 1981), Award for Meritorious Service (1981), and Allied Signal/Bendix Trophy Award for Aviation Safety (1999)","excerpt":"the National Business Aircraft Association's Pilot Safety Award (1961) and Award for Meritorious Service to Aviation (1996); the Private Sector Initiative Commendation of the President of the United States (1982 and 1984); the Foundation for Westchester Community College's Medallion Award for Distinguished Achievement in Business, Science and Humanitarianism; the Special Act Award of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; Aviation Week & Space Technology's Laurels Award in the Field of Electronics (1999) and Laureate Award for Lifetime Achievement as a Pioneer in Flight Safety, Performance and Innovation (2001); and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office's Contribution to American Innovation Award (2002). He was man of vision who not only imagined and developed new and better products and policies, but also cared deeply enough about the well being of others to dare to try to overturn the status quo and to leave the world a better place. Beyond his gifts for invention and innovation, perhaps his most salient quality was his capacity for enjoyment. He loved his work and his life, and brought to both a child like sense of fun and adventure that gave him a special bond with children, including his own. Born in 1918 in New York City to Max and Lyn (Furman) Greene, Leonard Greene was also proceeded in death by his siblings Helen and Elliot. On September 11, 2001, his son, Donald Freeman Greene, was killed in the terrorist attack on Unitied Flight 93.
