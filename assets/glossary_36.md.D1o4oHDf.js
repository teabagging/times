A few hardy travelers penetrated the anti-Western bureaucracy to visit the southern region, a land of rare wildlife, lakes and tropical ice-capped mountains. But the northern highlands, with their rich history of Christianity, remote rock churches and a culture untouched by the outside world, remained out of bounds. A devastating civil war that gathered steam after the coming to power of the Communist regime in 1974 and ended in May 1991, presented a practical obstacle. Beyond that, the hunger, poverty and repression rendered tourism an inappropriate idea. Yet those Americans who have experienced Ethiopia -- humanitarian workers, diplomats, writers and even businessmen -- have often developed a lasting affinity with a people and culture that unlike the rest of Africa refused to succumb to European colonialism.   The curtain lifted on Ethiopia when the Marxist regime collapsed and war between the Government and rebels based in Tigre province came to an end. Since then a small trickle of visitors, which the Ethiopians hope will grow in numbers, have ventured through what the Ethiopians call the historic route.

(Anchor, $13.) A young Canadian doctor with no nautical training, fresh from an army stint and feeling rudderless, tells of how he refreshed his soul by sailing in a 37-foot boat from British Columbia to Tahiti and back. Patterson, at right, didn't run into any killer sharks or perfect storms, but he came up with ''a delightful, finely written and, in the end, wise book,'' Christopher Buckley wrote here in 2000. Monsters of the Sea, by Richard Ellis (Lyons, $22.95), is a historical survey of mermaids, giant squids, sea serpents and other spooky creatures -- both real and mythological -- that lurk in the deep. In 1994 our reviewer, Janet Lembke, admired Ellis's ''insatiable curiosity'' and ''wry sense of humor.'' In Search of Moby Dick: Quest for the White Whale, by Tim Severin (Da Capo, $13.50), is the colorful account of how the author roamed the South Pacific with whale hunters to determine whether Ahab's nemesis ever existed and whether similar whales exist today. Last year in these pages, W. Jeffrey Bolster called this an ''original, audacious and exuberant'' blend of ''imagination, action and myth.''    LIGHTNING ON THE SUN, by Robert Bingham. (Anchor, $13.) This first novel (the author died in 1999 at the age of 33 of an apparent heroin overdose) is a black comedy about a pair of privileged young Americans who cook up a scheme involving fraud, heroin and, worst of all, Cambodian drug lords. Bingham was ''funny, mordant and quick,'' Stacey D'Erasmo said here last year. ''Good satirists are hard to find, and a true gift for darkness is rare.''    STERN MEN, by Elizabeth Gilbert. (Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $13.) The smart, observant heroine of this first novel passes up college to return home to Maine, where she struggles to inject some cooperative spirit into the hostilities dividing the hard-drinking, hard-loving lobstermen on two isolated islands. Last year in these pages, Sena Jeter Naslund praised the book's ''vividness and toughness'' and said that the ''metaphoric writing flashes with welcome brilliance.''    OUT FOR GOOD: The Struggle to Build a Gay Rights Movement in America, by Dudley Clendinen and Adam Nagourney. (Touchstone/Simon & Schuster, $18.) Even though this history of gay political activism begins with the Stonewall uprising in 1969 and effectively ends in 1987, the authors (a former editorial writer and a reporter for The New York Times) ''have done yeomen's work in researching important stories,'' David J. Garrow wrote here in 1999.    PURPLE CANE ROAD, by James Lee Burke. (Dell, $7.50.) The author's durable hero, the Louisiana sheriff's deputy Dave Robicheaux, gets a blast from his past when a long-buried domestic murder case springs to life and two corrupt cops who might have killed his mother turn up. ''Nobody writes about the bad old days down South like James Lee Burke,'' Marilyn Stasio said here last year.    A PLACE IN THE COUNTRY, by Laura Shaine Cunningham. (Riverhead, $13.) The Manhattan-born, Bronx-raised author describes her lifelong bucolic longings and her 18 years of paradise down on the farm in New York State, where her livestock are fat and lazy, and her vegetable garden is a salad bar for the local wildlife. ''She's a sharp and witty writer'' who ''makes it delightfully clear that the horrors of the simple life, from snakes to nasty neighbors, are right up front with the bliss,'' Laura Shapiro wrote in the Book Review last year.    DRESSING UP FOR THE CARNIVAL, by Carol Shields. (Penguin, $13.) Many of the stories in this collection celebrate the hidden qualities of commonplace items like keys, a coffee pot and a straw hat, and the importance of seemingly unimportant things. The result is ''a glittering sample case'' of work by ''a witty, mercurial, playful writer,'' David Willis McCullough said here last year.    THE FLY-TRUFFLER, by Gustaf Sobin. (Norton, $12.) In a melancholy tale by a French poet, a grieving Proven&#231","excerpt":"al widower discovers that the black truffles he hunts for on his rambling estate bring on powerful dreams of his dead wife. ''The plot is a bit frail, but sentence by sentence, this slight, swift novel is precise, startling and lovely,'' Jennifer Reese wrote here in 2000.    COMMAND PERFORMANCE: An Actress in the Theater of Politics, by Jane Alexander. (Da Capo, $16.50.) The actress recalls her four years as chairwoman of the National Endowment for the Arts and her encounters with conservative politicians.

But while the Genie looks the same, here it is not Mr. Williams's manic, movie-stealing voice that booms out, \\"He's big, he's blue, he's back!\\" but that of Dan Castellaneta, better known as the voice of Homer Simpson.    There are other differences that mark the sequel as a pale \\"Aladdin\\" wannabe. The four new songs are not by Alan Menken with Howard Ashman or Tim Rice, but by a variety of unfamous, uneven composers. And \\"The Return of Jafar\\" was produced by Walt Disney Television Animation, which means that the animation looks sophisticated by television standards, but is nothing next to the sumptuous, elaborate world created for the film.

Mr. Alaia was also influenced by the clothing of Asia, producing loose, liquid clothes that will be in stores for the spring-summer selling season.

But whenever this famous Paris designer's clothes make it to New York stores, they are snapped up by waiting customers.   There are two good reasons why Alaia commands such a devoted fan club. Serious followers of fashion know that he has an uncanny way of picking up on a style trend at least a season before the rest. The other is pure sex appeal. Both these qualities are obvious in the new Alaias. Fitting as snugly as plaster to the ribs and waist, the jackets and coats flare out over the hips in princess lines. They evoke late-1930's and 40's silhouettes. Yet, they are as curvy as all get out, calling attention to the bosom and hips.

But with the voters' rejection earlier this month of the $1.975 billion Environmental Quality Bond Act, nearly half of which was to be spent on land acquisition, the state has no secure source of funds with which to buy such properties. And in the midst of the current financial straits -- legislative leaders will confer here this week to consider Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's call for up to 10,000 layoffs of state workers and sharp cuts in aid to local governments -- the odds that much money will be found in the general budget look slim.

There's a lot to criticize, starting with the Legislature's bloated $168 million budget. Unlike Congress, which at least provides a detailed breakdown, the leaders of the perk-ridden Assembly and Senate provide only a grudging outline to justify their legislative budget, the highest in the country.
