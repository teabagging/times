But Mr. Hopkins's film is no month in the country, despite the elaborate effort behind this directorial debut. It has the bad luck to be overshadowed in almost every regard by memories of Louis Malle's \\"Vanya on 42d Street,\\" which set such a spare and knowing standard for Chekhov productions on screen. \\"August\\" offers a lifeless but overproduced version that is enhanced by every possible prop, including a Welsh quarry where prospective patients for Dr. Lloyd (Gawn Grainger) can be gruesomely injured. Elsewhere, \\"August\\" supplies all the  rumpled linen costumes and fussy antiques any film could bear.

More than 20 years ago, another French movie, called ''Sundays and Cyb ele'' in this country, turned the convention shockingly on its head.   The same is true for ''La Petite Sir ene,'' which opens next Friday at the Metro Cinema. Isabelle, a 14-year-old Parisian girl lost in fantasy in her candlelit, fabric-swathed bedroom, becomes obsessed with Georges, a 40- year-old garage mechanic. What at first seems a light comedy about an enchanting teen-ager's crush on an amiable older man gradually grows darker and more complicated - a tale of how someone just emerged from childhood can enmesh a mature man in a tragic and deadly game.","excerpt":"Variation on a theme from France."},{"year":"1964","title":"A Krock on how state came to hold primary earlier than other states In The Nation","excerpt":"Variation on a Theme of General Forrest"},{"year":"1995","title":"The following article is based on reporting by Richard L.

Beginning with Milton Berle and ''Your Shows of Shows'' and ''The Ed Sullivan Show'' in the earliest days of television, it was king of the schedule, pouring forth a stream of whacky sketches and musical production numbers. At one time or another, the weekly series were headed by such superstars as Judy Garland or Frank Sinatra, and by such emerging talents as Lily Tomlin and Richard Pryor. But, perhaps because of over-saturation, the comedy-variety flow gradually became a trickle. Dean Martin and Flip Wilson were among the last entertainers to get good runs out of the format. Today the viewer is left with Barbara Mandrell and, stretching a point, ''Real People.''   Behind the scenes, though, irrepressible producers are still busy concocting what they hope will be irresistible comedy-variety ideas.  One such optimist is George Schlatter, whose credits range from ''Laugh-In,'' which had a good deal to do with making Miss Tomlin a star, to the aforementioned ''Real People,'' which avoids the expense and headaches of dealing with professional performers by turning the ordinary man or woman in the street into an entertainer.
