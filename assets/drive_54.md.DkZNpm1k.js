Born Andras Grof, he fled Hungary after the Soviet invasion in 1956, arriving in New York with little money or English. Undaunted, he worked and studied his way through City College of New York to graduate near the top of his class and then left for California.   In 1967, Mr. Grove joined a fledgling Silicon Valley company called Intel as president. After years of success, Intel was in trouble in the mid-1980's. Under Mr. Grove, the company gulped hard, pulled out of the memory-chip business and bet its future on microprocessors.

But the predilection of the director, producer and scenarist for the unusual in mood, background music and characterization makes this chase more confusing than suspenseful.The confusion is due largely to their studied effort to interpret visually the working of a war-shocked mind, that of Robert Cummings. The audience is unaware of his condition when the veteran gets a job as a chauffeur with a Miami racket boss. The latter, it turns out, is a sadist who has been keeping his wife a prisoner.Chauffeur and captive mistress flee to Havana, where the lady is mysteriously stabbed and killed. Terror follows upon terror as Cummings, the suspect, escapes from the police until he, too, is shot and killed. All the foregoing horrors, however, are only a nightmare of Cummings' ailing brain. But he manages really to flee with the lady through somewhat parallel situations.Amid this welter of dreams, however, are some solid and entertaining portrayals. Count as best among these that of Steve Cochran, who has been seen in \\"The Kid from Brooklyn\\" and \\"Wonder Man.\\" Mr. Cochran, who plays the sadistic gang chief, is a dark, handsome, suave and brooding ruffian, who is not averse to clipping either his wife or manicurist on the jaw. Peter Lorre is excellent as his sardonic sidekick. Michele Morgan, who plays the distraught wife, has little to do except appear plaintive. Robert Cummings as the harried hero with an \\"anxiety neurosis,\\" turns in a restrained and convincing performance. \\"The Chase,\\" however, is neither restrained nor convincing.

Instead of inspiring them to go on struggling, however, their dreams have a way of pointing up the disparity between their expectations and their lives: The man who promises his bride that he will become a famous engineer and show her the world ends up working at a menial job at Cape Canaveral, entertaining his children with souped-up stories about his role in the space program. The beautiful Panamanian girl who plans on becoming a film star ends up as an anonymous barfly, passing the days with American servicemen.

California's clean-cut Rick Dees was recruited to be a late-night talk-show host. It didn't work. New York's scruffy Howard Stern, a sort of walking testament to 1960's excess, was given an endearingly ratty showcase on local station WWOR. That didn't work either, despite some memorable moments when Mr. Stern descended upon a somewhat confused Bob Hope for an impromptu interview.    Now, squinting nervously at a brand new season, NBC has found Mark Thompson and Brian Phelps, two D.J.'s from Los Angeles. Like the rest of their breed, Mark and Brian seem to be eternal man-boys, quite content to spend the greater part of their lives in a state of blissful post-adolescence. Shucks, for most men these days, it's the American way. Taking their cue from Walter Mitty, the two apparently irrepressible cutups will each week put themselves in extraordinary situations, things like white-water rafting or swinging on a circus trapeze.
