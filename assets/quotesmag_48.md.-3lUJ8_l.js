The silent-film star's dreamy, languid gaze appears on screens mounted in a set resembling the lobby of a 1920's movie theater. A voice, ostensibly from an early Victrola, begins to sing in the style of Rudy Vallee, mourning the passing of the screen idol. The pop lyrics are first overlaid with the sound of a male chorus intoning the Latin Requiem, then with the vocalizing of a soprano, and finally, with loving declarations by a woman in black. There are five singing lines going at once in clashing keys and styles.   It is a daring way to open an opera, even for someone as lyrically gifted as Mr. Argento. And for all the awkwardness of the first night's performance of this opening gambit, it was clear that it was meant to suggest momentous grandeur, religious pomp, pop sentimentality and personal devotion, all combined into a contradictory whole. There is somebody of great importance lying in state (or so the music proclaims), whose impact was profound. \\"The Dream of Valentino,\\" which will be performed until Feb. 13, promises to explain how and why.

In an important case decided at the end of its 1984-85 term, the United States Supreme Court gave a go-ahead to forum shopping in the class action context.

After studying recordings and soaking up the music in villages, Muszikas charges into traditional music with the virtuosity it demands and the spunk it thrives on.    Muszikas is a string band, with fiddle, string bass and three kontras, three-stringed violas that supply chords and rhythm. Its first selection, lasting about 25 minutes, was the kind of rhapsodic outpouring of melody that Liszt tried to approximate, growing from slow, introspective melodies to speeding dance tunes, every phrase crammed with ornamentation above the gruff chords of the bowed bass and kontras.

The trumpet is a dangerous creature to bring into the china shop of chamber music, but Mr. Ewazen cannily exploits the instrument's lyric side, basing his idiom on Copland's Americana style.

But the same night, Miller Theater offers almost irresistible competition: as part of the hall's important Composer Portraits series, URSULA OPPENS and MARILYN NONKEN are sharing a program of piano music by Frederic Rzewski, including his extraordinary set of variations on ''The People United Will Never Be Defeated!'' and a new one on an Irish antiwar melody, ''Bring Them Home'' (8 p.m., Broadway and 116th Street, 212-854-7799). This afternoon, early-music fans will want to catch the medieval-music specialists SEQUENTIA in ''Lost Songs of a Rhineland Harper,'' a program of 10th- and 11th-century songs, at Music Before 1800 (4 p.m., Corpus Christi Church, 529 West 121st Street, Morningside Heights, 212-666-9266).

There are, of course, a few organizations that see an opportunity here, not least among them the NEW YORK CITY OPERA, which is beating all the other major organizations to the punch -- and giving itself a few weeks virtually clear of competition -- by opening its season on Wednesday.    Its opening-night drawing card is a new production of ''CAPRICCIO,'' Strauss's 15th and last opera. This warm-hued neo-Classical gem explores a question that has been at the heart of operatic debate since the form was created at the turn of the 17th century: whether the music or the words are primary. The production, by the inventive director STEPHEN LAWLESS, stars PAMELA ARMSTRONG as the Countess Madeleine, with RYAN MacPHERSON as the composer Flamand and MEL ULRICH as the poet Olivier, the rivals for the countess's affections. The cast also includes ERIC HALFVARSON, CLAIRE POWELL, GEORGE MOSLEY, LISA SAFFER and BARRY BANKS, and GEORGE MANAHAN conducts.

Institute. 7:30 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3303, $50.And it's a big week for PLÁCIDO DOMINGO, the tenor turned conductor turned impresario. Saturday is the opening of the season of the WASHINGTON OPERA, one of the two opera companies he directs, at the Kennedy Center: Verdi's ''VESPRI SICILIANI'' is the piece, the cast includes MARIA GULEGHINA, and Maestro Domingo conducts. 7 p.m., the Kennedy Center, (202)295-4200. But on Tuesday, Mr. Domingo will already have shown his vocal skills, at least virtually: it's the United States release date of his studio recording of ''TRISTAN UND ISOLDE,'' a very fine recording on EMI. THE WEEK AHEAD: Sept. 11-Sept. 17","excerpt":"CLASSICAL MUSIC"},{"year":"2005","title":"As the story goes, the jazz-loving über-soprano RENÉE FLEMING, who just released a new crossover album, was checking out the pianist BRAD MEHLDAU'S show at the VILLAGE VANGUARD a few years ago when she bumped into none other than ROBERT HARTH, who was then the executive director of CARNEGIE HALL. The two classical Mehldau fans started conspiring, and it led to Carnegie's commissioning the pianist to write for Ms. Fleming a pair of song cycles, which will both be unveiled tonight at Zankel Hall. It should be interesting to see what the omnivorous Mr. Mehldau has created for this foray into classical territory. He describes the music -- through-composed settings of poetry by RAINER MARIA RILKE and LOUISE BOGAN -- as drawing from a kaleidoscope of influences: SCHUMANN and FAURÉ, MESSIAEN and PROKOFIEV, singer-songwriters like NICK DRAKE and JONI MITCHELL, pop and jazz. Could be too much or a brilliant cocktail. 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, (212)247-7800.    On the other end of the spectrum, you won't find many Joni Mitchell references tonight at the KNITTING FACTORY, where the dependable DA CAPO CHAMBER PLAYERS are performing contemporary music for acoustic instruments and tape including Steve Reich's mellow musings for many clarinets in ''NEW YORK COUNTERPOINT'' as well as MARIO DAVIDOVSKY'S more jagged and nervy ''SYNCHRONISMS NO. 6,'' which won the Pulitzer Prize in 1971. 7:30 p.m.,Knitting Factory, (212)219-3006.    The Met's season is still on, but adventurous opera fans might like to know that this afternoon is the last performance of a BROOKLYN COLLEGE production of BRECHT and WEILL'S immortal ''THREEPENNY OPERA.'' 2 p.m., Brooklyn Center for the Performing Arts, (718)951-4500. And finally, chamber music devotees and newcomers can take in a rendition of BRAHMS'S glorious G-MAJOR VIOLA QUINTET -- some of the richest small ensemble music he ever wrote -- with JONATHAN CARNEY joining the AMERICAN STRING QUARTET on Saturday night at BARGEMUSIC, the intimate floating concert hall that offers great views of the city. Waves included. 7:30 p.m. Fulton Ferry Landing next to the Brooklyn Bridge, (718)624-2083.

For those who missed concerts from James Levine's first season as music director of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, here is a chance to catch up. On Sunday the orchestra plays works by JOHN HARBISON and CHARLES WUORINEN, two of the most important living American composers and favorites of Mr. Levine. The Boston Symphony commissioned the pieces, Mr. Wuorinen's Fourth Piano Concerto and Mr. Harbison's ''Darkbloom: Overture for an Imagined Opera,'' and gave their premieres last season.    The two composers have parallel biographies: both were born in 1938, won Pulitzer Prizes and MacArthur ''genius'' grants, and are connected to the academy. But hearing these two pieces together counts as a highly compressed mini-survey of two disparate American composing trends. Mr. Wuorinen is a pillar of the atonal school founded by Schoenberg, although his music has grown in accessibility. Mr. Harbison's style is rooted more in traditional tonality, what in the past might have been called neo-Romantic.    Mr. Wuorinen's concerto, to be played by the pianist PETER SERKIN, is complex, rigorous and intense. Mr. Harbison's overture is a 10-minute piece knitting together fragments of an aborted opera based on Nabokov's ''Lolita.'' Mr. Harbison has said he abandoned the opera after the pedophilia scandal broke out in the Roman Catholic Church.    Mr. Levine and the Bostonians can also be heard traversing the four Brahms symphonies, two on Friday and two on Saturday. Tanglewood, Lenox, Mass., (888)266-1200.    Other events of note this week are a performance of Bach's B-minor Mass at CARAMOOR on Sunday, with GEORGE STEEL conducting the VOX VOCAL ENSEMBLE and the ORCHESTRA OF ST. LUKE'S. Katonah, N.Y., (914)232-1252 or www.caramoor.org. Pianists including URSULA OPPENS and EARL WILD will be performing through the week at a keyboard festival at the MANNES COLLEGE OF MUSIC. 150 West 85th Street, Manhattan, (212) 580-0210.   THE WEEK AHEAD: July 17 -- July 23","excerpt":"CLASSICAL MUSIC"},{"year":"2005","title":"The MOSTLY MOZART FESTIVAL is in full swing, with attractive prime-time events tomorrow through Saturday. But not to be overlooked are the delectably intimate late-night concerts of a type introduced last summer, in a passable imitation of a nightclub. The pianists EMANUEL AX (Tuesday and Wednesday) and JEAN-YVES THIBAUDET (Friday) moonlight after their concerto performances in Avery Fisher Hall, and EMMA BELL, a soprano, joins Mr. Ax on Tuesday. Early-music fanciers will be particularly interested in the appearance of the harpsichordist EMMANUELLE HAÏM and members of her ensemble, LE CONCERT D'ASTRÉE, on Saturday, the night before their larger-scale appearance at Alice Tully Hall. Ms. Haïm and company gained wide attention last year with superb recordings of Monteverdi's ''Orfeo'' and Purcell's ''Dido and Aeneas.'' Here they play works of Jean-Marie Leclair and Bach. 10:30 p.m., Kaplan Penthouse, Lincoln Center (212)721-6500.    The BOSTON SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA carries on business more or less as usual at the TANGLEWOOD FESTIVAL, conducted by CHARLES DUTOIT, INGO METZMACHER and SIR NEVILLE MARRINER. But the immensely talented young fellows of the Tanglewood Music Center will vie for center stage beginning on Thursday in the 2005 FESTIVAL OF CONTEMPORARY MUSIC, directed by the composer JOHN HARBISON. The opening concert, with Mr. Metzmacher, as one of the conductors, offers works by Elliott Carter, Pierre Boulez, Luigi Dallapiccola and Sir Harrison Birtwistle. The weekend's concerts rise to a climax on Sunday night with an appearance by a ringer, the crack chamber ensemble EIGHTH BLACKBIRD. Thursday and next Sunday at 8.30 p.m., Seiji Ozawa Hall, Tanglewood, Lenox, Mass. (413)637-5165.    The Bard Music Festival, two weekends of music and talk, doesn't begin until Aug. 12. But its subject this year is Copland, and the BARD SUMMERSCAPE tees it up beginning on Thursday, with Copland's rustic opera ''THE TENDER LAND.''

On its latest recording, ''Acoustica'' (Cantaloupe), the group performs works by the techno composer Aphex Twin in arrangements for mostly acoustic instruments, including the normal orchestral ones plus curtain rods, cocktail stirrers and other exotica. These fresh, quirky arrangements are the centerpieces of the ensemble's LINCOLN CENTER FESTIVAL program, ''UNREMIXED.'' Sunday at 9 p.m., the Allen Room at the Time Warner Center, Columbus Circle, (212)721-6500.    For fans of more traditional programs, the MOSTLY MOZART FESTIVAL gets under way on Thursday. LOUIS LANGRÉE has made the freelance festival orchestra into a cohesive unit these last couple of summers, and for the opening concert he has two soloists on hand -- the soprano RENÉE FLEMING and the pianist STEPHEN HOUGH. The performance aside, what everyone will be wondering about is whether the new stage arrangement -- the orchestra will be on an extension thrust into the audience, and listeners will be seated all around it -- will be an acoustical improvement. It had better be: the New York Philharmonic is adopting this configuration next season. Thursday at 8, Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212)721-6500.    There are also several inviting performances at the MANNES COLLEGE OF MUSIC, which is offering its annual INTERNATIONAL KEYBOARD INSTITUTE AND FESTIVAL through July 31. LESLIE HOWARD, an incomparable Liszt player, plays to his strengths in a program that includes several of Liszt's opera paraphrases, including a few rarities (Tuesday at 8). And MELVYN TAN, an early-music specialist, plays sonatas by Mozart, Beethoven and Schubert (Wednesday at 8). 150 West 85th Street, Manhattan, (212)580-0210, extension 4858.

This week offers three no-charge performances that have a bit more weight than the usual pleasant trifles of the summer season. Consider two of them a Memorial Day weekend reward for those staying in town.    On Memorial Day, the NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC gives its annual free concert at the CATHEDRAL CHURCH OF ST. JOHN THE DIVINE, with the assistant conductor XIAN ZHANG on the podium. The orchestra will play the ''ROMEO AND JULIET'' FANTASY-OVERTURE of Tchaikovsky and Rimsky-Korsakov's ''SCHEHERAZADE,'' whose swirling melodies may just swirl into oblivion in the cathedral's cavernous interior. 8 p.m., Amsterdam Avenue at 112th Street, Morningside Heights, (212)875-5709.    In some quarters, Memorial Day signals the start of beach season. So water may be on your mind. Enter TAN DUN. This composer specializes in watery sonorities, be they splashes, drips or gurgles. On Wednesday, he leads a free performance of his ''WATER PASSION AFTER ST. MATTHEW,'' at PIER 17 at the South Street Seaport. Mr. Dun tells the Gospel story through chanting, grunting, loud declamations, percussion playing and aqueous sounds. ''Water Passion'' was commissioned in 2000 by the International Bach Academy of Stuttgart, Germany, to commemorate the 250th anniversary of Bach's death.    Gratis concerts, of course, are nothing new for one of the most welcome new series in New York, the FREE FOR ALL AT TOWN HALL programs. The latest in the sequence -- which has included performances by Anne-Sofie von Otter and Peter Serkin -- will be an ANDRÉ WATTS concert on Sunday. The pianist brings a first half of Beethoven, anchored by the ''APPASSIONATA'' sonata, and a grab-bag second half -- doses of Ravel, Chopin, Liszt and Debussy. 5 p.m., Town Hall, 123 W. 43rd St., Midtown, (212)707-8787.    On the ticket-buying side, the PHILIP GLASS ENSEMBLE is presenting the composer's film music trilogy in consecutive evenings starting Thursday at the ROSE THEATER. The titles are ''KOYAANISQATSI'' (''Life Out of Balance''), ''NAQOYQATSI'' (''War as a Way of Life'') and ''POWAQQATSI'' (''Life in Transformation''). 8 p.m., Broadway at 60th Street, (212)721-6500.

The Met, having turned over its house to the American Ballet Theater, is offering al fresco opera, but of course there's a tradeoff: you don't get the company's opulent sets, but the performances are free, and the charge the singers get from seeing a park filled with listeners often finds its way into the music.    The run begins at CENTRAL PARK'S GREAT LAWN on Tuesday, when APRILE MILLO sings the title role of Puccini's ''TOSCA,'' joined by FRANCISCO CASANOVA as Cavaradossi and JAMES MORRIS as Scarpia.

If you have time left over from ''AINADAMAR,'' which begins Lincoln Center's monthlong festival of music by Osvaldo Golijov on Sunday at the Rose Theater, and the BERLIN PHILHARMONIC's four concerts at Carnegie Hall from Wednesday to Saturday, there is the start of the Juilliard School's annual ''FOCUS!'' festival of contemporary music on Friday. And above all, there is MOZART, everywhere, in connection with the 250th anniversary of his birth on Friday.    The METROPOLITAN OPERA does its Mozart bit with ''DIE ZAUBERFLÖTE'' on Tuesday and Friday and ''COSÌ FAN TUTTE'' on Wednesday and Saturday. The NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC begins its ''MAGIC OF MOZART'' festival on Thursday, with LORIN MAAZEL conducting Symphonies Nos. 28 and 35 and other works. The NEW JERSEY SYMPHONY concludes its ''MANY FACES OF MOZART'' festival on Jan. 29, with VLADIMIR FELTSMAN conducting and playing piano and fortepiano. On Friday the CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY OF LINCOLN CENTER begins its Mozart series at Alice Tully Hall, and the SHANGHAI STRING QUARTET offers a Mozart program at the CUNY Graduate Center. And on Saturday the TOKYO STRING QUARTET has another at the 92nd Street Y.    Yet perhaps the most imposing Mozart events this week are two concerts by the ORCHESTRE RÉVOLUTIONNAIRE ET ROMANTIQUE, conducted by JOHN ELIOT GARDINER, at Avery Fisher Hall The programs evoke not so much Mozart's birth as his later years, with the C minor Mass and the Requiem (with the MONTEVERDI CHOIR) on Sunday, and the last three symphonies on Monday. But the performances are sure to be highly charged, and to make for one of the truly memorable events in an overstuffed Mozart year.

On Thursday night, for example, the YING QUARTET, a dynamic ensemble of young sibling string players, in the midst of its fifth and last season in residence, presents an adventurous program. The concert stands out all the more because the first week of January is typically a slow time in the classical music season.    The quartet will present the New York premiere of TOD MACHOVER's '' but not simpler ,'' which alternates movements played traditionally with electronically generated interludes. Though Mr. Machover, a professor of music and media at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has a sophisticated knowledge of electronic resources, he brings a childlike enthusiasm to his multimedia experiments. The Ying Quartet's eclectic program will include works by ELLIOTT CARTER, the Renaissance master William Byrd, Beethoven, the Beatles and that pioneer of musical invention and experimental instruments, JOHN CAGE. 7:30 p.m., Leonard Nimoy Thalia, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400.    If this concert sounds too out there, , you can always try the Metropolitan Opera's candy-store-colored production of Donizetti's comedy ''L'Elisir d'Amore,'' which opens on Monday night. The delightful story concerns a painfully shy Tuscan village bumpkin who overcomes his romantic timidity thanks to a roving quack, who sells him a miracle love potion (actually just a bottle of wine). The cast stars the ardent tenor RAMÓN VARGAS and the golden-voiced soprano RUTH ANN SWENSON. The show may not be cutting edge, but it should be enjoyable.

First, JAMES EHNES, a polished Canadian player who has made a strong impression lately, turns his hand to the sumptuous, high-drama concerto that William Walton wrote for Heifetz in 1939, and that isn't played as often as it deserves to be. The program, conducted by LORIN MAAZEL, includes Wagner's ''Flying Dutchman'' Overture and the Dvorak Seventh Symphony. Tuesday at 7:30 p.m. at Avery Fisher Hall, (212) 721-6500.    A few days later, JOSHUA BELL joins the Philharmonic and the superb British conductor JONATHAN NOTT to play John Corigliano's ''Red Violin'' Concerto, a 2003 work composed for Mr. Bell, using themes from Mr. Corigliano's score for the film ''The Red Violin.'' Mr. Nott, who gave dazzling new-music performances in New York last spring with the Paris-based Ensemble Intercontemporain, is also conducting Strauss's ''Alpine Symphony.'' Thursday at 7:30 p.m. and Saturday at 8 p.m. at Avery Fisher Hall.    JAMES LEVINE's Carnegie Hall concerts with the MET ORCHESTRA usually show this ensemble's considerable strengths in music from well outside the opera house. This time, the program keeps the musicians close to their home turf. Still, the program is inviting: with RENÉE FLEMING and JULIEN ROBBINS as the soloists, it includes the ''Letter Scene'' from Tchaikovsky's ''Eugene Onegin,'' the closing monologue from Strauss's ''Capriccio'' and Berg's ''Altenberg Lieder.'' For good measure -- and because these concert are, after all, the orchestra's moments in the sun -- Mr. Levine is also offering Tchaikovsky's ''Romeo and Juliet Fantasy Overture'' and the Overture and Bacchanale from Wagner's ''Tannhäuser.''

The Quartet smoothly masters old ideas: stretched tonality, imitations of previous forms, studious use of imitative counterpoint and even some impudent use of different meters and speeds playing against one another.  But imbedded in these textures is the signature that was to be read more clearly in just a few years. Popular dance rhythms and balladlike melodies are among them.

They sell for about $1.69 for 14 ounces, $2.60 for 26 ounces. They are among the best of the jarred pasta sauces.   Similar in concept and execution are Progresso's New Authentic Pasta Sauces, also made free of preservatives and with quality ingredients such as olive oil, sausage, herbs and Italian-style cheeses. The tomato-based bolognese (with meat), sausage and peppers containing big chunks of sausage, and well-seasoned marinara sauces are more appealing than the thick cream-based Alfredo, carbonara and seafood, but even these have good flavor. Mealy bits of clam made the white clam sauce unacceptable. The suggested retail prices for these sauces are $1.79 to $2.49 for 12 ounces at most area supermarket chains.

It includes paintings, sculptures and photographs by 26 artists, matched in pairs that have some visual relationship, as in the examples cited above.

(Anchor, $13.) Ryan Bingham, this novel's troubled hero, is a career transition counselor (which means he crisscrosses the country firing people) who is desperately trying to amass one million frequent flier miles before he leaves or is himself downsized. A denizen of ''Airworld,'' a parallel universe with its own language, culture and architecture, Bingham ''is as original and cool a character to come along in American fiction in a while,'' Christopher Buckley wrote here in 2001. ''Kirn is such a sharp writer he gives your brain paper cuts.''    FIVE POINTS: The 19th-Century New York City Neighborhood That Invented Tap Dance, Stole Elections, and Became the World's Most Notorious Slum, by Tyler Anbinder. (Plume, $16.) America's first real ghetto, the Five Points in Lower Manhattan, is barely remembered today, but it was a haven for immigrants and the poor that produced a lively popular culture despite its squalor. Last year our reviewer, Kevin Baker, found this ''a careful, intelligent and sympathetic history on a neglected subject.''    BABE IN PARADISE, by Marisa Silver. (Norton, $13.95.) In this disquieting first collection of short stories, set in the arid sprawl of Los Angeles, characters who hover on the periphery of fame and wealth find themselves stung by addiction, robbery, carjacking and other unexpected miseries. Silver ''is a writer with a keen eye for alienation, and an ability to pinpoint the surprising ways that even the most disaffected among us are brought together, if only provisionally,'' Bernard Cooper said here last year.    THE DIARIES OF KENNETH TYNAN. Edited by John Lahr. (Bloomsbury, $16.95.) This selection of diary entries from the renowned journalist and theater critic's final decade (he died in 1980 at the age of 53) display flashes of ebullience and grim humor, even as they record his sorry decline into disease, debt and disappointment. Last year in the Book Review, Geoffrey Wheatcroft said the volume ''contains a number of scintillatingly witty and clever passages . . . yet remains one of the most depressing books I have read for a long time.''    THE CEO OF THE SOFA, by P. J. O'Rourke. (Grove, $13.) The conservative political humorist, in a grab bag of musings on fin de si&#232","excerpt":"cle decadence, reveals himself to be a blunt Midwestern populist as he takes on the New Economy, alternative rock, Earth Day, the United Nations and the culture of celebrity. ''O'Rourke complains of midlife woes, but nothing has softened his wicked sense of fun,'' Allen D. Boyer said here last year.    THINKS . . . , by David Lodge. (Penguin, $14.) In his most ambitious novel, the author plays an ornate game of he said/she said, in which a swaggering, jet-setting academic star pursues a creative writing professor trying to control her grief over her husband's death. The result is a ''dense hodgepodge of farce and darker fare,'' Lisa Zeidner said here in 2001. ''But even when he's off target, it's always interesting and instructive to watch how he aims.''    POLITICAL FICTIONS, by Joan Didion. (Vintage International, $14.) In eight essays deconstructing the last four presidential elections and many of the foibles, scandals and crusades of the times, from campaign financing to the Clinton impeachment, Didion argues that American democracy has been abducted by a ''permanent political class.'' Last year in these pages, John Leonard admired her ''black conceit, her sonar ear, her radar eye and her ice pick/laser beam/night-scope sniper prose.''    AN HONORABLE PROFESSION, by John L'Heureux. (Grove, $14.) Part thriller, part novel of sexual possession and philosophical questioning, part satire of small-town mores, this tale centers on a popular high school teacher faced with a crucible of pain and guilt when he is accused of molesting a male student. The result is ''a rich, interesting work'' by an author ''who isn't afraid of dealing with dark themes,'' Robert Ward wrote in these pages in 1991.    THE RED OF HIS SHADOW, by Mayra Montero. (Ecco/HarperCollins, $12.95.) A Cuban writer living in Puerto Rico tells of the highly complex world of voodoo worship and of the isolated lives of Haitian sugar cane harvesters in the mountains of Hispaniola. Novels like this ''can invite us to walk through doors we didn't even know existed,'' Jana Giles said here in 2001. ''We come away humbled, confused, alienated, delighted, terrified.''

No good reason, most analysts would argue. But the current, high-stakes battle over reformulating gasoline shows it's not only a question of how clean you make it, it's how you make it clean.   While gasoline is a major source of hydrocarbons in urban air, the fuel's contribution to smog is plummeting because new cars are far cleaner than their predecessors. Thus James W. Kinnear, chief executive of Texaco, argues that Federal orders to squeeze the last few percent of hydrocarbons out of auto tailpipes in nine heavily polluted cities will make only a marginal difference to human health -- and will certainly not prove cost-effective.

Should I use a solution of bleach and water, one to four, with the brush, and would a clear wood preservative inhibit growth? A.Definitely use a bleach solution in scrubbing, to help remove the growth and help prevent regrowth. I suggest a stiff bristle brush, not wire. Protect eyes with goggles. Scrub the solution on, let it dry on the surface and rinse off with lots of plain water. When the wood is completely dry, applying a good preservative that contains a water repellent will help discourage moss and mildew. Q.Our books got wet from a leaky roof, and they smell of mildew.

Fraud was widespread, they said, with Bosnian Serb officials trying to maintain control of the town, once predominantly Muslim, by issuing fraudulent identity papers to Serbian refugees, some of them bused in from Serbia. Elections were set for September.   A12    New Candidate for Tory Leader  William Hague, the youngest Cabinet member of Britain's former Prime Minister, John Major, has emerged as the unexpected favorite in a race to be the new leader of the Conservative Party. Mr. Hague was the choice of the right wing of the party, which objects to former Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke's European sympathies.   A11    France to Relax on Immigration  France's new Socialist Government promised to revoke two anti-immigration laws enacted by the former center-right Administration over the past four years. The laws sharply curtailed new immigration and promoted deportation of undocumented foreigners.   A13    Deadly Foe of I.R.A. Is Slain  A prominent former member of a Protestant death squad in Northern Ireland was shot dead by an unknown assailant. The Royal Ulster Constabulary said that Irish republican guerrillas did not appear to have been involved in the killing of Robert Bates, who served 19 years in jail for killing Catholic nationalists.   A10    No Cease-Fire in Brazzaville  Mortar, grenades and machine-gun fire rained down on the capital of the Congo Republic, paying no evident heed to the orders for a cease-fire given by the two men battling for control of Brazzaville. Witnesses have reported wanton killing and looting by both government soldiers and militia troops.   A8    Kenya Elections Questioned  Kenya's general elections will not be fair unless constitutional reforms are carried out and repressive public-order laws are repealed, according to Amnesty International. The human rights organization criticized the Government of President Daniel arap Moi for breaking up opposition rallies and called on Western countries to flood Kenya with human-rights workers to monitor the election.   A6    American U.N. Plan Criticized  Diplomats and United Nations officials were less than enthusiastic about the strings attached to a deal worked out between the Clinton Administration and the Senate that would allow repayment of a large part of the American debt to the organization. Several envoys said that not all the demands made by Senators would be accepted by all 184 member countries.   A9    NATIONAL   A18-24, B12-16    McVeigh's Parents Plead For Jury to Spare His Life  The mother and father of Timothy J. McVeigh were the last two witnesses presented by lawyers for the defense in their effort to persuade the jury not to impose the death penalty on the 29-year-old former soldier. Today, prosecutors and Mr. McVeigh's lawyers will make their closing arguments to the jurors, who last week found Mr. McVeigh guilty of murder and conspiracy in the bombing of the Federal Building in Oklahoma City on April 19, 1995.   A1     Welfare Ruling Challenged  Republicans in Congress moved to prevent tens of thousands of welfare recipients from being covered by the minimum wage. They want to overturn a recent ruling by President Clinton that guarantees the minimum wage for welfare recipients participating in ''workfare'' programs run by public agencies or nonprofit organizations.   B16     Social Skills Gene Found  Scientists have found preliminary evidence of a gene or genes located on the X chromosome that might account for some of the greater social skills seen in girls compared with boys, and, by extension, for boys' higher rate of behavioral and learning disorders.   A18     Risk Seen in AIDS Drugs  The Government warned doctors that thousands of patients taking the powerful new AIDS drugs called protease inhibitors should be closely watched for an unexpected and apparently rare side effect: diabetes. The Food and Drug Administration stressed that the estimated 150,000 Americans taking protease inhibitors should not stop the treatment because the diabetes risk appears fairly small.   A22    Former Governor Cleared  Guy Hunt, the former governor whose criminal conviction in office three years ago stood out even in the rough-and-tumble world of Alabama politics, was fully exonerated by the state pardon board he largely appointed.   A18    Cohen Still Seeks Nominee  Defense Secretary William S. Cohen said he would not insist that the officer selected as the next Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff have a ''blemish-free'' sexual history, even though an admission of adultery doomed the candidacy of the Air Force general originally in line for the job. Cohen said he had no regrets over his handling of the furor that resulted from Gen. Joseph W. Ralston's acknowledgment that he had had an affair in the 1980's with an employee of the Central Intelligence Agency.   A24    Committee Seeks Immunity  Senator Fred Thompson of Tennessee, the Republican who heads the Senate committee investigating campaign finance abuses, has told associates that he wants to grant immunity from prosecution to at least 18 potential witnesses to obtain their testimony, but Democrats are expected to block the plan.   B13     NEW YORK/REGION   B1-11    Foster Children Trapped In Overworked System  Hundreds of New York City's most troubled children are stranded in city offices, psychiatric hospitals and private homes because the child welfare system is virtually filled to capacity. Foster care experts say the situation reflects the Giuliani Administration's decision to absorb state cuts by slashing payments to foster care agencies, contributing to the elimination of 400 group-home beds.   A1     Jet Vandalized at Kennedy  Wires underneath the cockpit of a Pan Am plane were cut as it sat on the ground at Kennedy International Airport hours before it was to leave for Miami. Federal law enforcement and aviation officials said they had not determined who had tampered with the wires, but they were looking into whether the damage might have been done by a worker angry that Pan Am was not using union mechanics.   B1    Man Indicted for Scalping  Complaints from a rock band that the best seats to its shows on Long Island had been siphoned off to scalpers and ticket brokers led to the indictment of the former box office manager of the Jones Beach Marine Amphitheater. State Attorney General Dennis C. Vacco said Joseph Nekola withheld about 400 tickets in the first 10 rows for two performances last summer by the band Hootie and the Blowfish and then resold them to brokers.
