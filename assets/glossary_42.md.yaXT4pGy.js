Other rules get changed if the Administration feels like it, they say.   As an example, they cite an 85-year-old rule that lets anyone object to the sale of a stand of National Forest trees. The rule gives the public 45 days to object, and shuts off the chainsaws for another 115 days while the Forest Service responds. The Forest Service wants to make objectors go to court to stop any sales, but local conservation groups say that would break them financially.

All this, plus a spate of negative reports dealing with such matters as AIDS and environmental pollution, resulted in empty hotel rooms and wails of complaint from shop owners and tour operators.\\n\\nIt was thus with considerable relief last month that Bangkok welcomed some 10,000 well-heeled bankers, government officials and financial reporters from 155 countries who converged on the city for a weeklong World Bank-International Monetary Fund Conference.

The occasion was a four-day national holiday marking the start of the rainy season in Thailand last April. Richard Frankel, an environmental engineer in Bangkok, recalled the scene: \\"On Wednesday night we figured we would try to beat the traffic and get out of town. We planned to drive to Chiang Mai, 200 miles north, and spend the holiday there. So we packed up the car, fed everyone and took off  from the house. Our plan was to drive on the expressway around Bangkok, continue out past the airport and then head north. We left the house at 10 P.M. The kids  were asleep in the back seat, everything was perfect -- until we hit the expressway. The traffic was backed up bumper to bumper for 60 miles. By 10 the next morning, we had only reached the airport, just a few miles from our house.  Some people abandoned their cars. We finally managed to turn around and spent the holiday at home.\\"         Bangkok today represents the dark side of the Asian economic miracle. It is the story of what happens when a country imports free-market capitalism, but without the governing structures that go with it to regulate growth. More people per capita drive Mercedes Benzes in Bangkok than anywhere in the world, and more people per capita cannot enjoy their Mercedes Benzes in Bangkok because they are always stuck in traffic. Many Bangkok drivers won't leave home without a mobile  phone and a portable potty in their car. Bangkok is a city of 10 million people  with so little central planning that it not only has no subway system, it doesn't even have a carpool lane. Everybody seems to have a car or motorbike and everybody drives. Only last year did Bangkok get its first small waste-water treatment facility, but most of the town still throws its garbage, and flushes its toilets, untreated, into the city's canals. Most people have stopped entertaining on weeknights because of the uncertainty when guests might arrive.  \\"All the spontaneity of life is gone,\\" says an environmental journalist, James Fahn. \\"You can't just call up your buddy and say 'Let's meet at a restaurant in  15 minutes.' \\" Rich city, poor life.
