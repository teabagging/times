Miss Stroyeva may not be entirely responsible for \\"Variety Stars,\\" which Artkino unveiled Saturday at the Stanley, but the contrast in talent and format of the two imports is baldly obvious.The new picture begins, as did the other, with a trainload of bubbling tourists bound for Moscow, where, it seems, amateur entertainers are converging for a contest. After one stop-over for a quite fetching musical jamboree after a country wedding, the spectator can rightfully anticipate another of those alluring, informal musical variety programs, by now a Soviet screen specially. You'd never know it, though, from what follows.Most of the acts are strictly fragmentary, performed on stage or in rehearsal halls. And for a mighty big country, the round-up of talent is surprisingly skimpy. The best of the lot are an exotic Turkmenian dance ensemble, an incredibly nimble workout by a small acrobatic ballet group, and, toward the end, several songs by a sweet-voiced lady named M. Mironova. In all fairness to Miss Stroyeva, one or two exterior performances suggest that the director, had she been given her way, would have let the numbers cue in a picturesque tour of the city, or vice versa.However, she and her artists don't stand a chance, pitted, for a good half of the time, against a pair of excruciatingly unfunny comedians named E. Berezin and L. Mirov. The boys may be considered hot stuff along the Volga, but heaven help them if they ever turn up here at the Palace.

But that's the point and the trouble: it isn't.At least thirty or forty other times, the big three-snouted battery of color cameras is mounted on automobiles or trains or airplanes or something—and propelled forward at rapid speed, while buildings and crowds and streets and scenery come racing toward you and whooshing closely past your ears, by virtue of the stereophonic-sound outlets on the sides and at the back of the theatre.There is one particular ride that is a caution. It is in an open automobile, via a long, winding road through some mountains and coming down at last to the Black Sea. You'd think the fellow driving the car was Barney Old-field, so wildly does he careen. This would be quite a thriller, if plenty of the same had not gone before.Otherwise, this Soviet \\"cinerama,\\" which is being presented here by the Soviet Ministry of Culture in conjunction with the Soviet exhibition at the Coliseum, is a generally handsome and impressive wide-screen-and-color travelogue, notably short on people and propaganda and long on spectacular views.There are some beautiful, bold scenes of Moscow, where the excursion begins, and some equally grand and objective scenes of Leningrad. There follow a stunning tour of the great steel mills at Magnitogorsk and some truly impressive views of an offshore oil \\"field\\" in the Caspian Sea at Baku.After a fifteen-minute intermission, during which the loyal members of the International Alliance of Theatrical and Stage Employes change reels in a specially constructed projection booth, the show takes us on some airplane hopping around the peaks of the Caucasus, gives us a ride on a log raft in the Carpathians and dunks us in the water at a Black Sea resort. It ends with a lot of bulging footage of the Sixth World Youth and Student Festival, held in Moscow in 1957, which is mainly flags, feet, fireworks and gay festoons.Technically, Kinopanorama is on a par with Cinemiracle. It has a lot of trouble with the match lines between the central panel and the two on the sides, and the central panel often is darker (or sometimes lighter) than the other two. But Sovcolor, the stock used, is excellent, and the nine-track stereo sound is first-rate. A good musical score, strong and jazzy, runs pretty much through the show.A device whereby the commentary is delivered by narrators, a man and a woman, speaking in English from outlets on opposite sides of the theatre, is a bit stilted and clumsy. And some of the things they say, especially the woman, are downright silly and often laughable. But what you see isn't laughable. It is as serious as can be.

The news, not wholly unexpected in the commodity markets, unfolded as farmers were burdened by large unsold surpluses from past harvests.

But such is \\"Mashenka,\\" which came to the Stanley yesterday. So mild and ingenuous is its manner, so completely unpretentious is its plot, that one accustomed to fireworks might charge it hasn't the substancs of a full-length film. For it simply tells the story of a Russian boy and girl who meet, fall in love and part ruefully in consequence of a lovers' tiff, then are happily rejoined for a moment on the Finnish battlefront, where he is a rugged tank driver and she an army nurse.That is literally all there is to it with the exception of a few vivid battle scenes.

But it must be noted, with the proof in the pudding, that neither undertaking quite fulfills the tingling promise of the label.For while both Artkino releases were filmed in Magicolor and indicate a great deal of time and trouble by the participants on each side of the camera, they emerge in surprisingly pedestrian format as picturesques curios for the specialists, with only mild interest for the balcony layman. And considering the Soviet knack for transcribing nature at its lustiest, it is equally unexpected to find some awesome giants of the deep playing second fiddle to a happy international assortment of twinkling toes.\\"The Whale Hunt,\\" produced by the Central Studios of the U. S. S. R. and running for almost an hour, traces, in routine travelogue superficiality, an expedition from Odessa to the Antarctic gaming waters, where the mammoth catches are processed aboard ship. But the eye-popping highlights—a storm-lashed vessel, the bloody resistance of the harpooned victims, and particularly the ingenious dismemberment on deck—hardly compensate for the overlong, generally unimaginative depiction of a trip whose excitement is more often suggested than conveyed.\\"World Festival of Song and Dance,\\" photographed at the World Youth Festival in Berlin last year by Mosfilm Studios and D. E. F. A. Films of Berlin, suffers only from repetition of a good thing and the fact that the camera has to focus unwaveringly, for the most part, on a stage the size of a dime.At any rate, compressed into view, before a large appreciative audience of delegates, is a staggering succession of folk dancers and singers demonstrating almost every conceivable type of national folk specialty. Garbed appropriately, the performers whirl, glide, stomp, writhe, trot and hop through a seventy-eight-minute program that may weary some spectators but never, assuredly, the exotic dynamos on the screen.If the Russian contributions are dominant, those from Czechoslovakia, Spain, Mongolia, the Argentine, Hungary, Roumania, Mexico, India, Finland, China and Brazil are no less estimable.Two of the most beguiling numbers are a Korean drum dance, in a sea of flashing kimonos and semiphore ribbons, and a Finnish fisherman's ensemble. The most incongruous are a primeval harvest chant from Nigeria and a Canadian version of an American square dance, with a hillbilly band intoning \\"Red River Valley.\\"In view of this rather confined documentary's sponsorship, the Russians, too, obviously, are not averse to gathering 'round and swinging their partners.

It should have been, considering all the zing, the picturesqueness and, especially lately, the human cameos the alert Russians have been applying to their war dramas.This Mosfilm Production, in particular, should at least have streaked like the wind in describing how a few carriage-borne Bolshevik civilians and soldiers race to a friendly town through the enemy-held countryside. But, generally, it jogs.Except for a couple of wild and woolly chase sequences right out of an American Western, the miles of fire are off-set by miles of talk. This Artkino import is conventional to the point of being old-fashioned. Most of the acting, the direction of S. Samsonov and even the musical score are all pretty broad and slapdash.For some weird reason, the picture has no English titles. Instead, there is a suave English narrator explaining the whole thing in a monotonous drone, butting in on one line, barely catching up with the next. Consequently, a good deal of Russian, for spectators who understand it, is blotted out. Joe Doakes, the man on the street, probably will sit there, closing one ear to the English drone, begrudgingly listening with the other and trying to keep the action in meaningful focus.Incidentally, the young hero and heroine, Igor Savkin and Marina Volodina, are quite convincing. So is A. Khodursky, as an old doctor. The color isn't bad at all, and some of the photography is quite sweeping. But it's hard to feel much sympathy for this group of supposedly brave, desperate Bolsheviks. Especially with such lines as \\"Death comes to everybody\\" and \\"Pahss the salt\\" filtering out in exactly the same English monotone.Artkino has supplemented the program with a forty-five-minute color subject called \\"Songs and Dances of Russia.\\" Approximately half of the numbers already have been shown here. One sequence shows the beguilingly smooth performing of the Beryozka girl ensemble now at the Broadway Theatre.The finale, as some young Russian \\"soldiers\\" take over, is extraordinary, briefly dimming everything else on the Cameo's new bill, including \\"Miles of Fire.\\" Screen: 'Miles of Fire'","excerpt":"Soviet Import Offered in Debut at Cameo"},{"year":"1977","title":"US and USSR officials complete 2 days of trade talks, Washington","excerpt":"Soviet imports of nonagr Amer products reptdly will decline sharply from $800-million annual level; total trade between nations in '76 put at $2.5-billion, $2.3-billion of which were Amer exports (M) U.S. and Soviet Will Start Talks On Pact to Ban All Nuclear Blasts"},{"year":"1946","title":"Allied Control Council orders bur 'L' closed because of its dealing in mil matters in violation of order dissolving Austrian Army Russians Yield in Austria On Occupation Cost and Oil","excerpt":"SOVIET IN AUSTRIA YIELDS ON 2 POINTS"},{"year":"1958","title":"USSR scientists unable to tell how rays affected dog Laika in Sputnik II satellite RAY'S EFFECTS UNKNOWN","excerpt":"Soviet in Dark on How Laika Withstood Radiation"},{"year":"1946","title":"USSR and GB disagree during Council session on aid to be extended to former enemy countries RUSSIA AND BRITAIN DIVIDE ON U.

It is not an academic question.   Soviet journalists appear with increasing frequency on American television, full of analysis, interpretation and varying degrees of charm. If you have not seen Vladimir Posner, for instance, on a news program or talk show, you probably do not watch much television. As a rule of thumb, appearances by Soviet commentators on American programs are in inverse proportion to the thickness of their accents, and Mr. Posner, born in New York, has no accent at all. He is a popular guest on ABC's ''Nightline'' and elsewhere. Meanwhile, we are certain to have not only Soviet journalists on American television in the future but Soviet programs as well: The Cable News Network will soon exchange programs with Intervision, a consortium of Eastern bloc broadcasting systems, while the Public Broadcasting System is now negotiating a similar agreement with the Soviet State Committee for Television and Radio. This is a new adventure for the global village.  Nonetheless, there is an enormous difference between Soviet and American television. One is in the service of the state and the other is not, particularly when journalism is involved.
