The principals in this ludicrous turns of events are the ever-amusing Joe E. Brown, whose willingness to take punishment helped in affording no little merriment","excerpt":"Winnie Lightner, who did so well in the picture \\"Gold Diggers of Broadway\\"; Sally O'Neil; Bert Roach, who does not get quite the opportunity he deserves; the fair Dorothy Revier, and Georges Carpentier, who, after seeing Maurice Chevalier, appears to have been fortunate in making the screen his second vocation, for as a performer he is at his best when he is in the prize ring and not when he is discussing sweet nothings with pretty girls.It is a gusty affair, this \\"Hold Everything,\\" with a funny pugilistic encounter in which Mr. Brown is one of the fighters. The Technicolor effects in these scenes are especially good, most of them being in focus.Mr. Brown figures as Gink Schiner, who does not object to being mistaken for a champion pugilist. He is, however, wary enough to avoid imbibing the drugged drink!Mr. Brown as Gink Schiner has his periods of pain, which, of course, afford pleasure to those in the plush seats. At one juncture he finds himself in a reducing cabinet and apparently is in great distress when the lever of the cabinet is jammed. Schiner seems at first to be trying to expire cheerfully, but subsequently the heat of the cabinet is too much for him and he becomes exhausted and is unable to keep his head above the aperture.Gink's mouth is likened to a cavern and one is constrained to believe that this is an apt description. This capacious mouth gives him an opportunity to express his mirth, his fear and his confidence in the ring. M. Carpentier may be the real fighter of this production, but Mr. Brown keeps the fun going to such extent that one would perhaps sooner see him trying to make the best of a bad bargain in a pugilistic encounter than gaze upon M. Carpentier's more serious fistic prowess.The Frenchman has to take on the champion, Bob Morgan, who is credited with dismissing his opponents in one or two rounds, according to his wont. Georges Carpentier, to afford suspense, has to permit Morgan to have the best of the fight for a few minutes, but finally Carpentier turns the tables on his adversary and rains blows upon him until the erstwhile champion is groggy.Dorothy Revier acts the placid and graceful Norine Lloyd, who is in love with Georges La Verne (M. Carpentier). She wants to give Georges a present, and as he happens to be the Beau Brummel of prizefighters, she can't think of anything more appropriate than a beautiful bathrobe. Norine does not know that Georges is much interested in the brunette, Sue Burke, whom he has known since he was a little boy. Miss Burke is played by Sally O'Neill.So long as Mr. Brown occupies the screen this picture is funny, but when it delves into romance the interest wanes. There are some pleasing songs and Miss Lightner does her share in her own way to enliven the episodes in which she appears.

This was one of the biggest audiences that the Metropolitan season, which has had big audiences, had as yet seen. And enormous applause and unexpected highlights and lowlights distinguished the occasion.The highest light, the most piercing beams of public favor, fell upon Giuseppe Valdengo, then I making his Metropolitan debut as Tonio, when he sang the Prologue. The beauty and resonance of the voice itself, in this place, coupled with the exceedingly dramatic delivery, brought shouts and salvos of approval, and definitely placed Mr. Valdengo, in this single moment, as an artist whose popularity with Metropolitan audiences is already established. His previous appearances at the City Center and with Mr. Toscanini at Radio City had indicated this. His Prologue more than fulfilled expectations.The whole impersonation is effectively developed, the make-up admirable. We could welcome a sharper edge and a more malignant dramatic profile in the scenes that follow. But this is finicky. If we had an opera company sprinkled with singers of the natural endowments and the high intelligence of this one, operatic production would not have to be as complicated a problem as most impressarios find it. Mr. Valdengo is an acquisition of high value to the Metropolitan.By his side was the admirable Nedda of Licia Albanesi. She sang to the birds not only with brightness but voluptuousness in the tone, as also in the scene with Silvio. The play within a play of the second act found her an admirable foil to the furious outbursts of Canio, in the harlequinade that so impressed the villagers by the earnestness of the actors, and the knifing that ended the comedy.Raoul Jobin made much of Canto's role, Leslie Chabay of the minor part of Beppe. Hugh Thompson sang with authority and maturity, but he seemed ill at ease in the stage business of Silvio. Giuseppe Antonicelli conducted ably.In the performance of \\"Cavalleria Rusticana,\\" Frederick Jagel distinguished himself by his singing and acting as Turiddu, an effect achieved at a few hours notice, since it was only in the morning that Mr. Jagel had been I notified that on account of the illness of Mario Berini a substitute was immediately required. The Metropolitan did not suffer by this substitution. The faithful, serious work and the experience of years had equipped Mr. Jagel to do what he did last night in \\"Cavalleria Rusticana.\\"As Santuzza, making her first appearance here in the role, Cloe Elmo was impressive on the dramatic side and again, despite a part which cannot lie well for such a genuinely deep voice, exceptionally capable of communicating emotion. Claramae Turner, admirably suited for the part, was the Lucia, Francesco Valentino the Alfio, Martha Lipton the Lola. The opera cannot be done ineffectively, the music is so passionate, fresh, explosive in the inimitably Sicilian style—music of genius, as Leoncavallo's music, at its poorest, is music irresistibly of the theatre. The return of the operatic twins to the Metropolitan repertory was very welcome—a welcome that does not wear with the seasons.
