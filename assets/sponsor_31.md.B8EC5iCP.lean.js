Still, this is the first studio picture to exhibit the tacky Troma influence, which means something, like the end of shame in Western civilization, perhaps. The first undead we see in this &quot;reimagining&quot; of the George Romero classic is a little girl with part of her face rotted away, who goes right for her dad's neck. The mother, Ana (Sarah Polley), barely escapes the house intact, and drives away. She runs into Kenneth (Ving Rhames), a uniformed cop. They make their way to the Crossroad Mall, where a handful of security guards have taken up residence. They're determined to keep the zombies out, especially once Ana figures out that the life-free scourge is spread from a zombie bite. A scene in which weapons have to be liberated from a gun store, so the group can get to a marina and sail away to safety — don't ask —  shows why zombie pictures aren't unsettling anymore.

Many are local, but some guerrilla movements operate across national boundaries.     Russia is the largest and most powerful example. For years it has been trying to organize collective action against Afghanistan under the Taliban, calling it a touchstone for rebels in the Caucasus and Central Asia, especially in the breakaway Chechen Republic. As the United States seeks Russian help, it will also try to avoid condoning the serious abuses that Russian troops have meted out to citizens of Chechnya, where last week Islamic-led separatists were rebuffed after a major assault.

And why not? In exchange for promising to cash out bondholders in a pinch, the banks collected fees ranging from one-half of 1 percent to 2 percent of the issues. And unlike interest income, which is earned slowly over the life of a loan, fee income lifts profits immediately.    The test will come now that so many borrowers are defaulting. Citibank alone has about $25 billion of standby letters of credit on its books, more than three times its equity and more than its highly leveraged transactions and commercial real-estate loans combined.   Even so, many experts believe the banks' exposure is modest, given their ability to seize collateral or seek reimbursement from the bond issuers to offset losses.

Brandeis High School in Manhattan, Alfred Cruz punches his student identification card into the machine just inside the front entrance. He steps onto a metal scanner and if the red light blinks on, he has to empty his pockets. He shoves his book bag through the X-ray machine, then he raises his arms so a security officer can wave a portable metal detector over his body like a wand.   Alfred says he no longer minds the mechanized routine of going to school, but educators point to the metal detector as a vivid emblem of the failures of the large urban high school. Overcrowded and impersonal, with a threat of violence, schools like Brandeis contribute to a staggering truancy rate, particularly among black and Hispanic boys, academic experts and educators say.

The Canadian troupe, which made favorable impressions on two previous visits, appears to be steadily gaining stature. On Tuesday night it offered four New York premieres at the Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, in Chelsea. The result was an unusually satisfying evening of modern dance.    One work was by David Earle, who founded Toronto Dance Theater in 1968 in association with Peter Randazzo and Patricia Beatty and who remains its artistic director. The other three were by the group's associate artistic director, Christopher House, one of Canada's most gifted young choreographers. All four pieces received committed performances by a company that can invest finely honed technique with emotional fervor.

The journey to its present smaller size but stylistically expanded repertory has been marked by major loss and carries a question mark as to what form the company will take in its second decade. Mrs. Staugaard-Jones, an associate professor of dance at the college, as well as the company's director and principal choreographer, epitomizes the burden borne by a small troupe's leader, who must bring the energy and skills for both the company's business and creative sides. \\n\\nWhere others in the state have foundered, she has endured, teaching dance to college students by day and rehearsing both the student ensemble and her own dancers in the evenings.  Now 42 and increasingly involved with family responsibilities, she is beginning to question whether she wants to continue battling the \\"red tape\\" that accompanies the business side of the organization and interferes with the creative impulse that drives a choreographer.
