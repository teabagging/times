The issue in textiles, complicated by differences between the United States and Western Europe, is whether there will be a new ''multifiber arrangement,'' which is supposed to provide developing countries with assurances of orderly growth in the textile markets of the rich countries.   The arrangement is actually an umbrella agreement among 42 countries that permits bilateral quotas, under certain general principles, to be worked out between individual textile suppliers and the industrialized importing countries.   Mr. Brock drew White House hostility last spring after he decided to go to Tokyo to assist the Japanese in ''voluntarily'' restricting car shipments to this country. Privately, White House aides said that Mr. Brock should not have made the trip because it gave the impression that the Reagan Administration, publicly committed to trade liberalization, was actively putting pressure on the Japanese.

Or, as the late pianist and psychologist Jimmy Durante put it: ''Did you ever have the feeling that you wanted to go, and still have the feeling that you wanted to stay?'' That sort of conflict between knowing and feeling is regularly felt by serious listeners who go to hear music with firmly based preconceptions. In many ways, these people are among the brightest, if not invariably the best, of music listeners. Some of them are music critics, for whom the firm preconception is invaluable - one of the tools of the trade.   These listeners know, say, what scholars have discovered about how many musicians Handel employed in each performance of the ''Messiah.'' They know that most musicologists at the moment do not favor the kind of Victorian excess that set hundreds or even thousands of singers and instrumentalists to bellowing and scraping away at that indestructible oratorio. And yet, when a huge choir lets loose with ''Wonderful, Counselor, the Everlasting Prince of Peace,'' knowledg e can suddenly find itself pushed int o the back seat, momentarily overwhelmed by raw, thoughtless f eeling, by body logic.

Thailand continues to draw investors, even after the coup, because of its large potential for economic growth. In addition, it offers good values in light of the sharp fall in the stock exchange after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait last August. The quick rise in oil prices to more than $40 a barrel sent the Thai market tumbling 52.4 percent, a reflection of the country's deep dependence on imported oil.

Unlike most diplomatic buildings, in which space is entirely carved into private offices, much of the new Thai mission is divided by low partitions. Its top floor has been renovated as a penthouse office suite, which includes a greenhouse, for senior diplomats.

Another company proposed a line of baby togs and accessories bearing the Material Kid's image. More bizarre was a $10,000 offer to film the delivery -- along with a soothing promise not to show  Madonna's face. Madonna said no, emphatically, and declined to discuss the ongoing assault.

Setting aside the debatable proposition that concepts like ''human rights'' and ''human dignity'' are rooted in ''Christian values'' rather than universal human values, many secular, rational Europeans unquestionably could ''coherently'' explain that they believe in such things because they believe in the rule of law. And they might also point out that, whether or not their religious beliefs are truly dead, it is not they but the religiously ''vibrant'' Americans who are abusing human rights and human dignity around the globe by waging aggressive war, torturing detainees and murdering countless civilians, all in violation of the rule of law.    Perhaps there is more to those ostensibly ''dead religious beliefs'' than Fukuyama acknowledges -- and perhaps they are a lot less dangerous than an arrogant, crusading and fundamentally dishonest religiosity that wraps itself in the mantle of ''human rights'' and ''human dignity'' while betraying and destroying the substance of those principles.

Robert Schwarz  [ \\"Pop Goes the Music -- Classical, Too,\\" Jan. 20 ] , is either specious or puerile. Are these people ignorant, or are they ignoring facts so as to reinforce a weary premise -- \\"Composers must reflect their times\\"? Young artists (but Mr. Lang is already 34) often justify what they concoct by announcing that art must reflect the times. They don't yet realize that any work of art, good or bad, reflects the times merely by virtue of inhabiting the times","excerpt":"that all times are chaotic, and that art    is    the times, by definition, which is why art, no matter how political its intent, cannot change the times. Consider:   Mr. Schwarz quotes Mr. Lang: \\"I wouldn't trust any young composer who grew up in America who didn't have a background in pop music . . .  In America that's your first impulse.\\" If in America that's your first impulse, then Mr. Lang's trust need not be tried. Yet Mr. Schwarz declares: \\"That statement would undoubtedly be disputed by many older composers, especially those who have devoted themselves to the study of European masterpieces and all but ignored the music around them.\\"   What composers? The crucial aim of American composition since 1920 has been the eschewing of Europe. All composers of my own and the preceding generation have been as receptive to \\"the music around them\\" -- in our case, jazz, swing bands, blues -- as young ones today. Not just Gershwin, Thomson, Antheil, Copland, Blitzstein, Bernstein and Gunther Schuller (who coined the term Third Stream) but even such a thorny type as Milton Babbitt credits his current language to his adolescent skills as a saxophonist in jazz ensembles, while Elliott Carter has said that the 1930's bands on 52d Street permanently affected his work. (My own 400 songs have been more influenced by Billie Holiday's way with a tune than by standard classics, and that holds for most other \\"classic\\" songwriters.) Which doesn't mean that the pop world cared, or even knew about, what Babbitt and Carter wrote. But elsewhere Benny Goodman, Artie Shaw and Woody Herman did commission Bartok, Copland and Stravinsky, which is probably more than Mr. Lang's beloved punk rock group, the Clash, will ever do for him.   \\"To Americans in their 20's and 30's . . . the American vernacular, not Beethoven, is the mother tongue.\\" Isn't the use of American vernacular precisely what Aaron Copland was advocating, successfully, 70 years ago? Name me one, just one, American composer of repute since then for whom Beethoven is the mother tongue. American forsook Germany for France way back with Griffes, and forsook France for the vernacular by 1940. Oddly enough, Schwarz invoked young Michael Torke as a leader of today's exemplars of the vernacular; in fact, Torke's big new Mass is wholly a pastiche of Bach, Schubert and Faure, and his big new Piano Concerto combines Brahms with Dvorak, with nary a hint of Americana in either work.   If Mr. Lang \\"abhors what he regards as false reverence toward the European classical heritage,\\" well, what composers from the previous generation are in reverence of that heritage? If he \\"sees more and more composers making a conscious effort to assimilate and synthesize the increasingly multicultural musical scene,\\" that observation is, by its nature, not worth mentioning. And if he \\"has rarely played by the rules,\\" well, what good composer has? And what are the rules?   The rules for Mr. Lang are those he makes up as he goes along, according to his juvenile revelations; any musician \\"who didn't listen to  [ pop ]  music as his first music\\" is blind to the True Way. Shades of Pierre Boulez, who, from Paris in 1952, let loose a flood of damage throughout the universe with his famous facist dictum: \\"Any musician who has not felt the necessity of the dodecaphonic language is of no use.\\" (Omit the \\"not\\" and I'd agree.) But Mr. Lang can't cause much damage, since things have been going his way for a long while now. He just hasn't heard.   I sit on a reviewing committee that dispenses largesse to American artists of all ages. We listen carefully to works of some 80 American composers. It is fascinating to see how, despite shifting trends over the decades, from 12-tone to New Romantic to Minimal, basic impulse remains the same. This year most entries were sound-effect scores, directionless but colorful, with ornate titles like Mr. Lang's own \\"Eating Live Monkeys.\\" Pop is nowhere in obvious evidence, any more than jazz in its ultimate refinement jumps from Milton Babbitt's pages. Still, we are what we eat, and the vernacular is here too by osmosis.   My purpose is not to suggest that one day Mr. Lang may blush for his sillier statements. (Rock is \\"music that takes risks, that is outrageous, that shouts at people and tries to wake them up,\\" as though coercive noise were itself a virtue, and quietness the vice of finks. \\"The idea of taking the chord you need when you need it is a very strong one.\\" Well, I guess    so   .) My purpose is to show that his brainstorm did not begin with him. It may be that Mr. Lang's own music is vital, absorbing, important; it may also be that these traits stem from a use of the vernacular. But that is not for him to say, or even to know. It is not for any composer to review his own work, or even to proclaim an esthetic (he's usually wrong anyway). It is for him to get the work done, and let it defend itself.

The original drugs had many unpleasant side effects, from dizziness and painful dry mouth to weight gain and sluggishness. Doctors, too, were uneasy about the potency of the pills, and thus prescribed the medications for short courses, up to nine months maximum.   Many doctors say they are comfortable keeping their patients on the newer antidepressants for long stretches. They say the drugs are safer than the older generation of pills, are almost impossible to overdose on, have fewer side effects and work wonderfully for patients who were difficult to treat before, including those who suffer from panic disorders, anxiety attacks, bulimia, anorexia, or obsessive-compulsive disorder.    Yet the medical portrait of Prozac and related compounds emerging from years of use among millions of patients is not a simple sunburst of unfettered success. The drugs bear their own disturbing consequences and question marks, particularly in their long-term risks. Some doctors worry that, with all the pep talk surrounding the novel antidepressants, the trouble spots are being ignored and the pills being presented as the pharmacological equivalent of a Snackwell fat-free cookie: a chance at bliss without paying the price. 'Deceptively Easy'    \\"Drugs like Prozac are so deceptively easy to take and tolerate that they can excuse a physician from respecting the complexity of depression,\\" said Dr. Frederick K. Goodwin, director of the National Institute of Mental Health.    But that has not stopped some patients. Rebecca L. Morgan of Monaca, Pa., has been on Prozac for three years, since she was 27, and she has no intention of quitting, ever. The drug is the flagship member of a new fleet of antidepressants, and it has transformed her life. Before Prozac, she could not keep a job for more than a few months at a time. For the past year and a half, she has been a counselor for the mental health association in Beaver County. Before Prozac, she suffered five episodes of major depression, during which she could hardly drag herself off her couch or feel enough to realize she was miserable. Now, she still has emotional peaks and troughs, but when she is faced with an adverse event, she does not slide into a depression as she says she would have in the past.    \\"I don't know what the long-term effects of the drug are,\\" she said, \\"but if 20 years from now they say it affects the kidneys or the lungs or whatever, I'm willing to pay the price. Prozac helps me now.\\"   Ms. Morgan is not alone in embracing Prozac as a permanent therapy for the chronic problem that is her melancholic nature. Since Prozac was introduced five years ago, its popularity has soared to tropospheric heights. More than 10 million people have taken the drug worldwide, earning for its maker, Eli Lilly & Company, about $1 billion a year. Many other people are using even newer, chemically related drugs called by the trade names Paxil and Zoloft. And while most remain on the medications for less than a year, a sizable minority are staying on the drugs for two years or longer.  Drugs Are Specific    Much of the relative safety of the new class of drugs, called serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, lies in their biochemical specificity. The original antidepressants, introduced in the 1950's and known as the tricyclics and the monoamine oxidase inhibitors, jiggle multiple biochemical pathways in the brain and reconfigure the balance of several different types of signaling molecules, or neurotransmitters. By comparison, Prozac and its cousins zero in on one neurotransmitter, serotonin, brightening mood and lessening anxiety by keeping pools of the chemical available in the brain for nerve cells to use and reuse. Greater specificity in the nervous system means fewer side effects throughout the body.    Nevertheless, some researchers warned that serotonin is a muscular chemical and that manipulating it even with exquisite specificity is bound to reverberate in unexpected ways. Although early fears that Prozac may occasionally initiate violent or suicidal behavior have not been supported by extensive clinical studies, new studies show that serotonin re-uptake inhibitors have a more severe impact on sexuality than at first estimated, causing symptoms like impotence, an inability to ejaculate, an inability to reach orgasm, a loss of sensation in the vagina, and an all-round loss of interest in one's erotic affairs.    \\"The early studies on this suggested an incidence of about 2 percent, but that was based on self-reporting, from the patients,\\" said Dr. Peter Kramer, author of the best seller \\"Listening to Prozac.\\" \\"When researchers went out and vigorously interviewed people, they found 40 percent had some sexual dysfunction.\\"    Another common side effect of the new antidepressants that had been underemphasized until recently, said Dr. Brian Doyle, director of the Georgetown Anxiety Disorders program, is sleep disturbances. Perhaps a third of Prozac users suffer severe insomnia, and some who manage to fall sleep report excessively vivid dreams that can verge on nightmares.   For those Prozac users in whom insomnia becomes unbearable, some doctors prescribe small doses of, oddly enough, the older tricyclic antidepressants, which can be sedating. But physicians never mix the serotonin re-uptake inhibitors with the monoamine oxidase inhibitors","excerpt":"that combination can be extremely dangerous, causing rigidity, rapid fluctuations in vital signs, extreme agitation progressing to delirium, coma and even death. Drugs Fail for Some    Researchers also warned that the serotonin compounds do not work for 20 percent to 40 percent of depressed or anxious people who try them, the same failure rate seen with the older antidepressants. Some patients say they find drugs like Prozac disorienting or too amphetamine-like in their properties, causing problems in concentration and memory.    Apart from known side effects, the risks of taking any antidepressant drug for years is not yet clear, for the simple reason so far no one has taken the drug for very long. In studies with mice and pigs, Canadian investigators have found that antidepressants can act as tumor promoters, hastening the growth of nascent malignancies. These preliminary results have yet to be confirmed by others, and there is no evidence to suggest that antidepressants contribute to cancer in humans, but some researchers admit that the long-term risks remain to be gauged.    Because women suffer a disproportionate rate of depression and thus are more likely to be takers of Prozac, a few studies have looked at the effect of the antidepressants on pregnant women. So far, researchers have seen no increase in birth defects from the drugs, but women who take any sort of antidepressant drug, including Prozac, have about twice the rate of miscarriages during the first trimester of pregnancy as do women not on the medications.    Nor can researchers be sure that exposing a fetus to a drug capable of altering the balance of neuronal signaling molecules does not have a subtle impact on the brain that only shows up years later, say, as a learning disorder. In addition, a nursing mother on Prozac may transmit traces of the medication to her infant, again with unknown effects. Long-Term Treatment    The trend toward treating recurrent depression as a chronic disease, deserving of long-term, if not lifetime treatment with antidepressants, is likely to accelerate, doctors said.   \\"Eighty to 90 percent of people who had one episode of depression will have another,\\" said Dr. David Kupfer, a professor and chairman of psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. \\"That realization makes me much more aggressive. People need long-term treatment, and we need to figure out the best strategy.\\"   But some researchers observe with concern that the drift toward extended drug regimens is occurring in parallel with another trend: prescribing antidepressants for people who are not really depressed. Prozac is now being given with some regularity to patients diagnosed as \\"dysthymic,\\" jargon for perpetually crabby, under the weather, insecure, malcontent.   \\"Dysthymia has less of a biological feel to it\\" than does full-blown depression, said Dr. Doyle of the Georgetown Anxiety Disorders program. \\"There's not as much of the sleep disturbances or the appetite problems. These are people who realize they're more unhappy than the situation calls for, and that meditation, exercise, talking to friends just doesn't do the trick.\\"   As it turns out, Dr. Doyle said, many dysthymics do very well on Prozac and its chemical siblings, finding in the drugs a brightening of mood that therapy sessions alone may have failed to bring.    But whether the syndrome is a true disease is a matter of considerable debate among doctors. And to some critics, the idea of people who are not really sick taking potent psychiatric drugs for months or years is a sobering prospect indeed.

If that is the case, then all of us should be rushing to replace our washable clothing with single-use paper-and-plastic garments. We could save a tremendous amount of water at the mere cost of increased use of wood pulp, increased manufacture of plastic with its waste products and another few percent of the space in landfills.    Air pollution: Most cloth diaper users I know (including two-career families) don't use a service; they launder their own. Second, what about the trucks that deliver disposable diapers to stores? Extra trips in the family car to pick up only diapers? The air and water pollution caused by the manufacture of disposables?   Composting: Yes, a manufacturer says it can be done. But I'm not at all sure I want chemical-laden diaper linings next to my child's skin and reproductive organs, much less composted into the food chain.   Public health: I have never seen a used cloth diaper lying on a playground. I have seen many disposables, and I worry more about these as a potential source of contagion.    Disposable diapers use at least seven times more raw materials than cloth and take up virtually 100 percent more space in our dwindling landfills.   Another argument in favor of cloth diapers that I have yet to see anyone mention is comfort to an infant's tender skin. How many of us would agree to turn in our cotton underwear for paper?

This one, produced by Warner Brothers, appears to have sprung from a mind as whimsically creative as that which conceived the Toidy Doll.Let us describe it briefly: A young lady, whom Betsy Drake plays, figures out a novel deception for getting courtesy on a crowded subway train. She wraps a $2 doll baby in a blanket and carries it in her arms. The solicitude of her fellow passengers is amazing beyond any words.But, being a whimsical creature, the young lady also gives her doll a name. She names it Cyrus Baxter Douglas, after a lordly manufacturer of baby foods. And one day, while riding on the subway, she meets a grumpy but tolerable old man who becomes interested in the baby and casually asks its name. She tells him, with some elaborate flattery of the manufacturer, whom she has never met. (Anyone who, at this point, cannot figure who the old man is should go to nursery school.)So, of course, the old fellow, incognito, begins an elaborate campaign to endow his mysterious namesake, and his first move is to command a better job for the baffled young lady at the advertising agency—his own advertising agency—where she works. And, of course, this ad agency is headed by a couple of aggressive young men who also are attractive and susceptible. (The situation is loaded, you see.)Well, it goes on and on in that fashion, with the old man beseeching a peek at his vacant-eyed toy-store namesake, the young lady wondering what to do and the young men huffing and puffing to get an okay on a new ad campaign. And finally, after lots of confusion and slapstick of the most nonsensical sort, it is revealed that the baby is a phoney, but a spontaneous romance is not.The only reason we have outlined this plot in considerable detail is to demonstrate that it is really as infantile as we say. And beyond this, there's nothing more to tell you, except that Miss Drake is tiresomely distraught in a role against which the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Women should complain","excerpt":"that Edmund Gwenn, excellent actor that he is, is a bore as the old man, and that Zachary Scott and Dennis Morgan act like idiots as the advertising men.On the stage at the Strand are the Three Stooges, the Weavers, Florian Zabach, the Maxellos and the \\"Harvest Moon Ball\\" winners.

Somerset Maugham's play \\"The Constant Wife,\\" which two years ago gave Ethel Barrymore an opportunity to deliver epigrams in the grand manner, has returned to Broadway. It tripped in a bit disguised by the name, \\"Charming Sinners,\\" and with different characters. But it is still good entertainment.It was Mr. Maugham who paused in the writing of epigrams long enough to note dismally in \\"The Moon and Sixpence\\" that the art of conversation has languished","excerpt":"that epigrams are \\"mechanical appliances\\" by which the dull \\"may achieve a semblance of wit.\\" Having delivered himself of the plaint, Mr. Maugham wrote epigrams—and to show he could do it, kept them from being mechanical. And Paramount has had the good judgment to retain the Maugham manner in its latest picture.The differences between the picture, \\"Charming Sinners,\\" and the play which appeared on the stage, lie chiefly in the fact that the screen apparently is afraid to undertake even a defense of the single standard. In \\"The Constant Wife\\" the lady therein started for a vacation in Italy with a gentleman companion—after her husband had made a temporary departure from the Ten Commandments; in the picture the companion gets off the train just as it leaves the station.As for the rest, however, the actors—many of them stage players who departed the ship—take Mr. Maugham's interesting lines and do with them as they should. Given a Maugham epigram (and a reasonable break by the sound-recording instrument) they make it into something with character, a phrase which causes the audience to feel that every one concerned is having a good time.Ruth Chatterton takes the part exploited on the stage by Miss Barrymore, that of a physician's wife, and Clive Brook plays the errant husband. The fluffy-haired young thing without brains, but with wistful manner, is portrayed by Mary Nolan. All appear to understand what is wanted and go about it accordingly.The earlier part of the picture (to bring in a mote of pessimism) is not quite clear; it sounds a little as though the actors were stationed some distance from the microphone. But in the later—the greater part of the film—the reproducing device works well enough for everything to be heard. A few lines at the beginning are jagged and partly lost because of the microphone.As most of the theatre-going public remembers from the play, the story is of a married physician (in London) who falls in love with a young woman. He thinks his wife is unaware of the infatuation, but he is wrong. Finally, she helps him break off his affair, and then starts out calmly on a little vacation of her own. Toward the end, he tells her to come back \\"in six weeks,\\" and she airily agrees.The Paramount's stage offering is built more or less around the figure of Paul Ash, late of Chicago. Besides the \\"Stage Band,\\" those credited with assists are Ross and Edwards, Paul and Ferrel, Laura Lane, Alan Lowe, Lawrence Adler and the Dave Gould Girls. The feaures are varied.

Sports of The Times","excerpt":"That Gun Is Loaded!"},{"year":"1991","title":"ALCIBIADES, THE ANCIENT Greek orator whose name is pronounced Al Si-BY-a-deez, is quoted less often these days than Al Capone. Granted, the gangster got off a great line, cited by eminent strategic planners as well as young punks: \\"You can get much farther with a kind word and a gun than you can with a kind word alone.\\" Alcibiades, however, is best remembered for what he did not say.   Robert Byrd of West Virginia, guardian of the United States Senate's sense of history, rose in that body recently to call our attention to the lesson of the Greek who was the ward of Pericles.   \\"Alcibiades is not exactly a paragon of good living,\\" the Senator cautioned. That's putting it mildly: Alcibiades was the paragon of recklessness and treachery, who sold out his native Athens for a place in Sparta, and is remembered for opinions like \\"As for democracy . . . nothing new can be said about an acknowledged foolishness.\\"   But the man could speak, and he had a trick that caused audiences to hang on his words: \\"Plutarch tells us,\\" Senator Byrd said, \\"on the authority of the prince of orators, Demosthenes, that Alcibiades often hesitated in the midst of a speech, not hitting upon the word he wanted, and stopped until it occurred to him.\\" Why, the Senator asked rhetorically, don't we do that anymore? \\"I think there can be an art in the use of a pause. And I find nothing wrong with a pause. It does not have to be filled in with    you know   .\\" This pestiferous phrase \\"betrays a mind whose thoughts are often so disorganized as to be unutterable -- a mind in neutral gear coupled to a tongue stuck in overdrive.\\"   Although grease monkeys in garages across the land would rise to raise a point of metaphoric order that    overdrive    arranges gears to produce greater speed with less power (the drive shaft to the wheels may turn four times for every three revolutions of the engine's crankshaft), the term has been used as a verb in the King James translation of Genesis 33:13 and is used figuratively today as a noun rooted in automotive mechanics to mean \\"heightened activity potentially leading to the stress of overwork.\\"   Although the Senator's mechanical metaphor is sustainable, is his complaint sound -- that is, is the ubiquitous    y'know    a nervous filler used by speakers too embarrassed to pause when the appropriate word does not come to mind?   Only sometimes. We are now into what Demosthenes, Alcibiades & Company would call    embolalia    -- em-bo-loll-ya -- from the Greek for \\"the insertion of chatter.\\" Modern linguists led by Leonard Bloomfield in 1933 call these \\"hesitation forms\\" -- the sounds of stammering (   uh   ), stuttering (   um, um   ), throat-clearing (   ahem!   ), stalling (   well, um, that is   ), interjected when the speaker is groping for words or at a loss for the next thought.   You know that    y'know    is among the most common of these hesitation forms. Its meaning is not the imperious \\"you understand\\" or even the old interrogatory \\"do you get it?\\" It is given as, and taken to be, merely a filler phrase, intended to fill a beat in the flow of sound, not unlike    like   , in its new sense of, like, a filler word.   Similarly,    I mean   , as most frequently used today, has ceased to mean    I mean    -- in its former sense of \\"for me, this denotes, expresses, represents,\\" or \\"here is my import, sense, significance, message.\\" Ironically, often the new sense of    I mean    is no sense at all: it is intended to convey meaninglessness, a habitual, annoying filler phrase synonymous with the unknowing    y'know   .   But I want to suggest that the words and phrases dismissed as hesitation forms are sometimes used for purposes other than to moan or to stammer with socially acceptable grunts while groping.   All three of these staples of modern filler communication --    I mean, y'know, like    -- can also be used as \\"tee-up words.\\" In olden times, pointer phrases or tee-up words were    get this, would you believe?    and    are you ready?    The function of these rib-nudging phrases was -- are you ready? -- to make the point, to focus the listener's attention on what was to follow.   That attention-impelling function, or \\"articulated colon,\\" today belongs to    I mean, y'know    and    like   , as in \\"That girl is,    like   , kooky","excerpt":"that guy is,    I mean   , gnarly --    y'know   , far out to the point of spaciness.\\" (Do not confuse this articulated colon with another interjection, known tentatively in the linguistic dodge as \\"the nail-nibbling self-reassurance\\"; in the 70's,    O.K.?    was interjected to mean \\"Are you listening? Am I making sense?\\" Today,    y'know?    with a rising inflection often serves this nebbishistic function.)   And that's not all, as the man says. (   As the man says   ,    so to speak    and    as it were    are apologies for cliches; for some reason,    the man    has replaced    they   . These are self-conscious interjections related to hesitation forms but considered more adult.) Another purpose of hesitation forms is to dissociate yourself slightly from the harsh reality of what is to follow. (\\"Darling, I'm, like, involved with this other person.\\") It is the articulation of a slight grimace.   By the use of a beat of time filled with a meaningless interjection, uncommitted people who are \\"into distancing\\" make a little space between themselves and their words, as if that lessens their impact. Thus, when we hear one of the ubiquitous trio of hesitation forms, we should ask ourselves: is this being used as (1) a purposeful tee-up, (2) a cowardly disengager or (3) a mere filler to cover a grope?   If the purpose is to tee up or point, we should accept    y'know    and its friends as a mildly annoying spoken punctuation, the articulated colon that signals \\"focus on this.\\" If the purpose is disengagement, we should pity the non-committer. If the purpose is to grab a moment to think, we should allow ourselves to wonder: why are filler phrases needed at all? What motivates the speaker to fill the moment of silence with any sound at all?   Now we are back to the Alcibiadean pause. Did the sneaky Greek orator really pause because he was seeking the right word -- or did he use that refreshing device, as Churchill later did, to pull listeners to the edge of their seats?   I recall a session that a roomful of image makers held with a Presidential candidate before a televised news conference. The problem was that the candidate anticipated all the questions, knew all the answers and tended to pop out the reply the moment the question was asked; it made him seem like a smart aleck, too glib.   The sage advice was this: On at least one question, cross 'em all up with a pregnant pause. Stop. Pause a moment or two -- like maybe three whole seconds, driving sound-bite specialists crazy with the waste of costly network time -- as if the question caused the interviewee to think his position over. No need for    well, y'know, I mean    or any such filler, though a thoughtful    hmmm    might be permissible.   It worked. Attention was paid. The ghost of Alcibiades . . . smiled.

But at 208 pounds, Evander Holyfield never blinked.   \\"If you can get under a big guy's punches,\\" Holyfield had said, \\"then you can hurt him with your punch.\\"    And in the third round last night, Holyfield ascended to the world heavyweight championship with a one-punch knockout. Moving away from a right uppercut that never landed, Holyfield threw a right hand that toppled Douglas onto the canvas. After landing on his left side, Douglas flopped backward, trying to rub his right eye with his right glove, then twice with his left glove before he was counted out by the Referee Mills Lane while reposing on his back.    \\"I was trying to focus,\\" the dethroned champion said later when asked why he had rubbed his eyes. \\"I got a glove caught in it.\\"    He got Holyfield's glove caught in it, the glove on the right hand that had levelled him. But for three rounds Douglas had been unable to focus on what he had to do: retain the title he had won so shockingly and so impressively with a 10th-round knockout of Mike Tyson last February in Tokyo.    Over the three rounds, Douglas landed only one decent punch, a hard right hand early in the third round.    During the first and second rounds, Douglas threw the jab that had neutralized Tyson, but most of those jabs never quite reached Holyfield's face. They were pawing jabs with no snap, with none of his 246 pounds behind them. As a result, Holyfield, who had opened cautiously, soon had Douglas moving backward. And downward.   \\"I was hoping to get some rounds under my belt to get my rhythm going,\\" Douglas said later, \\"but he caught me with a good shot.\\"    Holyfield's trainer, George Benton, had predicted that his gladiator would outjab Douglas, and he did. But the Douglas up there in the ring at the Mirage last night in ideally warm weather was not the Douglas who had been on display in Tokyo when he got off the canvas in the 8th round and finished Tyson in the 10th round.   Some people, including the referee, thought that Douglas could have beaten the count.   \\"I tried to get up,\\" Douglas said. \\"If I could've gotten up, I would have.\\"    Asked about his weight, Douglas replied, \\"I was comfortable with my weight","excerpt":"that had no bearing on it.\\" And maybe it didn't. Maybe he would have been as bad at 236 or 226. In the days leading up to his $20 million payday, Douglas emphasized how much he wanted to retain the title to show that his triumph over Tyson had not been a fluke, that he was a real champion. But now he's got to live with the reality that his reign in the ring as champion lasted only 6 minutes 70 seconds into his first title defense.    Unless Douglas somehow redeems himself, his weight of 246 pounds at the weigh-in, and perhaps 250 when he entered the ring, will remain as much an indictment of his trainers, J. D. McCauley and John Russell, as of him.    Douglas didn't appear as blubbery as George Foreman has been in some of his recent bouts. But any trainer worth the towel over his shoulder knows enough to weigh his fighter every day in the weeks before a fight, sometimes two or three times a day. After the weigh-in scale showed Douglas at 246, McCauley professed not to be concerned and professed that it wasn't important to have weighed Douglas daily.    \\"Are they training him,\\" Holyfield's other trainer, Lou Duva, asked, \\"or is he training them?\\"    Whatever the case, Douglas has returned to the shadows from whence he came. His record is now 30-5-1. His reputation is even worse. Holyfield, meanwhile, is now what Mike Tyson was: the undefeated and undisputed heavyweight championn with 21 knockouts in his 25 fights, even though only 7 have been against heavyweights.     But just as Tyson kept Holyfield waiting for a title shot, Holyfield now will keep Tyson waiting while 42-year-old George Foreman moves to the front of the line.    Over the weekend the World Boxing Council, the World Boxing Association and the International Boxing Federation decreeed that if Holyfield won, he had to defend the title against Tyson within 120 days. But when that edict arrived at the Mirage by fax, it appeared on a Don King Productions letterhead.   \\"King is yelling and screaming that we'd have to fight Tyson,\\" said Shelly Finkel, who is Holyfield's adviser. \\"But as the champion, Evander has a year before he has to fight the mandatory challenger.\\"   Finkel spoke of a contract already negotiated for a Holyfield-Foreman title bout worth $20 million to Holyfield and $12 million for Foreman. As for Buster Douglas, he lost $20 million for a Tyson title rematch. And as a defending champion, Buster was a big bust.

Although it is concerned with a football player and football weather, it is not a brisk business.

Its success is scored whenever it overcomes this usually fatal handicap, and becomes vitally human. And it succeeds in many scenes. All of Mr. Tucker's power to put life on the screen, to make his people something more than marionnettes, is evident time after time in the course of the story. In moving pictures that mean something and have the quality of beauty, too, the characters of the photoplay are intermittently effective.Intermittently, but not continuously. For every now and then, through the overacting of certain players, the lack of significance in scenes, or the oppressive weight of the story's \\"theme\\"—yes, they always call it \\"theme\\" in the trade—the photoplay becomes flat, just a labored movie. But, mind you, if the picture is vital intermittently, it is also dull only off and on, and if you take it altogether, the good with the bad, \\"Ladies Must Live,\\" is many degrees better than most of the motion pictures you are likely to see in any season at the theatres.And it should be added that the picture is reported to have been somewhat severely dealt with by the New York censors. How much their cuts are responsible for its occasional breaks in continuity and other shortcomings is not known. At any rate, they did not leave in it any scenes, it would seem, that a normal adult could consider objectionable.Of the large cast, Betty Compson and Leatrice Joy do the most finished work. Lucille Hutton, Lule Warrenton and Marcia Manon are often effective, but sometimes overdo their parts. Snitz Edwards, as a wealthy little shrimp, is the most telling of the men in the east.The story covers too much ground to be outlined here, even in its important details, but its idea is that women are on the defensive in life and are only obeying a natural instinct to live when they become shrewd, calculating and even unscrupulous in overcoming the obstacles of a man-made world. But when one of them, who isn't shrewd and doesn't know how to fight, succumbs, the others realize that all their efforts to live as they desire do not get them anything. So they give up fighting and marry the men they love, regardless of monetary considerations.

The French, in offering \\"Rasputin\\" at the Fifty-fifth Street Playhouse as seventh of the screen's contradictory biographies of one of the world's most contradictory men, have wisely chosen not to pass judgment. They have been content to present the externals as objectively as they could and offer no explanation. Rasputin does not always make sense that way, but he becomes a fascinating subject for a screen biographer.Presented that way, without apology or revilement, Rasputin's fantastic career needs no fictional highlighting to make it engrossing drama. It needs only a player great enough to encompass the inconsistencies of the character within a unified performance so that the portrait will be not so much many-sided as multifaceted. If this seems to be hair-splitting, we might point out that Rasputin, according to the fairer biographers, was not a Jekyll and Hyde, alternately good or evil, but a man in ceaseless transition, in whom the angelic and the diabolic were constantly struggling. To have described him otherwise would have been over-simplification","excerpt":"that he has been described brilliantly is Harry Baur's all-important contribution to the film.Mr. Baur's Rasputin belongs to the great performances of the screen, for, in spite of the grossness of the actor's features themselves and the grossness of the \\"mad monk\\" he has portrayed, he has succeeded in communicating the paradoxical qualities of benevolence, spiritualism, kindliness and modesty that also were typically Rasputin's. That they should have existed at all in the soul of a man of such notorious excesses, coarseness, bestiality and hypocrisy is incredible enough; that they should endure on the screen as an afterglow to Baur's depiction of the monk's vulgarities and misdeeds is still more remarkable. Thus, at the film's end, Rasputin remains in doubt, a paradox and an enigma, typically \\"the holy devil.\\"The picture has been richly produced and most competently played by Jean Worms and Marcelle Chantal as the Czar and Czarina, by Jany Holt as the convent maid who was \\"exorcised\\" by the mystic by Martial Rebe as the Monk Cyril (apparently Illiodor), and by Pierre Richard Willm as Count Kourloff (Prince Youssupoff). The censors appear to have edited it most liberally, possibly still under the benumbing influence of the setback on \\"Harvest.\\" The liberality does them credit, for a scissors scar should have been no ornament to a dramatic and consistently interesting film biography of one of the strangest men of our century.

As Mr. Donovan has toiled in this contentious vineyard, he has been cheered on by the National Association of Manufacturers and denounced by the leaders of labor groups.   Corporate and Administration officials have praised him for cutting his department's budget by a third, for reducing its staff, and for no longer treating the Labor Department as a special lobbying office for the A.F.L.-C.I.O.

As action pictures go, this one has its exciting stretches for the conflict is not limited to Indians and soldiers.The scriptwriters quickly establish beyond any reasonable doubt that the squad chosen by Captain Lance for a suicide mission would just as soon kill their leader as they would Indians. None of them resents being called on to face the enemy at odds something like fifty to one. No sir. These are brawling roughnecks for the most part. They just don't like the captain who is a fine soldier but the kind of disciplinarian who throws the book at whoever steps out of line.You have met the type before and that is at once a disadvantage because you know that Captain Lance isn't a bad egg, really","excerpt":"that he is misunderstood and that eventually he will reveal himself to be quite human and even his worst enemies will admire him. Thanks to Gregory Peck's physical authority and his ability as an actor to imbue a synthetic character with a degree of conviction that would be lost to a lesser performer, the spectator is not, at least, overwhelmed by the banality of the plot.Gordon Douglas' direction is helpful, too, in creating and sustaining an atmosphere of threatening danger. This does much to cushion the absurd impression of soldiering that is created by the actions of Ward Bond, Lon Chaney, Neville Brand and Steve Brodie in particular. But don't blame the actors; they just read dialogue and, presumably, conduct themselves according to the wishes of the scenarists.Yet \\"Only the Valiant\\" does have its good qualities as melodrama. The tension runs high when Captain Lance and his seven deadly enemies take over an abandoned fort at the foot of a mountain pass through which the Apaches must come to reach the main fort further down the line. More than one attempt is made on the captain's life by his own men, but that old army spirit triumphs over personal grudges when the Indians attack.The director has staged a pip of a battle (or rather series of attacks) that reaches its climax when reinforcements arrive with a Gatling gun and the Apaches bite the dust in droves. If it does nothing else, \\"Only the Valiant\\" can be credited with helping to swell the population of the Happy Hunting Ground with Apaches.Gordon MacRae is starred in the Strand's stage show, which also features Buddy Lester, Grace & Nicco and Tony Pastor and orchestra.

He says he and Mr. Jones disagreed on how to play the role from the beginning of rehearsals, although Mr. Ostrow encouraged Mr. Silver to continue with his interpretation, saying that Mr. Jones did not understand American audiences. Mr. Silver also says that Mr. Ostrow discouraged discussion between him and the director","excerpt":"that he was promised rewrites of the third act that were never delivered; that he developed the flu three days before the first preview and could not go on, and that Mr. Ostrow insisted on opening the show by Dec. 26, because, he said, the Boston Globe critic Kevin Kelly had to review it before going on vacation.   Why the passion for Mr. Kelly's criticism? Mr. Silver says that at Mr. Ostrow's urging, he agreed to be interviewed by Mr. Kelly in New York City during the rehearsal period in the presence of the show's press agent, John Springer. Mr. Silver says he was not told that Mr. Kelly would be reviewing the show. He also says that Mr. Kelly was given the script before the play's opening and that Mr. Ostrow told the actor \\"things looked positive.\\"   Indeed, even without Mr. Silver, Mr. Kelly's review was a rave. The play fared less well in both Variety and The Boston Herald, which panned it.  But, it turns out, Mr. Kelly never went on vacation. \\"It's not true,\\" he says. \\"I can't imagine where that information came from. I wouldn't let a play like 'La Bete' be reviewed by someone else.\\"   While out-of-town reviews do little to influence New York critics, they are useful in raising much-needed money to bring a show to Broadway. At $2 million, it is the most expensive drama ever produced there, and Mr. Silver says Mr. Ostrow needed the money.   \\"Because I was sick, I asked Stuart to postpone, and he refused,\\" Mr. Silver says. \\"Since he was determined to open by the 26th, I got out of bed and rehearsed, and performed the night of the 22d. After that show, Stuart said the performance was terrific. The next morning at 9:30, I got a call to meet with him, the director and the author, and they told me they didn't want me to continue. The director wanted me to play the role as a vulgar homosexual -- fey, fleet, flouncy, which I found offensive. Maybe that's what the English find amusing, but I don't.\\"   Now, Mr. Silver says, negotiations are in progress between Mr. Ostrow and Sam Cohn, Mr. Silver's agent, on honoring the actor's six-month contract. In the event of dismissal, the contract calls for payment of Mr. Silver's weekly salary for the duration of the contract, not the four weeks Mr. Ostrow offered. Mr. Springer says Mr. Ostrow, Mr. Jones and Mr. Hirson decline to comment.   In retrospect, would Mr. Silver say he was miscast? \\"No,\\" he says emphatically. \\"Did I think I was good? No, not yet. But I would have been great if they had stuck with me, and we would have had a weightier play that meant something.\\" Where's the Mayor?     At least one constituency on Broadway is not pleased with Mayor David N. Dinkins. The cast of August Wilson's Pulitzer Prize-winning \\"Piano Lesson,\\" which opened in April, has repeatedly invited the Mayor to see the show, and he still hasn't come. The play, which also won the Drama Critics Circle Award, is to close on Jan. 27.   On Dec. 7, in the cast's third letter to the Mayor since June, the actors wrote: \\"Your allusion to New York City as a 'gorgeous mosaic' of people of all races and creeds applies to our entire nation, and no one has chronicled how African Americans sculpted their part in this mosaic with more passion or poetry than August Wilson.\\"   Tommy Hollis, a cast member, says: \\"Our show is about everything Mayor Dinkins says he wants to do. We have made tickets available to underprivileged audiences who have never come to the theater before. And ours is the first Broadway show to have profit-sharing with the actors who helped create it. Mayor Dinkins has been invited to celebrate this African-American playwright, and he doesn't have the time of day to come here? When we were in Los Angeles, Mayor Tom Bradley declared a 'Piano Lesson' Day because the man was proud of the play. Then I read in the papers here that Dinkins had declared an 'America's Most Wanted' Day\\" -- referring to a syndicated television program -- \\"and that was the last straw.\\"   Mr. Hollis says the actors are particularly upset because they requested time off from the show's rehearsals in New Haven to travel to New York and vote for Mr. Dinkins. \\"It's a slap,\\" he says.   Catie Marshall, an assistant press secretary to the Mayor, says: \\"He really wants to see this play, and so does his wife. The theater industry is very important to New York, and just because the Mayor is unable to attend a play doesn't mean he's not supportive of the industry.\\" Friends in High Places     One Government official who is extra-supportive of the theater industry is Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who came to Manhattan Theater Club's rescue last week. It seems that he is, of all things, a devotee of the English playwright Alan Ayckbourn. Rehearsals of Mr. Ayckbourn's \\"Absent Friends\\" began on Monday under the direction of Lynne Meadow. Most of the cast had already been set, including Peter Frechette and Mary-Louise Parker. But for the role of Diana, Mr. Ayckbourn \\"highly recommended\\" an English actress, Brenda Blethyn. But a visa delay meant Ms. Blethyn could not arrive here in time for rehearsals.   Ms. Meadow appealed to Senator Moynihan's office. With some fancy footwork from his staff member Lucille Loiselle, Ms. Blethyn's visa was obtained in two days. The Senator says, \\"I've always been a fan of Mr. Ayckbourn and look forward to seeing the production in New York.\\" On Stage, and Off"},{"year":"1955","title":"says he gave $2,600 in smoked sturgeon to 38 Govt workers","excerpt":"that he went into chicken-feather business with F Tartaglia, a supervisory mil-clothing specialist for QM Research and Development Command; subcom investigators rept Tartaglia invested $18,500; describe transaction in which Lev gave $4,000 to Tartaglia; Lev denial; Tartaglia suspended from job pending probe; Lev admits giving free caps to mil officers working in procurement; USAF files charges against Wool for permitting med bills to be paid for him by Govt contractors, falsifying travel vouchers and accepting gifts; Lev illus SMOKED STURGEON PUTS LEV ON GRILL; Cap-maker Admits Donating It to U.

The gist of Mr. Safire's argument, not easily discerned in the maze of political interests he evokes to underline the legitimacy of U.S.  opposition to the pipeline deal, is this:   The Europeans who contracted for gas may, when the gas begins flowing in 1984, have to pay more than the market price, which is now falling and may continue to fall.

There is a fine line, but a discernible one, between deliberately losing and not using one's best efforts to win. There is no evidence whatsoever that any club owner or official deliberately ''threw'' games.

Ratings and running times are in parentheses.    Now Playing    ''BIG FISH,'' starring Ewan McGregor, Albert Finney and Billy Crudup. Directed by Tim Burton (PG-13, 110 minutes). This soft, thin magic-realist fable concerns the fabulous (and largely self-fabricated) life of Edward Bloom, a garrulous Southerner played in his youth by Mr. McGregor and on his deathbed by Mr. Finney. Edward is a devoted teller of tall tales, which charms everyone except his son, Will (Mr. Crudup), who must overcome this estrangement before his father's death.

The Devils and the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, the team's landlord, are close to reaching an agreement that will keep the National Hockey League champions playing at Byrne Meadowlands Arena, two persons with knowledge of the talks said yesterday.   Officials from both sides met yesterday, starting at 9 A.M. But John Samerjan, an authority spokesman, last night dismissed speculation that a deal was done. \\"They're way ahead of themselves if they're saying that,\\" he said.   However, a third person familiar with the negotiations provided a broad outline of a proposed agreement on a renegotiated long-term lease.   It would not, the person said, include taxpayer money. Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, whose husband, John, helped bring the two once-feuding parties together, vowed not to permit tax dollars to be part of a save-the-Devils deal. But she had also promised to do whatever was necessary to avoid being tarred as the Governor who let the champions leave.   The deal would also include the addition of more high-priced club seats and luxury suites to satisfy the Devils' demands for more revenue at the arena, and an increase in what the Devils get from concessions and parking.    The team now gets 34.2 percent of gross revenue from luxury suites, concessions and parking","excerpt":"that is considered low by industry standards but more than what is received by the Nets, the Devils' co-tenant at the arena.   The arena has 29 luxury suites and can accommodate at least 40 more.   But the agreement will not allow the Devils to run the arena, as John McMullen, the team's owner, has wanted to do for many years. McMullen claims that the Devils lost $2 million during the past season, adding to an $18 million accumulated debt since he acquired the team in 1982.    He has flirted with moving to Nashville, where officials are offering to let him keep a $20 million relocation bonus, 97.5 percent of luxury suite sales and one-third of year-end profits at a new arena under construction.   The most palpable sign that negotiations were advancing came yesterday when the Devils and the authority agreed to postpone a hearing scheduled for this morning in Hackensack, N.J., before Superior Court Judge Peter Ciolino into the authority's request for a temporary restraining order to keep the team from terminating its lease. On June 27, the Devils said they would terminate their lease on July 6.   \\"I think this is positive, but you never know what's for certain until this is concluded,\\" said Alan Berman, a lawyer representing the Devils in talks with the authority. Both sides adjourned a similar hearing last Monday.   \\"They're still negotiating,\\" Berman added.   McMullen and Robert Mulcahy, the authority's president, accompanied the Devils yesterday to the White House for a Rose Garden ceremony honoring the Stanley Cup champions. But Lou Lamoriello, the team's president and general manager, remained behind all day to negotiate.   A deal, if concluded, would be a major breakthrough in the stormy relationship between the long-squabbling team and authority, which two weeks ago exchanged nasty allegations of deceit and bad-faith negotiations. The team said the authority had defaulted on its lease 13 different ways; the authority said the charges were concocted in an attempt to pack up for Nashville.   The drama over the Devils' future competed with the compelling story of their drive for their first-ever N.H.L. championship, which they achieved with a four-game sweep of the Detroit Red Wings. Would the former Colorado Rockies finally reach glory, only to be lured away by Tennessee with promises of untold wealth?   The long-contentious relationship between the team and the authority grew even worse, when, on the day the Devils won the title, they sent the authority notice that they would terminate their lease after the 1996-97 season. Then, on June 27, one day before a parade at the arena to celebrate winning the Stanley Cup, the team told the authority that it would terminate its lease on July 6.   But the recent tension in this landlord-tenant dispute was the outgrowth of a long-simmering feud that had been growing nasty since last December, when the authority suspended the team's lease during the N.H.L. lockout. The authority called it a technicality that was negated when the season began.   However, the team charged that the lease suspension was an attempt to deprive the team of its share of luxury suite revenue from non-hockey events.   That incident triggered the Devils' demand for an audit of authority finances to discover whether other revenues had been withheld over the past 13 years. The Devils claimed that at least $11 million had been held back, and charged the authority with being uncooperative in the audit.

Its subject is dipsomania, which is not an especially reputable one — particularly on the screen, where heavy drinkers are usually made out as clowns or just plain bums. But with Monty Woolley playing the leading character, a ones-famous actor turned lush, and Ida Lupino as his loyal daughter, who has been crippled since infancy, it becomes a quite tender topic, which is more often sad than laughable.Not grim, however","excerpt":"that is one thing a Monty Woolley film could hardly be, for the spark of his personality is enough to lighten any film he plays. And, in this particular picture it is the spirit of Mr. Woolley's character which elevates a generally morose story to a genial and tolerable plane. Indeed, the consistency of his character has been shaded just a bit now and then to permit him a little more levity and rebellion than might normally be in him. But that doesn't make too much difference; it is the resourcefulness of Mr. Woolley's old soak which makes \\"Life Begins at Eight-Thirty\\" a sentient and chucklesome film.For this is the tears-and-laughter story of a liquidated actor, now content to live with his idolizing daughter in a cheap New York boarding house. Archly, he plays upon her sympathies to keep things just as they are. But then, by a studied coincidence, she gets a suitor and he gets a chance to play \\"Lear\\" in a classy revival at precisely the same time. That raises rosy prospects, until the old boy discovers his little girl is going to marry her suitor, whereupon he gets slopped. \\"King Lear\\" goes out of the window, and so does matrimony—almost. But by a slightly ridiculous convenience, Mr. Johnson has wrought a happy ending.Before that, however, he has managed to indicate a psychological point to the old actor's dipsomania and bring some genuine pathos to the tale. Mr. Woolley plays the softer moments with quiet and affecting dignity, but it is when he is in his cups or dudgeons that he is most delightfully inspired. Then he roars and bridles with superlative arrogance and tosses off well-rounded insults like a man who has just dined on bitterest gall. Every dart that Mr. Johnson sharpened, Mr. Woolley has fervently hurled.Miss Lupino plays the crippled daughter with compassion and simplicity, and Sara Allgood stands off somewhat stiffly in the thankless role of an old friend. Cornel Wilde, a newcomer, betrays a trace of juvenility as the oddly impulsive young suitor, and Melville Cooper smirks a few times in a bit. But altogether they are second to Mr. Woolley in this film. For \\"Life Begins at Eight-Thirty\\" is essentially a picture to show him off as a lovable, gallant old drunkard.

She was born in England, brought up in a German-speaking household, and did not immigrate to the other hemisphere until 1959 (at the age of 36)","excerpt":"that is perhaps why the cultural landscape of this novel is essentially a European one, despite its Australian setting.   It is written in the form of a monologue - the voice that of Jacob, a quondam cellist whose hand has been so badly charred in an accident that he is now forced to earn a precarious living as a door-to-door salesman. The mood of the book, therefore, is one of bleakness and frustration, and almost at once Jacob's unhappy narrative reverts to ''the shuddering, muttering, mocking nightmare which belongs with childhood.'' This is a nightmare from which he has never been able fully to awake, however, and the opening sequences cast their shadows across the entire novel.

For the record, here are a few facts to counter Mr. Kane's fanciful assertions:   * Mr. Kane says the F.D.I.C. \\"is taking advantage of accounting and regulatory discretion to conceal from taxpayers the fact and depth of its insolvency.\\" The F.D.I.C. follows generally accepted accounting principles, and its financial statements are audited by the General Accounting Office and its own independent inspector general, as well as reviewed by appropriate Congressional committees. It would take a widespread conspiracy to achieve the deception Mr. Kane alleges.   * Mr. Kane contends that the F.D.I.C.'s problem bank list has been shrinking dramatically because of \\"accounting gimmicks\\" that mask the condition of the banks. The F.D.I.C. has reported that the assets of banks on the problem bank list increased to $409 billion at the end of 1990, the highest in F.D.I.C. history, up from $236 billion at the end of 1989. The F.D.I.C. is not fooled by accounting gimmicks and is not ignoring them when analyzing the actual condition of these institutions.   * Mr. Kane claims that the F.D.I.C. \\"controls the timing of individual bank failures\\" and that it unnecessarily delays bank closings, perhaps at great cost to the taxpayer. As a banking professor, Mr. Kane ought to know that the F.D.I.C does not decide when to close a bank","excerpt":"that is the decision of the state chartering authorities or the Comptroller of the Currency. The F.D.I.C., as well as other bank regulators, believes that nonviable banks should be resolved without delay.   Professor Kane's conspiracy theory about an F.D.I.C. that is misleading the public, his call for a law to impose \\"penalties of fraud\\" against Federal regulators who fail to make honest and timely reports of deposit insurance losses and his comparisons of the F.D.I.C. to the former Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation might make for good classroom dramatics, but bear little relation to reality.

Mrs. Jacob Politz, the mother, is frequently in a state of mental agony, and as the son is an upright, fine, young fellow, she appears to be making a mountain out of a mole hill.One of the high spots in this film is the dinner after the football game. Young Politz is the gridiron hero who saves the day for Strathmore University. Mrs. Politz not only goes to witness the game, but she gains entrance to the dining hall afterward as a waitress. Each time she thinks that her son might see her she conceals her face with a tray. And, of course, it is the campus flirt who scolds Mrs. Politz, with the result that Frank treats the girl in the same manner as this story has been handled—roughly.The inspiration for the title comes from the chapter in which Frank, wearing white flannel trousers, volunteers with others to go down the mine to the rescue of men caught in a cave-in.Louise Dresser is an exceptionally clever actress, but, as she has to live up to the director's instructions, her performance as the mother suffers. Jason Robards plays the son. He is quite sincere, but here again the director wants no mistake made about his being a hero on the football field and also in the mine. Virginia Browne Faire figures as the campus flirt.The Vitaphone features are far and away the most interesting part of the Colony program. First there is Herman Heller conducting a Vitaphone orchestra. This is followed by Sylvia Froos, who sings songs like \\"Where Did You Get Those Eyes?\\" and \\"I'm Telling the Birds.\\" John Barclay is to be heard and seen (in shadow form) in three numbers.

Indeed, there are times when the manufacturing process becomes so fascinating that one forgets the picture entirely and, rather gratefully, concentrates on the long strands of the fiber slipping smoothly through the carding machines, continuously, much as prison pictures slip through the vast conduits of the Warner studios.Jolly as the jute may be, however, the picture is still the more important commodity","excerpt":"that is why it is painful to have to report that it is of secondary quality. Tough as the Cagney-Raft combine was bound to be, it is not nearly so tough as the task of having to serve out a term in at least one Warner prison picture every month, with no time off for good behavior, though the fact that one has sat quietly through John Garfield's or Dick Foran's stretch last month, or the month before that, should certainly count for something in one's behalf.The story of Mr. Cagney's framing on a manslaughter charge by the powerful enemies he has made with his by-line newspaper exposes is one of the most wildly implausible of the year, but Mr. Cagney almost plays it plausibly, while Mr. Raft ably seconds him as the big-shot gangster who becomes his friend, and subsequent liberator, through familiar exigencies of a Warner prison term. In the end Mr. Raft's self-sacrifice is almost too noble to be borne—the only thing that enables one to bear it being one's previous experience of Mr. Raft, who refuses to play unsympathetic roles.At the Little CarnegieThe pitiful plight of a charming but irresponsible British baronet who can't hold on to his money, his family seat or the love of his wife is the feeble force which motivates whatever story there is in \\"The Ware Case,\\" an English film now showing at the Little Carnegie.

The veteran Sara Garcia is the middle-aged wife of a gay but dissembling ranch owner (Leopoldino Ortin). One of their sons (Julian Soler) is a medical student in the capital and the other (Miguel Montemayor) is tied to his mother's apron strings. The highly attractive Victoria Blanco is the vaudeville artist who turns the heads of both son and father.The high spot of the action comes when mother and son visit Mexico City in search of a putative daughter and sister and the boy is surrounded by a bunch of Victoria's pretty chorus-girl friends and cured of his shyness.

GOING OUT GUIDE"},{"year":"1990","title":"To the Sports Editor:   I am writing to clear up some misconceptions that your readers may have after reading \\"Debate Over a Proposed Park\\" by Jack Hope (The Times, Oct. 14).   One of Thomas Jorling's first acts as Commissioner of the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation was to study the impasse over the proposed Neversink River Unique Area, which had developed between the department and the principal landowner in the area, Benjamin Wechsler. Wechsler was the one who originally proposed the preservation of the beautiful Neversink River Gorge through public ownership many years ago. Commissioner Jorling made a comprehensive offer to resolve the dispute, which was never replied to.   The article contains some major omissions. It failed to mention that the cabins in question were located on state-owned land -- Wechsler owns only the hunting, fishing and trapping rights over this land. It neglected to state that the New York Appellate Division of the Supreme Court had ruled in 1989 that Wechsler has no right to maintain structures on this land. Acting under the authority of this court ruling, the department made a written request that Wechsler's lessees remove their possessions by a certain date, as a preliminary step to removing the structures.    The department acted to remove the personal property only after its requests were ignored and the date fixed had passed without action. Department representatives found the doors to the cabins unlocked and unsecured. The department has held this property for over a year to be claimed by its owners.   The column failed to mention that before the Appellate Division opinion referred to above, Wechsler excluded members of the public from the state-owned land on the theory that they interfered with his hunting and fishing rights. This was likewise rejected by the court. Since that time, the department has actively managed this property and held it open to public use with no problems.    Everyone concedes that the Gorge is fragile","excerpt":"that is why the department's proposal is for public ownership as a unique area, not a park. Public use would be limited to a level that is consistent with the preservation of the resources.   The column also suggested that the department has supplied misinformation to the press that \\"Wechsler was about to sell his land in the Neversink Gorge to a housing developer.\\" The facts that are in the public record speak for themselves.    There is presently filed against Wechsler's land in the Sullivan County Clerk's Office a legal notice known as a lis pendens. This will alert a title researcher that the title is in dispute, in this case because a New York City developer, Berne Investors Inc., contends that Wechsler has already signed a contract to convey all of this land and interests in the Neversink Gorge -- without, I might add, imposing any environmental restrictions whatsoever. Berne sued Wechsler to force performance of the contract. Wechsler moved to dismiss the suit; his motion to dismiss was denied, and denied again on appeal.   The Neversink Gorge is in a pristine condition now, despite increasing development pressure. Can we be sure that it will be in this condition 50 or 100 years from now? Public ownership and management is one answer to this problem. It assures a stability and security in the preservation forever of unique natural resources that individual private stewardship, no matter how well intentioned, cannot provide.

The Court also established an evidentiary standard that made it easier for black defendants to prove unconstitutional discrimination by prosecutors who exclude blacks from juries.   The case involves the use of a legal device, the peremptory challenge, to prevent seating a juror.

A few talk of forming survival groups and fleeing to the woods. Most, however, simply sit around weeping.    To these Democrats I say, Pull yourselves together. The recent Republican victory is not the worst blow to civilization since Attila the Hun popularized sacking and pillage. Not at all.    The unterrifying fact is that Republicans are no more inhuman than my Uncle Jack, of whom Aunt Pat used to say, \\"Jack's not tough, he just needs a shave.\\"    I have known Republicans from my cradle and and have never been bitten, or even sued, by a single one. Republicans are just like human beings, except for their demented conviction that repealing the capital-gains tax can save the world.     My Uncle Irvey was a Republican. He was a Southerner, but when Democrats ran the Catholic Al Smith for President in 1928, Uncle Irvey did not terrify neighborhood Protestants with warnings that a victorious Al Smith would move the Pope into the White House. The local Protestant Democrats did it for him.    Republicans are decent. One lent me the rent money once without asking collateral. A Republican is godmother to one of my children and has never sought to corrupt the child's faith by preaching salvation through repealing the capital-gains tax.     Republicans, in short, are not much different from people, so it is silly for Democrats to be terrified.     Think, Democrats, think. Your party has really been just a rudderless variation on the Republican party since Hubert Humphrey lost to Richard Nixon 25 years ago. After that the decline of the labor unions left it bereft of ideas, and its only Presidents have been those two old-fashioned Rockefeller Republicans: Carter and Clinton.    For evidence of the Democratic vacuum, how about that Rube Goldberg health-care bill the President offered? Republicans used to be called \\"me-tooers\\" because they couldn't think of much to do except go along with Democratic ideas.     Democrats are the new \\"me-tooers,\\" which is probably why \\"me-tooers\\" are now called \\"new Democrats.\\" President Clinton is a specimen \\"new Democrat\\"","excerpt":"that is, a Democrat who thought Eisenhower had it just about right.     You can tell \\"new Democrats\\" by their conviction that \\"liberalism\\" is their deadliest enemy and their lack of any ideas not likely to be approved by the better class of Republicans.    With Democrats now residing in the abandoned tents of the old Eisenhower Republicanism, why this Democratic panic about Republicans running Congress?     Well, it's the triumph of the Republican mossbacks of course: Gingrich, Helms, the Western right-wingers of the cowboy welfare states, all those Dixiecrats who used to be Democrats until Republicans became the white man's party. It's the same crowd that couldn't abide Nelson Rockefeller and would have chucked Eisenhower if he hadn't had such a way with the voters.    Newt Gingrich is the Republican who makes Democrats think of Walpurgis Night. With everybody talking about Gingrich's \\"first hundred days,\\" you might think he is the new Franklin Roosevelt risen out of Georgia to rebuild a stricken nation.    The unreality is intensified by Gingrich's announcement that he will not compromise in dealing with that lesser fellow who calls himself President. This is harmless nonsense, except that people who should know better take it seriously.    Gingrich, whose skill at mischief-making is considerable but whose talents for governance have not been tested, is doubtless blustering to cover the natural insecurity of a youngish gent in charge of a crew that hasn't sailed a ship for 40 years.    Democrats should allow the possibility that he is playing bad Captain Bligh just now, largely because he is shocked and maybe a bit scared to find himself in command.     What else explains his \\"no-compromise\\" declaration? It's institutionally impossible for Congress to lead. House members who desire the slightest accomplishment absolutely must compromise, and not just with Presidents, but also with Senates.    I should like to assure the Democrats that they have nothing to fear but fear-of-Newt itself, but that would mislead them. A party that doesn't stand for much has plenty to fear from one that stands for plenty, even when, as now, it looks like plenty of nothing.

It is a film whose style is very much its content, which, actually, is somewhat less revolutionary than a description of it makes it appear. I suspect that when Godard ultimately makes his most revolutionary movie, he will have found a way to dispense with camera, film, projector, screen and, perhaps, even audience. In \\"Le Gai Savoir\\" Godard is still communicating with us by means of beautiful, comparatively conventional, if fragmented, images and sounds.Godard is in the same position as Marshall McLuhan, who can only proclaim the end of the old era by means of the old","excerpt":"that is, by placing one word after another in linear sequence. Godard must proselyte for his revolutionary cause in the essentially bourgeois cinema medium in which image and word, though placed on top Of each other, must also flow from one to the other, thus immediately assuming a formal structure even when the flow is dictated by chance. Godard, however, seldom makes films by chance.\\"Le Gai Savoir\\" is a very formal film, but one that makes no pretense to having a narrative. A young man, Emile Rousseau (Jean-Pierre Leaud), and a pretty, intense girl, Patricia Lumumba (Juliette Bertho), are in a television studio ostensibly making a film but actually having a discourse on language, \\"the enemy,\\" the weapon by which the capitalist establishments confuse liberation movements. Because words condition behavior, they say, man can only free himself by destroying words and their old associations, then building a new, fresh vocabulary.Like Nana, Veronique, Natasha von Braun, Ulysses, Michelangelo and so many other Godard characters, Emile and Patricia exist in a void, which this time is visual. As they stand, sit, pose, circle one another, they are the only figures to be seen in a liquid black limbo. They are not, however, really removed from a cultural tradition and heritage. Their discourses are packed with literary and film references—Bertrand Russell, Faulkner, Bertolucci, Robinson Crusoe (\\"a fascist\\"), Cohn-Bendit, Burroughs, Cahiers du Cinema.At the same time, the camera is constantly cutting to points of visual references—Paris streets, cartoon strips, pop posters—images, which, though fragmented, make complete sense. At one point, the camera moves in to play a word association game with a small boy. Being, in effect, pure, the boy gives responses that illustrate the goal sought by Emile and Patricia. The same game played with an old man brings forth nothing but a lot a quite comic, inanely complex, responses, all, of course, pre-conditioned.Although I must admit that I found great patches of \\"Le Gai Savoir\\" literally \\"joyful wisdom\\" almost unbearably dense and obscure, it is one of Godard's most beautiful, most visually lucid movies, even when the screen goes completely black (key footage, we are told, has been censored) and the whispered dialogue is translated in hypnotically white subtitles.The movie also is full of puns and typically Godardian whimsey. At the end of a filming session in the TV studio, Emile announces he is off to steal the dreams of two Pop stars to sell to the tabloids, the money from which will go to the revolutionary cause. Patricia admits that she earns extra money by posing for lingerie ads for L'Humanité.Rumors from film circles in Europe to the effect that Godard has gone completely off the cinematic deep end are, I think, dispelled by this film. \\"Le Gai Savoir\\" certainly is abstract beyond anything he has done before, but its discourses are simple (or not so simple) extensions of ideas that he has been playing with in films like \\"Les Carabiniers\\" \\"Alphaville,\\" \\"La Chinoise,\\" \\"Made in U.S.A.\\" and \\"Weekend.\\" \\"Le Gai Savoir\\" is a sort of finale to those films — where he goes from here, I can't imagine.

A. \\"It is extremely toxic,\\" said Dr. Larry J. Thompson, a clinical toxicologist in the College of Veterinary Medicine at Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y.\\"It is one of the most toxic plants on anyone's list.\\"   Dr. Thompson said that even a few leaves falling into a small ornamental pool could poison a dog who lapped water from the pool.    All parts of the plant are considered toxic, he said, with the seeds usually the most toxic, the leaves a little less and the flowers least, but still dangerous. Even the stems are dangerous, he said, and there are anecdotal reports of children poisoned by hot dogs roasted over a fire of the stems. Adults have been poisoned by consuming one leaf.   The widely used ornamental bush comes in two species, Nerium oleander, the common pink oleander planted in California in the space dividing Interstate highways, and the yellow oleander, Thevetia peruviana.    Both contain cardioactive glycosides, which are similar in effect to digitalis but much more toxic, Dr. Thompson said. They can be quickly fatal. Besides disrupting the heart function, they cause gastrointestinal symptoms like vomiting and diarrhea.    Extreme care should be taken with oleander plants and trimmings around people or animals, Dr. Thompson said. Well-fed animals will not usually seek out oleander leaves, but some may accept them despite their bitter taste and consume enough to be harmed. Those most at risk would be naive animals new to an area, or perhaps a horse who is attacted to trimmings thrown over the pasture fence.  Perfect Shuffle    Q. What is a perfect shuffle?   A.

She has to go to work as a stewardess, and, as she happens to be particularly predisposed to sea-sickness, she is seldom happy during the first few days. Then the villain, with a new Panama hat and a well-trimmed moustache, decides to enlist Margie as a help to get some of William Finch's money.\\"His name's Cinch,\\" says Dunrock, the rogue.Yvonne Dorée, the blond who admires Dunrock and helps him swindle his victims, also believes that Finch has made his wealth rather through luck than by brains.

The competitive hustle of sports today is amusingly sent up by Lee Walton, a conceptual artist, who pits himself against the basketball superstar Shaquille O'Neal. For every free throw attempted by Shaq in the course of the current N.B.A. season, Mr. Walton tries one himself -- at a special basketball hoop set up in the gallery -- hoping to beat Shaq's percentage. The results are carried on Mr. Walton's Web site (viewable in the gallery). Basketball is also the topic in ''He Got Game,'' above, a fool-the-eye photograph by the performance artist Robin Rhode.

(Social scientists sometimes forget that.) ''Islands of History'' contributes to the most important trends of current social thought. Those trends include the move toward a more historical anthropology, seen also, for example, in Eric Wolf's ''Europe and the People Without History''; the interest in understanding historical process as itself culturally shaped, as exemplified in Clifford Geertz's ''Negara'' and Michel Foucault's ''History of Sexuality''; and the growing awareness of culture as not only historically produced, but even sometimes consciously constructed, a point developed most recently in a provocative collection called ''The Invention of Tradition,'' edited by Eric Hobsbawm and Terence Ranger.

On the other hand, however, there's long been little love returned for Houston, the state's biggest city and the nation's fourth largest. Houston doesn't have a clear-cut positive reputation, like Austin (the laid-back slacker capital), or even a good nickname, like Dallas (Big D). As far as most of the country is concerned, it's got Enron and robber baron oilmen and heavy people, all in a climate requiring enough air-conditioning to power a rocket ship to Neptune. But Houston also has extraordinary museums, an innovative alternative arts and hip-hop scene, a rapidly growing cache of upscale hotels and haute cuisine and the neighborliness to take in tens of thousands of people displaced by Hurricane Katrina. And, of course, it has rocket ships","excerpt":"that is, NASA's Johnson Space Center. In the end, maybe that's what makes Houston such an unusual and wonderful place -- there are so many different Houstons to see.    DAN HALPERN    Friday    6 p.m.  1 -- The Goode Ribs    Haute cuisine -- sure, that's nice. But do what Texans who have been exiled to other parts of the country do when they return home: get yourself some barbecue as fast as you can. Make a stop at Goode Company Barbeque (5109 Kirby Drive, 713-522-2530), above, for some ribs and potato salad and jalapeño beans ($8.95) immediately. Do not skip the beans. Do not check into your hotel first. Get off the plane and go straight there, say hello to the buffalo head on the wall and eat as many barbecued meats as you possibly can. The Goode family is a Houston restaurant dynasty that has a number of places around town. For a less dynastic experience, try Thelma's Bar B Que (1020 Live Oak Street, 713-228-2262). Look for the little red and white house, and don't hesitate.    9 p.m.  2 -- Honky-Tonk Heroes    It's time to meet some loveable losers and no-account boozers. Or, as the country music anthem says, time to meet some honky-tonk heroes. Try Blanco's Bar & Grill (3406 West Alabama Street, 713-439-0072), where live country acts on Thursdays and Fridays set everyone to dancing. Or go on a Wednesday for open-mike night. But if you're going to try to sing ''Honky-Tonk Blues'' in front of the crowd, have a Lone Star beer first. During the rest of the week, the jukebox plays classic country, but you can still dance all you want.    Saturday    9 a.m.  3 -- Republic of Art    Houston has a passel of world-class art collections to offer, so start early. At the Museum of Fine Arts (1001 Bissonnet Street, 713-639-7300), above, you can see excellent temporary exhibitions -- a huge Basquiat show will continue through mid-February -- as well as everything from Rembrandt to Brancusi, Egyptian sarcophagi to Monet. A short drive away, the Menil Collection (1515 Sul Ross Street, 713-525-9400) offers an extraordinary private collection open to the public since 1987. The Surrealist installation is particularly good; make sure to check out the room with objects that belonged to the Surrealists -- just past the three extraordinary Joseph Cornell boxes -- a collection of odd, lovely found art. (If lost, just look for the Wildman costume, an alarming-looking leather body-suit covered in wood and metal spikes.) Afterward, drive south to take a walk through renovated Hermann Park (look for the huge fountain at the north tip on Hermann Drive) and say hello to the monument to Sam Houston, the first president of what was, from 1836 to 1845, the independent Republic of Texas.    1 p.m.  4 -- Serve It With Soul    For a taste of Cajun and soul food, stop by Claudia and Brian Nickerson's Soul on the Bayeaux (3717 Dowling Street, 713-528-0732), in the heart of Houston's Third Ward, a neighborhood just seeing the beginnings of renewal and development. Look for the gator. Dishes include blackened catfish ($11.95) and crayfish étoufée ($9.95), with okra and corn, mustard greens or collard greens on the side. In season, consider the fried alligator appetizer ($5.95) if you think you can handle it.    3 p.m.  5 -- Watts Towers of Houston    In the 1950's, a postman named Jefferson D. McKissack decided to make something to honor his favorite fruit, and the Orange Show Center for Visionary Art is the result (2402 Munger Street, 713-926-6368). Enter and wander around the structure, which is like walking through a fantastic, gigantic orange jungle gym made from scrap metal and brick and tile, its ingredients taken from everything from farm equipment to old fencing. It took Mr. McKissack almost 25 years to put it together; in 1980 it became part of a nonprofit foundation and a focal point for Houston's folk arts scene. Make sure to take a look at one of the Orange Show's sister projects, the Beer Can House (222 Malone Street), which is inlaid with marbles, rocks, brass figures and metal pieces and covered in, yes, pieces of beer cans.    5:30 p.m.  6 -- Boîte With a History    Called the Kennedy Bakery when it opened in 1860, La Carafe (813 Congress Street, 713-229-9399) once served as a stop on the Pony Express. Now it's a dark, comfortable wine bar with excellent selections of wine and beer and a good downtown stop before an evening out. The hazy front window creates an eerie but comforting sort of late afternoon.    7 p.m.  7 -- In the Bank    All right, the haute cuisine. Since around the time the first oil derrick was erected on Texas soil, there have been plenty of Houstonians with loads of money -- and a lot of places where they can spend it. Bank Jean-Georges, in the Hotel Icon (220 Main Street, 832-667-4470), is one of the newest restaurants in Jean-Georges Vongerichten's growing culinary empire (his restaurants include spots in New York, Paris, Hong Kong and Las Vegas). The black pepper crab dumplings with snow peas ($13) are superb; the seared foie gras with ginger and mango ($18) is, obviously, entirely decadent. Feel free to have any of his fish dishes, but this is Texas, so really, stay with cattle: try the grilled tenderloin with onion jam and sour plum mustard ($33).    9 p.m.  8 -- All in One    You can't argue with an art space that serves liquor and puts on both rock shows and oil wrestling. Helios (411 Westheimer Road, 713-526-4648) is host to everything from jazz to bluegrass, various performances, art exhibitions, poetry readings and parties on two levels (and a sort of amphitheater in the back) in a big old yellow house just off one of the main nightlife drags. (Dismayingly, the oil wrestling is not, apparently, a regular gig.) Try the Night Helios, a combination of Bacardi 151 rum, orange liqueur and lemon juice.    Sunday    8 a.m.  9 -- 24 Horas Cada Dia    Whoever invented huevos rancheros ought to get a medal. Get your eggs, salsa, beans, potatoes, bacon and tortillas ($4.95) at Chapultepec (813 Richmond Avenue, 713-522-2365), a low-budget Mexican kitchen. Houstonians might rate a number of other Mexican restaurants higher, but Chapultepec has by way of advantage the fact that it's open 24 hours and, thus, has some of the weirdest, most talkative patrons in the city. At breakfast you're likely to be eating with teenage punk rockers, day laborers and sundry other assorted brands of early-morning owls who either rise before the sun or who haven't gone to bed yet. (Chapultepec has two slogans: ''Where Everyone is Beautiful,'' as well as ''Where Beautiful People Meet.'')    10 a.m.  10 -- Space Is the Place    If for no other reason, go to Space Center Houston, about 25 miles south of downtown, just so at the slightest provocation -- for instance, if you get lost on the way -- you can say, ''Houston, we have a problem.'' Repeat this until spouse or traveling companion begins to hit. Take a NASA Tour, which includes visits to real working areas of the Johnson Space Center, as well as Rocket Park and shuttle mission simulators. (1601 NASA Parkway, 281-244-2100.

The Hotel Icon (220 Main Street, 713-224-4266; www.hotelicon.com) mixes boutique and classic hotel style, and its bar, the Whiskey, is one of Houston's trendiest.

Mr. Reed is far more successful with a Parisian background than he was with one of London in the film version of \\"The Ace of Cads,\\" or one of this city in his melodrama hailed as \\"New York.\\" His direction of this new subject is smooth and even, without any extraneous cinematic effects.In a short sequence Mr. Menjou is dressed in riding togs and wears a beard, but most of the time he is clean shaven, as usual, and is clad in a dress suit, which until he is caught in a rainstorm is as immaculate as one that had only been worn for five minutes. Because the bailiff, Baron Lazarre, insists on taking his pearl stud, Lucien (M. Menjou) puts pencil marks on his shirt front to make up for the missing article.Lucien is in turn deliberate, dazed and dejected, when he is hopeful of somebody else paying for his dinner. The individual upon whom he relies for the meal happens to be intensely interested in a gay Parisienne, and therefore Lucien is never quite sure what's going to happen.

Van Dine's mystery story. \\"The Greene Murder Case,\\" which was installed at the Paramount yesterday, is an ingenious individual who, it might seem, would never for a moment think of snuffing out a life without careful reference to books on past murders. One might almost fancy this criminal talking over the proposed killing with a victim before going about the deed. But this callous, studious specimen of humanity does not count on the police calling for the assistance of the superbly analytical mind of Philo Vance. To commit a crime anywhere near where Vance happens to be is like putting one's neck voluntarily into the noose.\\"The Greene Murder Case,\\" mechanical though its technique is, happens to be fortunate in holding the interest, in keeping its secret well covered and in giving the spectators intermittent periods of amusement. The fun is furnished chiefly by Police Sergeant Heath, whose brain is as blunt as Philo Vance's is sharp. Heath has an impressive voice, which leads one at first to suppose that he may turn out to be a master mind","excerpt":"that is, provided one did not see him in the screen version of \\"The Canary Murder Case.\\" This numskull of a sleuth is portrayed by that competent actor, Eugene Pallette, who sees to it that Heath is always on the wrong track.As usual in such murder mysteries, there are several persons at whom the finger of suspicion is pointed, but whom one does not believe to be guilty because it is reasonably certain that they have only been signaled out by the author and the director to mislead the spectator. The girl with the religious mania might have had a hand in the crime. Likewise, the perfect butler; also the girl who would die rather than utter a bromidic phrase, the German housekeeper, the sour old invalid and lastly, the Austrian doctor.Philo Vance permits the audience to hear snatches of his deductions, but never enough to help in the solution of the murder mystery before Mr. Vance gives the full details. So far as Mr. Vance is concerned, it might be said that he was born under a lucky star, for it is quite obvious that Mr. Van Dine or somebody guides his mind and his movements.William Powell does very well as Mr. Vance, a part he played also in \\"The Canary Murder Case.\\" Florence Eldridge, Ullrich Haupt and E.

THE SCREEN"},{"year":"1928","title":"With the exception of the work of those who portray the juvenile rôles, the acting in the Universal picture \\"Give and Take\\" is most competent. The audible side of this production is technically uneven and the lines spoken by the players are rather reminiscent of the old-fashioned subtitles. The comedy amused quite a number of persons in the Colony Theatre yesterday afternoon, but it is of the variety that causes some of the characters to be too stupid, even for a farce.In the talking passages the players appear to be reciting rather than conversing. There are many spots where the long silences cause one to feel that the people in the story are waiting for the sound wizards to unlock their tongues.There isn't the least doubt but that with an intelligently written photoplay, actors like Sam Hardy, George Sidney and Jean Hersholt would make things very interesting","excerpt":"that is, provided the technical end was improved. Mr. Hardy's voice is especially pleasing in this long-winded yarn. Both Mr. Sidney and Mr.Hersholt have, in this film, been called upon to say and do so much that is silly that one is apt to experience some slight irritation during a number of these banal episodes.The basic idea of the story may be none too original, but it could have been worked out with suspense and occasional shafts of wit. George Sidney impersonates Albert Kruger, the old partner and friend of John Bauer, played by Jean Hersholt. Just when things look black for Bauer, Kruger and the factory, in steps a Mr. Craig, who talks in millions and has big ideas. A contract is signed with him for the factory output for some time to come. You imagine that the story is soon coming to an end, but it is then brought out that Mr. Craig has been incarcerated in the psychopathic ward of some institution, so once more the joy is killed. In the end. however, the cheery author decides to make Mr. Craig sane and therefore all ends in the usual serene fashion. THE SCREEN; Hesitant Talkers."},{"year":"1921","title":"\\"Carnival,\\" the photoplay at the Capitol this week, employs the old theatrical trick of having an actor go through a scene in a play within a play which corresponds in its main points with a situation in what is represented as the actor's real life. Even today the device has dramatic possibilities, and there is no objection to it if it is plausibly developed and carried to its logical conclusion, but it has lost its effectiveness as a trick, except for those to whom it is still something of a novelty. Such may be impressed by its use in \\"Carnival.\\" Others are not likely to be, for it does not meet the requirements. It's just a stunt.The play within the play is \\"Othello.\\" The scene is the murder of Desdemona. Silvio Steno is a Venetian actor whose wife, Simonetta, plays opposite him. After numerous scenes in which the intent of the playwright is made obvious through the stupidity of the principal characters, Steno comes to his opening night in \\"Othello\\" believing that his wife has been faithless. So when the time comes for him to murder Desdemona he starts in to kill Simonetta, but, being a modern movie hero instead of a Shakespearean character, he does not complete the job. The people backstage know what is coming as well as the spectators of the picture and drag him away before any serious damage is done. Then comes the reconciliation between husband and wife, which could have come at any point selected by the playwright. It's all too theatrical to be dramatic. And too wordy to be cinematographic.It may be objected that the public does not like tragedy and that the authors of \\"Carnival\\" are justified therefore in giving it a happy ending. But if the public insists on happy endings, why don't the producers of pictures use stories that can logically end happily? Near-tragedy is no more satisfying than near-beer. But frosted chocolate satisfies many—and it's genuine.In some respects, let it be added, \\"Carnival\\" is genuine, too. A number of its scenes, though entirely surrounded by words, are excellent in themselves, and the picture as a whole has been authentically as well as elaborately staged. Also Matheson Lang, who takes the part of the actor, is a fine figure of a man and able to express himself on the silent screen. He gives the impression that he could really play Othello and Steno in a better-built motion picture. Hilda Bailey, as his wife, is not as vivid as she might be, but she is still sufficiently intense to animate her character, and Clifford Gray, as her trouble-making brother, gives about the most convincing performance of them all. Ivor Novelle, as the object of Steno's jealousy, is rather neutral, but good looking and a likely lover. Harley Knoles directed the production.The picture is introduced by a musical prologue called \\"Carnival,\\" in which Erik Bye and a mixed quartet sing, and the orchestra plays selections from \\"Thaïs\\" to accompany Jacques Gordon and Mlle. Fanny Rezia.The screen version of Edward Sheldon's play, \\"Salvation Nell,\\" at the Strand this week, depends so much on words for its action and sags so beneath the weight of more and superfluous words intended, no doubt, to be read out loud to blind persons unable to see the pictures, that it can hardly be called a cinema composition. And yet it has several good things in it which may be enjoyed separately.First of all, there is the acting of Pauline Starke in the title rôle. Miss Starke has been making her presence felt on the screen for some time, and she seems equal to any part assigned to her. She is a real screen actress, able to give character to the fictitious person she is supposed to be. She can be quiet and pathetic without becoming colorless, and she can be emotional without running wild. Some of her scenes in \\"Salvation Nell\\" are gripping.Joseph King, as the drunken Jim Platt, gives a properly and definitely vigorous performance, while Charles McDonald and the others chosen as types suit their rôles well. Gypsy O'Brien is also true to life as Nell's easy-going friend.With some exceptions the scenes are all exceptionally well made","excerpt":"that is, realistically set and effectively lighted. Kenneth Webb, who directed the production, appears to have given a great deal of attention to the composition of his pictures, and quite a number of them, taken by themselves, are convincing. They are literalism at its best. They are robbed of much of their strength, however, by the verbal placards put upon them and do not as a whole compose a strong, smoothly moving photoplay.Most people will remember the story of \\"Salvation Nell\\" from Mrs. Fiske's appearance in it on the stage. As transferred to the screen it rather melodramatically tells of the rescue of a street waif by the Salvation Army and of the ultimate redemption of her man.\\"The Skipper's Narrow Escape,\\" a Toonerville comedy, is also at the Strand, and the musical program includes selections from \\"Robin Hood,\\" played by the orchestra, and a vocal prologue to the photoplay sung by the theatre's Ladies' Quartet.\\"The Bronze Bell,\\" with Courtenay Foote and Doris May, is at the Rivoli this week, and \\"Wealth,\\" with Ethel Clayton, is at the Rialto. \\"The Golem\\" remains at the Criterion.\\"The Old Nest,\\" directed by Reginald Barker from a story by Rupert Hughes, will open at the Astor Theatre on Tuesday evening.

Home Improvement"},{"year":"1926","title":"Within the soft-carpeted marble halls of the Paramount Theatre a none too edifying film is occupying the screen. It is labeled \\"Love 'Em and Leave 'Em,\\" being based on the play of the same name by John V. A. Weaver and George Abbott. It deals with shop girls, window-dressers and a race track tout and, except for a few sequences, it cannot be accused of possessing any vast degree of imagination. The players go through their respective rôles obediently, but they do not seem to be much concerned about the situations nor the story. Hence there are tears that don't induce sadness and laughter that is not contagious. The title writer has endeavored to make the most of certain incidents and sometimes he has succeeded.The first names of the characters are Mame, Janie, Bill and Lem. Bill, the unintelligent hero, is introduced by a caption which describes him as \\"a ninety-million-to-one-shot for President.\\" He at first presides over a section of the men's hat department, and the way in which he goes about his work is very much like a motion-picture actor, pretending that he is a salesman but being at the same time keenly eager that every little girl and every little boy understands that he was not cut out for that sort of thing.And then there is Janie, who is Chairman of the Welfare League of the department store. Her great bent in life is to be a dancer, and she takes advantage of the opportunity offered by the Welfare League mask ball.Lem, as one might surmise, is the race-track tout. He tempts Janie to risk a few dollars of the Welfare League funds on a horse. And when she loses she pays, but when she wins Lem tells her that he did not get a chance to place the bet.Mame is the sensible girl","excerpt":"that is, she is sensible until she decides to marry Bill. She is wrongly accused of stealing money, but because of a promise she shields Janie.Some of the ideas of window dressing are good, and more ought to have been made of the \\"What Every Woman Knows\\" glimpses. Mame is a girl with ideas and Bill is just tidy and most meticulous about how much handkerchief hangs out of his breast pocket. He profits by Mame's intelligence and is promoted to be a window-dresser.Evelyn Brent is the shining light of the cast. She does as well as she has been permitted to.

Produced in Italy with an Italian and French-speaking cast, \\"Fabiola\\" has been extensively re-edited and equipped with a new story line by Marc Connelly and Fred Pressburger for its American presentation. The dialogue, spoken in English and written by Forrest Izard, was dubbed in by unbilled actors and synchronized with the lip movements of Michele Morgan, Henri Vidal, Michel Simon, Gino Cervi and Massimo Gerotti, who play the principal roles.The work of the American adapters was so extensive that there is no way of telling what merit \\"Fabiola\\" may have had as it was originally written and directed by Alessandro Blasetti from the old novel by Nicholas Cardinal Wiseman. All one can do is judge by what now appears on the screen. To say that \\"Fabiola\\" is an eye-filling production, with sweeping scenes of pageantry and surging passages of brutality, is no exaggeration of the evidence at hand. By the same token, however, it should be recognized that the ultimate impression made by \\"Fabiola\\" is that of a gradiose dramatic hodgepodge.Able dramatist that he is, Mr. Connelly has not succeeded in writing a cohesive and clear-cut narrative to give substance and significance to the struggle between the early Christians and their pagan oppressors. Therein lies a monumental drama of uncompromising conflict on both spiritual and social planes, a herculean clash of forces, which, unfortunately, becomes somewhat confused and dissipated in the adapters' striving to project the drama through the personalities of two young lovers.This is the great and confusing weakness of the picture, for Fabiola, daughter of the influential Senator Fabius Severus who champions the Christians, and Rhual, gladiator and secret emissary of Emperor Constantine, are not characters of heroic proportions, and their misunderstanding follows a conventional emotional pattern.As the picture opens, an off-screen narrator establishes the historic backdrop and heralds the approach to Rome of Constantine's liberating army. Like the United States cavalry in Hollywood's winning-of-the-West movies, Constantine's boys don't show up until the fadeout, by which time the good Fabius has been murdered by the Prefect's agents and the poor Christians have been blamed for the foul deed to the patron who had promised them freedom from slavery in his will.Considerable time is wasted in actions and words of dubious interest before the main business of the picture is approached","excerpt":"that is, the persecution of the Christians in the arena by floggings, burning at the stake, beheadings and, grizzly pièce de résistance, tossing the victims to the voracious lions.Michele Morgan as Fabiola is an alabaster-like representation of distraught, cold beauty; Henri Vidal is muscular and athletically competent as the daring Christian gladiator, and Michel Simon is bluff and hearty as Fabius.

Lincoln's novels have attained their popularity because he knows how to make the folks down on Cape Cod real to his readers. His stories have the flavor of life in them, and this flavor is derived as often from the quaintness and humor the author sees about him as from the sterner virtues. What his characters do is often less important than how they do it.The producers of the film version of \\"Rugged Water,\\" shown at the Rialto this week, seem to have forgotten that. They have again made the mistake that is so often made when a novel is translated to the screen","excerpt":"that is, they have taken the obvious outline of the story and let the color go by default. The result is, as always, a somewhat wooden narrative. Events in the life-saving service at Setuckit Station and the village of Orham move rather by schedule than by inspiration.If Lincoln had written all his novels as they have screened this one, Cape Cod would not be as well known in Medicine Hat and points West as it is today and the author would not be a best-seller. With certain honorable exceptions the movies today seem unaware of the fact that almost anybody can put together a story but that it takes an artist to install the interior decorations that make it carry conviction. When they get to understand that better they will know, for instance, why so many people rave about \\"The Last Laugh\\" and forget the comic notion that it is because the film was made without sub-titles.So this is a down-shore picture in which the sea air is not salt and the folks are not folks, but just persons. Indeed, the lack of sufficient characterization is, in one instance, so conspicuous as to interfere with the proper telling of the story. One questions seriously whether audiences will think the pivotal character of Cap'n Bartlett anything but grotesque. His antecedents have not been sufficiently explained. The book amply prepares the reader for his collapse into religious dementia. The film does not. From the book we know that this life-saver from another station thrust upon Setuckit as commander by political manipulation carries a scar on his soul left by a terrible experience. The film carries no adequate suggestion of that, and the actions that are revealed are therefore lacking in conviction.Within its limitations, however, the film gives a fairly consistent story, if we ignore the deficiency in the character of Cap'n Bartlett. And it is a fairly interesting one. Another merit is that it exploits a setting that is out of the ordinary. Further, its motives and incidents are drawn from real life, as far as they go, which is important in these days of artificiality in the movies. The acting is satisfactory throughout. Lois Wilson and Warner Baxter meet the not exacting demands of the principal rôles and Phyllis Haver and Dot Farley are excellent as the village siren and her scheming mother.

This includes the use of insulation, weatherstripping, storm windows and caulking, all materials that prevent or minimize the flow of heat in or out.

And incidentally there is far too much levity on the part of one of the characters ever to make this an effective tragedy.The harem sequences in the desert are so forced and out of place that they almost cause one to forget the beauty of the production in the preceding episodes. Mr. Hawks gives a splendid if romantic conception of the heart affair between Fabienne and Fazil","excerpt":"that is, until Fabienne follows her wandering husband to his native sands.There is a sequence in which is depicted the joy of life of the young couple. There are flashes of automobiles speeding recklessly along highways, of a motorboat tossing up spray and looking as if it were going to crash into a big ship, of the pleasure of swimming and diving, horseback riding, and so forth. These glimpses give the picture up to that point the aspect of a Richard Harding Davis story.You see Fazil and the pale Parisienne dancing on the well-waxed floors of a hotel in the French capital, and, to show that they are utterly oblivious to the other couples surging around them, Mr. Hawks suddenly sweeps away the crowd and leaves only the two dancers. Then he brings them back to consciousness, or at least the reality of the occasion.But the fervent follower of Allah appears to be between the devil and the deep sea, or, his European wife and the traditions of his race. He dreams of Fabienne, does this Fazil, after he has left the French lily for women of his own land. His affection is then not particularly impressive, and subsequently after he tells his harem to pack up and leave, he finds, that it behooves him to have an Eastern wife as well as his French bride.It is a picture that gives Greta Nissen, as Fabienne, a chance to wear stunning costumes, whether she is in Italy, France or Arabia. Charles Farrell, as Fazil, is perceived in European and Arabian attire. And there's no doubt that he makes a handsome Arab. His dark skin is contrasted with the whiteness of Greta Nissen's attractive countenance. The two make an excellent pair.Prior to the screening of the main feature some interesting Movietone subjects were displayed. Several of these productions gave one a healthy idea of the power of the synchronization of sound and shadow. There was a football game in England, at which 93,000 persons were heard singing; President Coolidge was heard and seen delivering part of his recent Gettysburg address; stage comedians in shadow form created considerable laughter and the steps of a dancer were heard.The hearing and seeing of President Coolidge in the Movietone film caused one to reflect that the Chief Executive of the United States will be heard and seen arguing against war in the most remote corners of he earth.

Even the main title, the cast of players and the names of those who have contributed to the making of this audible film are announced from the screen by the shadow of a masked man.While this mystery melodrama is by no means without its shortcomings, it is an emphatic improvement over any other pictures of its type, the faults being chiefly due to the manner in which the performers speak their lines and not to the Vitaphone device. There are, however, at least two of the actors who give an excellent account of themselves. They are Edward Everett Horton and Otto Hoffman.With all the shrieks, hushes and other sounds that come from the screen, this spooky story is not one that sends a chill down the spines of the spectators. But it is interesting for the most part and the dénouement has its points. The utterances of the characters are always distinct, but in one or two respects they \\"overload the machinery,\\" particularly the stentorian tones of Joseph Girard, who figures as a Scotland Yard inspector. Each time he opens his mouth to say a word one almost dreads the consequences. His is a voice to make the guilty quake! On the other hand May McAvoy's voice is shy and shrinking, a lisping peep contrasted with the bellowing of Mr. Girard.There are others whose voices do not fail them, but whose speaking rather reminds one of a young recitationist. They fail to give the lines the proper inflection and the result is that their minds do not seem to be on what they are saying. In most cases, however, the performers suit the action to the words better than the players did in the talking version of \\"The Lion and the Mouse.\\"Roy Del Ruth has shrewdly combined good motion picture ideas with the sound incidents. His direction of the talking of the players, however, is another matter. With Mr. Horton and Mr. Hoffman he had an easier task, but with most of the others the speech comes forth as if by command and with a tardiness that is hardly natural. It also seems as if Miss McAvoy had somebody else do the screaming for her, as the screams at various junctures are far louder than one would expect from Miss McAvoy after hearing her modest attempts at speech.The lines given to the players, in some instances, could easily have been improved upon, but as it is a mystery photoplay in which queer things happen, the producers may contend that fright had an effect upon the characters","excerpt":"that it also accounts for the slow uptake of the words and various other seeming deficiencies.The story concerns a weird character who hides in a strange house. He has all sorts of crimes to his credit, including a few murders and robberies. At the outset the prison warden is releasing under instructions two prisoners, Joe Connors and Soapy Marks. Marks makes a rattling good speech, which is effective, but his asides, one thinks, would be apt to arouse suspicion, even if they were not understood. Inspector Hallick then shows his leather lungs by growling at the two convicts.After that the story is chiefly confined to the mystery house, which is rented by Dr. Redmayne (Alec B. Francis), who has an odd lot of people including a Mrs. Elvery, a strong believer in the occult, which is employed in an effort to make the story creepy.Mr. Horton contributes his talent to the rôle of Ferdinand Fane, who is not nearly so stupid as he at first looks. There are the conventional tricks, which hardly keep one from surmising what the surprise will be, but at the close there is quite a good minor idea, explaining how the guilty person was able to hoodwink others.Among the clever short Vitaphone subjects that preceded the feature was one with Albert Spalding, the violinist, and another in which Rosa Raisa and Giacomo Rimini are heard and seen rendering the duet from the fourth act of \\"Il Trovatore.\\" THE SCREEN; A Titleless Talking Film."},{"year":"1991","title":"Jordan joined Syria, Lebanon, Egypt and Saudi Arabia today in agreeing to attend a regional peace conference proposed by the United States. Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Israel, however, told the visiting American Secretary of State, James A. Baker 3d, that he wanted more time to consider the matter.   King Hussein said, \\"We are ready to attend a peace conference, and we are very happy indeed it is going to be a comprehensive one.\\" The Jordanian ruler spoke at a news conference with Mr. Baker after their talks in Amman, Jordan's capital.   Until now, Jordan has wavered on accepting the American proposal, waiting to see if Syria would.  5 Acceptances in His Pocket    Mr. Baker, armed with commitments from the five Arab countries to take part in a conference that would open the way for direct negotiations with Israel, flew here from Amman to try to persuade Mr. Shamir to drop his opposition to the proposed peace talks.   The Israeli Government, though, seemed shocked -- confronted by Mr. Baker after he obtained, over three days, commitments from the Arabs to take part in the conference and in subsequent direct talks.    Jordan also joined Saudi Arabia and Egypt in offering to suspend the Arab economic boycott of Israel if it will suspend the building of settlements in the occupied lands. And President Bush, on a visit to Turkey, again suggested that Israel halt settlement building on the West Bank.    The Israeli public appears skeptical about the latest round of American diplomacy, tempering hope with caution.  [ Page A6. ] Deadline or No Deadline    Mr. Baker denied that he had set a deadline for an Israeli response on peace talks, but American officials say it is possible that when President Bush and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev meet in Moscow on July 30 and 31, they will issue invitations to the conference -- as its joint sponsors -- whether the Israelis have responded positively or not. Such a move would put Israel under even greater pressure to attend.   \\"We have always indicated that that would be something we might pursue,\\" said Mr. Baker, when asked whether invitations would soon be sent. \\"Of course, it would be much better, if there is going to be a conference, if everybody could sign on before invitations are issued.\\"    Senior Israeli officials said they had no idea what Mr. Shamir was going to do, and the Israeli Prime Minister was saying nothing.    Mr. Shamir's dilemma, though, is clear. If he says yes to Mr. Baker, his fragile coalition Government is likely to collapse and he will be challenged by members of his own rightist Likud bloc. If he says no, he risks alienating Israel from the United States, and from much of the rest of the world.   Mr. Baker met with Mr. Shamir alone for 90 minutes. The meeting was taken up almost entirely with a review of the essence of the letter that President Hafez al-Assad of Syria sent to Mr. Bush a week ago. In that letter, the Syrian leader is said to have committed his Government to take part in the peace conference and subsequent direct talks.   The Israelis have been deeply suspicious that Washington and Damascus struck some sort of deal. American officials said that Mr. Baker, without actually showing Mr. Shamir the Assad letter, had briefed him both on its contents and on the side assurances that the United States had provided the Syrians. What U.S. Would Do for Syria    Those side assurances mostly involve restatements of American policy: that the United States does not recognize the Israeli annexation of the Golan Heights","excerpt":"that it believes that United Nations Security Council Resolution 242, calling on Israel to exchange land for peace, applies to the Golan Heights as well as to the West Bank, and that the United States is committed to pushing any peace negotiations actively, so as not to allow delays.    Mr. Shamir asked Mr. Baker for more time to consider the matter, and the two men will be meeting again on Monday. \\"We are not under any pressure to give an answer soon,\\" the Prime Minister's spokesman, Avi Pazner, said. \\"The problem is content, not deadlines.\\"   Before Mr. Baker met with Mr. Shamir, he held talks with three West Bank Palestinian leaders, led by Faisal al-Husseini, and made it clear to them that they, too, had to make some hard decisions. American officials said it was a tough, and at times emotional, encounter in which the Palestinians were essentially told that as the weakest party in the equation, they would have to accept previously unpalatable political realities.    One of those is that the Palestine Liberation Organization, led by Yasir Arafat, can have no direct involvement with their delegation to the peace conference, since that would prompt the Israelis to walk out immediately.    The other is that no Palestinians from East Jerusalem can take part in the first stage of the negotiations. The Israelis have ruled this out, arguing that such a role would imply that East Jerusalem, which Israel has annexed, was negotiable.    But it is possible that the second restriction might be finessed if there is a joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation and Palestinians born in Jerusalem take part with Jordanian passports.   Despite those restrictions, the Palestinian leaders were told that they would soon have to come up with a list of acceptable representatives, American officials said.    An intriguing thing about the endorsements that Mr. Baker has won from the Arab countries is that the Arab leaders all say in public that they are ready to accept Mr. Bush's proposal to attend \\"a peace conference\\" to reach a \\"comprehensive solution\\" based on Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338. But none of them ever mentions that this conference is intended as a ceremonial opening event for direct Arab-Israeli talks.   American officials insist that the Arab leaders have privately assured them that they understand this, but do not now want to say it publicly for fear of alienating their own hard-liners. Each one, instead, allows Mr. Baker to say it for him.   Thus, when reporters asked King Hussein today if he would say in public that he was committed to direct talks with Israel, he was not pleased.    Looking a bit flummoxed, the King replied, \\"This is about the most ridiculous question I have ever heard.\\"   If it is so simple, the reporters persisted, why not give just a simple answer?    \\"What do you attend a conference to do?\\" the King retorted. \\"To mime? To make faces at each other, or to discuss and try to resolve the problem? I have been calling for this for years and years. I assure you that this is really the intention, and it is very, very clear.\\"   As the journalists continued to press the King to say the words \\"direct bilateral talks with Israel,\\" he declared the news conference over and walked out with Mr. Baker.                    --------------------       BUSH REITERATES VIEW    ISTANBUL, Turkey, July 21 (Special to The New York Times) -- President Bush, on a visit to Turkey, suggested once again today that Israel should be flexible for the sake of peace in the Middle East and halt settlement building on the West Bank.    \\"The question of settlements has been important,\\" Mr. Bush said, in response to a reporter's question at a meeting here today with Turkish opposition leaders. \\"I haven't encountered anybody in this part of the world that thinks increasing settlements is a helpful thing. And the United States policy has been opposed to it for years.\\"    The President also said he did not want to use a \\"volatile\\" word like pressure in talking about his stance with the Israelis. He preferred to call it \\"reasoning and taking this -- what I keep calling a new credibility for the United States in the Middle East -- and using that to encourage what is a very reasonable and important step to peace.\\" JORDANIANS AGREE TO JOIN IN TALKS ON MIDEAST PEACE"},{"year":"1991","title":"No. It has taken me 80 years to learn this golden word.

The setting was easy to choose: the front steps of the Public Library at 42d and Fifth, where we met two years ago.   That morning I'd gone into the Grand Hyatt, held up a bottle of Champagne and begged the front desk manager to keep it on ice for my brother to pick up and present to us after I popped the question. The ring was hidden on a bed of cotton inside a plastic deli salad-dressing container.   After Erin said yes, the strangers around us applauded and offered congratulations. My brother appeared with the bubbly, which the hotel had iced, adorned with flowers and complemented with two champagne flutes. Then he took pictures of our toast and a first walk through a reborn Bryant Park as a betrothed couple.   The following evening in Central Park a runner passed by and waved. \\"I was sitting behind you yesterday when you got engaged,\\" she said. \\"Well done!\\"   I love New York in June, how about you? -- DON GEHAN                    . . .       FATHER'S DAY Like some stubble-faced King in his suburban court, I will rule this sunny Sunday with the pretense of paternal power. And my progeny, like royal subjects, will pretend that I am the regal ruler! Sermons from the college freshman on yuppie greed and the greenhouse effect will surcease    and her high school sister will abandon that earringed boyfriend and the loud late-night music. All until tomorrow when I will surrender my crooked crown and, dethroned but still loved, accept the reality that daughters, not dads, possess the family royal ancestry. -- ROGER GRANET                      . . .       Dear Diary:   Walking past the main post office in Manhattan on a recent Wednesday evening at about 6:30, I noticed that the parking meters along Eighth Avenue were decorated with Police Department placards proclaiming \\"No Parking Friday.\\" A series of orange cones had been placed in the street preventing motorists from parking at the curb.   As I turned the corner into 33d Street I saw a young woman in civilian clothes engaged in putting up additional signs. I asked her if it was not a bit premature to be posting \\"No Parking Friday\\" signs on Wednesday and already blocking the streets to prevent parking.   She replied that the prohibition would be taking effect at midnight that night. I suggested that it would then be only Thursday. \\"Well,\\" she replied airily, \\"we ran out of 'No Parking Thursday' signs.\\"   I inquired whether motorists who parked their cars adjacent to these signs on Thursday would be towed away. \\"Of course,\\" she said without batting an eye.   What a remarkable city. --RICHARD A. NACHMAN                    . . .           The scene:    British Airways plane heading to New York from Heathrow Airport.     Dramatis personae:    Two splendidly dressed women, both in their late 40's, both New Yorkers, and a third New Yorker who overhears their conversation.      Woman 1:    Did you have a great vacation?     Woman 2:    Well, it wasn't as terrific as I thought it would be. But that turned out to be the case with my marriage    and    my bridge club.                    . . .         Dear Diary:     After too long an absence I recently moved back to New York. The other afternoon -- sunny, breezy, lovely -- I took a stroll along Broadway. A woman fell into step beside me. \\"I love this weather,\\" she said. \\"It works against my hot flashes.\\"   I laughed, we started to talk, and I said I had just returned to Manhattan after 25 years in California. \\"Why?\\" she asked me, adding that she had been thinking of moving out there.   So I told her how much I had missed the interaction of New York","excerpt":"that Los Angeles had no sense of community; that San Francisco had proven to be a more surprising disappointment, the city being strangely without heart, like a beautiful woman who got by on looks alone.   I told her that for all New York's problems, I felt wonderfully warm returning here. We talked for several blocks until we reached my apartment building. I turned to say goodbye.   \\"I'm really glad you decided to come back,\\" she said.   Me, too. You could live in California for 25 years without that kind of spontaneous interchange. --GWEN DAVIS                    . . .       A friend writes:   Like most of my contemporaries I can't believe I'm really past the half-century mark. Surely we don't look 50-plus.   So there I was zipping down the West Side, tired after the long drive from upstate, eager to return the car to the garage. Too late I realized that I had slipped through a red light. Flashing lights appeared in the rear view mirror and an embarrassingly loud bullhorn commanded, \\"Make the turn and pull over to the curb.\\"   \\"Forty-first Street and 12th Avenue, the light was red when you went through,\\" the officer said. \\"Let's see your registration, insurance card and driver's license.\\" He looked at the photo on my license, then at me.    \\"I've been a cop for seven years and I've never done this before. But your papers are all up to date, you've got your seat belt on and, well, you remind me of my mom. So I'm not going to give you a summons. Now be more careful in the future.\\"   His mom, I'm certain, is a    most    attractive woman.                      . . .

In a few of these pictures the colors are as sumptuous as oils. One group of six panels forming a 3.8- by 4.4-   foot    print that records a siege of the port of La Rochelle, France, was made around 1630 by the great Jacques Callot, who could engrave myriads even on a tiny plate; it bristles with hundreds of vessels and thousands of land troops, each precisely depicted and quick with menace. A 17th-century Dutch engraving of 10 scenes on a single sheet records a whole war with England, including the treaty signing and the fireworks at the victory celebration.

Guggenheim Museum in Manhattan.    Behind the News -- The painting, ''Children With a Cart,'' was stolen while the driver stopped for a break. The museums said the painting would be ''virtually impossible to sell and therefore has no value on the open market.'' It was the area's second major art theft in a year. Last November, thieves broke into the Everhart Museum in Scranton and made off with an oil painting by Jackson Pollock worth $11.6 million and a $15,000 silkscreen by Andy Warhol. An F.B.I. spokeswoman said the incidents were not thought to be connected.    FOUND: A GENETIC ROADMAP    The News -- Scientists say they have found a way to reconstruct the genome of a Neanderthal man who lived 38,000 years ago, an effort that is expected to shed light on the genetic changes that have made humans human.    Behind the News -- Using two different methods, scientists were able to begin assembling the genome with DNA extracted from a thigh bone found in a cave in Croatia. They hope to map the entire genome over the next two years. From the data so far, scientists say that the Neanderthal and human genomes are at least 99.5 percent identical. It is in that last one-half of 1 percent that scientists hope to find the distinctive genetic attributes of modern humans, who displaced their Neanderthal relatives about 30,000 years ago.    LOST: A U.S. HOUSE RACE    The News -- More than a week after Election Day, United States Representative Rob Simmons, a Republican from Connecticut, conceded to Democrat Joe Courtney after a recount showed he had lost by just 91 of the 242,405 votes counted.    Behind the News -- Mr. Simmons's loss by three one-hundredths of 1 percent of the vote made this the closest race so far among the 435 House races, though recounts are still underway in several Congressional districts. Eastern Connecticut is no stranger to tight races. In 1994, the representative at the time, Sam Gejdenson, a Democrat, was re-elected by 21 votes, a margin of one one-hundredth of 1 percent. Then Mr. Simmons came along in 2000 and beat Mr. Gejdenson by about 2,800 votes. As for Mr. Courtney, colleagues are calling him ''Landslide Joe.''    FOUND: TRACES OF PLUTONIUM    The News -- International atomic inspectors reported that they found unexplained traces of plutonium, which can fuel atom bombs, on samples from containers from an Iranian nuclear waste storage facility.    Behind the News -- The discovery by the International Atomic Energy Agency renewed worries that Tehran might have a secret nuclear weapons program. Iran has made no secret of its efforts to enrich uranium to fuel nuclear reactors, and hopes to finish preliminary work goal this year. At greater purity, uranium can fuel atom bombs. But weapons designers prefer plutonium, which can be extracted from spent reactor fuel, because it takes less to produce a big explosion. Intelligence analysts say Iran could be three to nine years away from being able to build an atomic bomb.

Transposed by Sohuenzel onto the mobile silver screen, this tale of a most unheroic, aging Jupiter come down from Olymp accompanied by Mercury to the Spaa of Theben, has lost none of its time-honored effectiveness. There he takes on the shape of the handsome Amphitryon to philander with the absent warrior's wife, Alkmene. But the great Olympic deity is tripped up by his very human alcoholic weakness and returns frustrated and crushed to on high.While the picture is in many ways the comedy parallel to our \\"Cleopatra\\" film and faintly echoes Korda's still more distant \\"Fair Helen,\\" it has ventured a step further. For about half the dialogue is verse, spoken against a sound track of muffled but strongly rhythmic music — a trick which Schuenzel had already, but not so successfully, used in \\"Viktor and Viktoria.\\"Some six months ago the captivating announcement came that Walter Reisch was preparing a new film down in Vienna with Paula Wessely as its star","excerpt":"that not only was he to be credited for the manuscript, but, for the first time, was to stand on his own as director. From the German Talker's nursery days on, beginning with \\"Zwei Herzen\\" to last year's \\"Maskerade,\\" Reisch has contributed so many of its most effective scenarios that his name sufficed to assure a large measure of success to any picture.A few weeks ago the Reichsfllm-fachschaft, which holds all film forces in compulsory membership, gave out notice that Willy Zayn had been expelled from it because he had shadow-directed \\"Episode,\\" shielding the Jew, Walter Reisch. After several weeks of haggling whether manuscript, cast and director had been okayed by the Reichsfilmkammer before this Austrian picture went into the studio, Zayn was reinstated as an affirmation of these facts. The film, which had been held back, pased a glib censor and opened last night at the Ufa Gloria Palast. The program, being printed ahead of these variable times, mentioned neither Zayn nor Reisch, but the screen gives Reisch directing credit and lists Zayn as co-author.Perhaps so much pro-and-con preamble arouses too keen an eagerness At any rate, the picture falls short of this anticipation. Without critical selectiveness or discretion, it is cluttered with gags, old and new, bad and good, and those that are good lose through repetition.Its story of the young art student taking money from an elderly collector in return for platonic friendship so that she may support an unsuspecting mother, drips of human kindness. Cross currents swirl when the girl falls in love with another man and is suspected by him for what she is not. Her energetic clearing up of an ambiguous situation gives the final scenes a pleasant perkiness.

DURING the last several years, Americans, increasingly aware of the threat of nuclear annihilation, have been groping for a way out of the arcane world of Doctor Strangelove. In the elections last fall, antinuclear resolutions were adopted in 9 states, 12 counties and 22 cities. A resolution calling on President Reagan to negotiate a nuclear freeze with the Soviet Union was adopted by the House of Representatives this year. The nation's Roman Catholic bishops have issued a pastoral letter condemning nuclear arms. The Boston Globe won a Pulitzer Prize this year for a 56-page Sunday section about the nuclear issue. Two of the George Polk awards given to journalists by Long Island University in 1983 were for reports on nuclear war.

This region is defined roughly by central and northern Tunisia and extreme northeast Algeria - a rectangle about 300 miles from east to west and 150 miles from north to south.

It seemed to me that we had already had numerous films of this type which were far better photographed and infinitely better arranged and cut.The Byrd picture, of course, is in a class by itself and the enthusiasm for it is understandable. Paramount was sensible enough not to attempt to synchronize the sound shots with German dialogue. The whole picture is merely underlined by an effective orchestra accompaniment.As a contrast to these Ramon Navarro's and Harold Lloyd's first talkers were received with only a very small percentage of the enthusiasm awakened by their silents in the old days. Lloyd's dialogue was doubly hindering to the action because the humor practically never registered and because Lloyd's best moments were and always will remain his acrobatic ones. All the dialogue was extracted from the Napoleonic Navarro picture \\"The Youngest Lieutenant\\"—only the star songs being left in. Of course, the action seemed diaggy as always in such cases, and the elaborate mouth movements without the speech were annoying.And a peculiarly futile idea was the belated showing of Greta Garbo's last silent picture, \\"Wild Orchids.\\" For all that many of the critics here are crying for the return of the voiceless screen, they rushed from this picture uttering moans about the depth to which hokum can sink even with as gorgeous a being as the Garbo.Continental Opinions.DER DEUTSCHE, an enterprising German daily, conducts a yearly ballot of the best films of the year. Of course, the results have a certain German bias, but on the whole it is the most international, as leading personalities in America, France and England balance the Germans to a very fair extent. So the list has universal interest.The first ten films were:1. \\"Sous les toits de Paris\\" (French).2. \\"All Quiet on the Western Front.\\"3. \\"The Blue Angel.\\"4. \\"West Front, 1918 (German war film).5. \\"Anna Christie.\\"6. \\"Zwei Herzen im Drei Viertel Takt\\" (German operetta).7. \\"With Byrd at the South Pole.\\"8. \\"Brand in der Oper\\" (German).9. \\"The Big House.\\"10. \\"Micky Mouse.\\"I am sure you will be surprised at the position of Réné Clair's French picture, but its very Continental atmosphere and outlook evidently persuaded many Germans and French to vote for it. \\"All Quiet on the Western Front\\" was helped to its position as much by the English and German vote as by the American. \\"Micky Mouse\\" reflects the German and English enthusiasm for our animated comic strips.For the sake of completeness, here are also the next fifteen: (11) \\"Min and Bill,\\" (12) \\"Die letzte Kompagnie\\" (German), (13) \\"Hell's Angels,\\" (14) \\"Dreyfus\\" (German), (15) \\"Woman's Sorrow and Happiness\\" (Russian gynecological film), (16) \\"Earth\\" (Russian), (17) \\"Common Clay,\\" (18) \\"Sally,\\" (19) \\"The Jazz King,\\" (20) \\"The Great Gabbo,\\" (21) \\"Struggle for the Soil\\" (Russian), (22) \\"Flight,\\" (23) \\"Morocco,\\" (24) \\"Out-ward Bound,\\" (25) \\"Fathers and Sons\\" (Swedish).Many of the people questioned made stimulating comments. Here are a few samples:Bernard Shaw: \\"All owners of sound patents should be either drowned, shot, exiled to St. Helena or in some other effective way be kept away from the work in the studios. Not until a new race of artistic producers is discovered will artistic films be produced.\\"Galsworthy: \\"I do not believe that the talker will ever supplant the silent film. For certain effects can only be gotten by the silent film, which has its dramatic accent on the pictorial. These effects are negated as soon as the dialogue is used.\\"H. L. Mencken: \\"In 1930 I unfortunately only saw one film—'Hell's Angels.' I thought the fighting scenes were well made, but the love story was exceptionally banal and idiotic, and most of the acting was very poor.\\"It was interesting to note that the German director, Richard Oswald, voted for his own film, \\"Dreyfus\\"","excerpt":"that Réné Clair, the director of \\"Sous les toits de Paris,\\" voted for the German picture \\"West Front 1918\\"; that Cecil B. de Mille voted for \\"All Quiet on the Western Front\\" and \\"The Dawn Patrol\\"; that Jacques Feyder voted for \\"Min and Bill\\"; that Eisenstein voted for \\"Micky Mouse.\\"An Oppressive Work.THE higher the ambition of a film, the more depressing its failure. \\"Der Mann der den Mord beging\\" (\\"The Man Who Committed the Murder\\") is one of that sort. Its director, Kurt Bernhardt, is one of the most talented of the younger generation. His \\"Letzte Kompagnie,\\" which the Ufa brought out last year, had an exceptional quality. In his last production he was also trying to achieve something outside the ordinary run. And at least the film has proved that there is no development for the talker in the direction he chose.Here Bernhardt has laid the stress on atmosphere, not on characterization and plot. The action takes place in Constantinople and he has very skillfully created the mood of that city. Its strange buildings float by, the oppressive languor of its climate weighs down upon us. But it is a mood without vitality, hanging suspended in a glass globe. Not only the city is lifeless but the characters who walk through it are bloodless, a little spectral. All the oppressive little details of daily life which give it its depressing boredom are underlined; cigarettes are lit, tea is drunk, conventional conversations are interspersed with those embarrassed pauses which no one can find the right phrase to break. In short, the manner of the modern realist is set over into the field of the talker. The effect is excruciating. I have seldom attended a film more difficult to sit through. The screen demands action, action, action—at best atmosphere can only gild the statue.And the more's the pity for the waste of the fragile intensity of Trude von Molo, of the fine reserve of Conradt Veidt, of the surging power of Heinrich George. And this was the first talker scenario by Carl Mayer, who gave us \\"Caligari\\" and \\"The Last Man.\\" Has speech on the screen cut him off from us?John Boles and Rose Hobart have been picked for the leads in Universal's production of Arthur Somers Roche's new novel, \\"A Lady of Resource.\\" Mr. Boles is now completing his rôle in \\"Seed,\\" the Charles G.

Briefing reporters after one session on that topic, the United States Secretary of the Treasury, Donald T. Regan, said: ''There was quite an exchange among the Canadian Prime Minister, the British Prime Minister, the German Chancellor and the President of the United States. And the subject was unemployment, inflation and whether or not there is a trade-off.''   Although the seminar lacked a professor to interpret the results, the Secretary of the Treasury did his best.

Her transition to maturity was closely scrutinized, and when she proved to be an artist of substance, one heard fretting about whether the next crop of prodigies would send her into a tailspin.

Heralded as a searching investigation of the policy ring, the film dashes briskly from fact to near-fact and then plunges whole-heartedly into fiction. This does not diminish its value as melodrama, but it would be disappointing if you had entered the Capitol hoping to discover from Mr. Mooney what he had refused to tell the grand jury.When you come right down to it, the extent of Metro's sensational disclosures is that there is a policy ring which started in Harlem and was taken over by the big business men of crime","excerpt":"that shopkeepers have been intimidated by the racketeers, and that men occasionally were murdered for attempting to \\"muscle in\\" on another policy king's territory.These being matters of record, \\"Exclusive Story\\" recognizes its need for something really breath-taking and tries to provide it by suggesting that the Morro Castle disaster may be blamed on the policy racketeers. The argument is that, in order to eliminate a possible key witness against them, they hired him to convey a shipment of liquid fire to Cuba, planning to have him murdered there. In presenting this choice fantasy, Metro covers itself by calling the ship the Mochado, but there is no question about the one it had in mind.There are lesser romantic extravagances, chief among them being Franchot Tone's appearance as the Governor's special prosecutor detailed to wipe out the policy racket, the kidnapping of his fiancée as a method of forcing him to drop the investigation, and Madge Evans's participation in the G-men's raid on the kidnappers' hideout.Nor for this mélange of fact and fancy will Metro's photoplay be approved, but for its generosity in providing another major rôle for Joseph Calleia, who is rapidly becoming this department's favorite villain. Last week Mr. Calleia stole \\"Riffraff\\" from the great Jean Harlow; here, with less serious competition, it is not so much a matter of theft as of open expressage.As Ace Acello, the vicious lieutenant of the numbers king, Mr. Calleia contributes a performance that must be remembered when the time comes to take inventory of the year's best.

For something like 100 minutes, and it seems like more, this accusation is dinned into the audience's collective ear and impinged upon its eye. Aside from one's personal beliefs on the matter, the theme grows tiresome. One is tempted to stroll down the aisle and ask, with Broadway flippance, \\"So what?\\"That should not be the reaction to a film that presents war in all its horror","excerpt":"that shows men dying in agony, pierced by the bayonet, stricken down by machine gun bullets, blown to bits by shells, strangled by gas; that prays for peace, and asks why nations cannot learn their lesson from the last holocaust. It should not be the reaction, yet it is and it can be explained.Jacques Koerpel, one of the producers of \\"War Is a Racket,\\" offered his explanation in a curtain speech to the preview audience. It was that the film was not edited fully; that certain key scenes were omitted; that others, of less importance, would be within the next forty-eight hours. But Mr. Koerpel's explanation, although serving to excuse a certain dragginess about the film, does not meet this corner's objections to the picture.The objection, specifically, is that the film is editorial, rather than reportorial; it is propaganda and, as such, must depend for success on the strength of its argument. And, to this corner, the argument is not particularly strong. That war is cruel and probably unnecessary need not be argued. That it is a \\"racket\\" is not proved by the film, in spite of the repeated assertions to that effect by its narrator—in the guise of an inquiring reporter—and the persons he interviews, including the gold star mother, the former munitions maker, the economist, the minister and the business man. Their saying so does not make it so, and the film, itself, is not material evidence. Neither can this skeptic swallow entire the assertion that the munitions makers are the cause of wars; was not there some talk a decade back that prohibition would eliminate drinking?The Gaiety's picture, then, emerges as an anti-war film that lacks the photographic and narrative artistry of \\"The First World War,\\" as an almost unnecessary appeal for peace—although the day's news might indicate that such an appeal might not be amiss after all—and as a rather tiresome attempt to blame all martial ills upon the munition makers of the world. Yet, for all its blunders and technical deficiencies, it deserves encouragement for the spirit, if not the material, that it shows.

Yet even on the narrow bases Mr. Taylor would seem to allow, it is possible, I think, to demonstrate that the language of the poem cannot be Shakespeare's. 1. In the second stanza, the speaker says, ''Yet I must vent my lust,'' which in context means ''Yet I must express my love'' (see lines 11 and 20). ''Lust,'' in its various forms and compounds, occurs 95 times in Shakespeare's authentic work. Two or three times it means merely pleasure or delight, but overwhelmingly often it means at least inordinate desire or, more frequently, carnal appetite. It is never used, as here, simply as a synonym for ''love.'' 2. In the third stanza, the speaker tells himself that the lady's response ''Gives thee joy - or annoy, / or affliction.'' The syntax is odd here, for the speaker foresees not three but only two possibilities: good fortune (''joy'') or misfortune (in the form of either ''annoy [ ance ] '' or ''affliction'').

Since when has it been a textual principle that a poem must be regarded as belonging to an author until proved otherwise?

The quality of the poetry aside, I am far from convinced by the evidence presented, much less the rationale for adding the poem to the canon. Mr. Taylor's evidence includes the fact that the poem contains phrases Shakespeare used in his works and that it contains words he did not use in his works. The stylistic similarities fail to convince me when they consist of such common rhymes as ''die'' and ''lie'' or ''ever'' and ''never,'' as well as the re-use of phrases like ''naught but,'' ''so rare'' and '' 'tis a wonder'' - scarcely breathtakingly original poetic constructions.

Murnau, the German producer, unfolds in \\"4 Devils,\\" which was presented with dignity by William Fox last night at the Gaiety Theatre. This new pictorial effort from the director who gave to the screen \\"The Last Laugh,\\" \\"Sunrise\\" and other distinguished photoplays held the audience from the moment the face of a painted clown appeared to the final fade-out. It sent one away feeling that the characters were real, that the humor was natural and that the pathetic events occur in everyday life. And, not only are the players handled with unrivalled skill, but the photography is soft and seductive, calling attention subtly to the realism and art that pass in turn before the onlooker.From this sawdust story one gains the impression that Mr. Murnau exerts an amazing influence over his players, and where one might think he is digressing it soon turns out that he has something important to tell. He links his comedy expertly with the scenes that come before and after. He gives striking effects that are a part of the showman's life. There's nobody he neglects, and it might be said that he is just as assiduous in his guidance of the dressing room menial as he is of the principals. He has selected his cast so that they, so far as is possible, suit the characters. He depicts sympathy, cruelty, fear and courage in relatively few scenes, so that from the time the chronicle starts one is absorbed in the happenings and the actions of the characters.Without any prismatic effects this picture seems to make an impression of varied colors as it surges along. One senses that the cloaks of the \\"4 Devils,\\" acrobats par excellence, are scarlet","excerpt":"that the scowling circus manager in the initial scenes has a jaundiced complexion; that the siren is arrayed in gray and red; that the circus throngs lend gayety to the scenes by the diversity in hues of their clothing, and that the old clown's sad eyes and laughing mouth are streaked with rouge.It is, however, the unfaltering manner in which Mr. Murnau attacks his scenes that is responsible for this picture's greatness. One forgets the actors and thinks of the characters. It is not Janet Gaynor with whom one sympathizes, but with Marion, the dainty little creature who is called upon to be one of the \\"4 Devils.\\" And so one deplores the conduct of Charles and at the same time realizes that the Lady, played by Mary Duncan, is a most alluring woman.Sentiment, of course, is depicted in some of the scenes, but argue as you will, you may admit that in circus life there is a good deal of sentiment, especially when a little titian-haired girl falls deeply in love with a dark-haired, good looking young man. It is not unlikely that this ordinarily cheerful Marion should seek to celebrate Charles's birthday after the show in the usual way—with a cake and candles. It is only natural that her smile should fade from her expressive face and tears come to her eyes when Charles does not appear, as he had done with the \\"4 Devils\\" and the old clown night after night.Without any undue emphasis Mr. Murnau gives a graphic notion of the trapeze performer's life; practice in the morning, then luncheon. Doing his act in the afternoon, then dinner. Doing his act in the evening, then supper, and finally, a well-earned rest. And one feels that virtually at every performance and even during the rehealsals there is chance of an accident. But the acrobat must earn his bread and butter!While the acting of all in this simple but deftly told narrative is beyond reproach, it is perhaps the work of Mary Duncan, the stage actress who won great praise by her portrayal of Poppy in \\"The Shanghai Gesture,\\" that is the outstanding individual effort. As the temptress of Charles, incidentally impersonated by Charles Morton, she is quite fascinating, knowing how to use her brown eyes and yet doing so naturally, considering the character she portrays. She is supposed to be a gay lady of immense wealth and one who is heartless, especially when she encounters her show girl rival.In the early scenes Mr. Murnau deals with Cecchi's Circus, run by a brutal drunkard. Two boys, Charles and Adolf, are brought to Cecchi by an elderly woman, who tells the leering owner of the small circus that their father was an acrobat. She asks whether Cecchi can train them, for she is no longer able to care for them. Time passes from one stage to another until two little girls. Marion and Louise, then under the wing of the old clown, appear with Charles, and Adolf as the \\"Four Devils.\\" They prosper and soon perform in a circus in Paris. There are some compelling scenes depicting the exterior of the circus with the electric-light signs calling attention to the \\"Four Devils.\\" These acrobats go aloft in the circus, clad in velvet caps and cloaks. As they are hoisted up to their respective trapezes, the cloaks flutter to the sawdust below.The climax is Marion's fall. It happens on the night when the \\"4 Devils\\" do their act without a net. One rather wonders why they should go through this act without a net on the last night, but they do.Miss Gaynor's acting is effective. She portrays the little soul who loves Charles no matter what happens. Barry Norton is capital as the younger male acrobat. Nancy Drexel gives an excellent portrayal as the second girl acrobat. J. Farrell Macdonald, who made a hit in \\"The Iron Horse,\\" attracts much sympathy in his portrait of the old clown. But one could go through the whole list of players congratulating one after another, and they probably all know that they owe a great deal to that artist among directors, F. W. Murnau.

HarperCollins . $22.95.    Gail Sheehy promises much in \\"The Man Who Changed the World,\\" a biography of Mikhail S. Gorbachev that grew out of a portrait of the Soviet leader that Ms. Sheehy wrote for Vanity Fair magazine.   Taking off from the perception widely held in the Soviet Union that there are many sides to her subject's character, Ms. Sheehy subtitles her book \\"The Lives of Mikhail S. Gorbachev\\" and formulates a theory of his \\"incarnations\\" based on one of her previous books.   \\"The theory in my book 'Passages,' \\" she writes, \\"is that each of us develops throughout adulthood by stages. Between each stage are points of decision between progress and regression where we are challenged to shed a protective structure, and when we do we are left exposed and vulnerable, capable of stretching in ways we hadn't known before. For exceptional individuals, like Gorbachev, such passages assume the dimensions of deep personal transformations -- they become in some ways different people.\\"      She hints ominously about one of these sides of Mr. Gorbachev when in the third paragraph of her text she quotes a former senior Soviet analyst for the State Department who has studied Mr. Gorbachev for a decade: \\"I think he's capable of a great cruelty.\\"    But Ms. Sheehy delivers somewhat less than she promises. Her idea of cruelty is summed up in a remembrance by Andrei Brezhnev, who describes his grandfather, Leonid, taking pleasure in keeping pigeons and doves and hitting their cage to see them all fly around, terrified. This seems mild compared with Nikita S. Khrushchev's purported adolescent penchant for bashing cats' heads against stone walls, not to speak of Stalin's unspeakable sadism. As examples of Mr. Gorbachev's cruelty Ms. Sheehy offers us no detail. Nothing.   As for his multiple \\"lives,\\" she tells us little more than what is surely self-evident to any reader, namely that Mr. Gorbachev is mercurial, intuitive, adaptable, capable of walking a tightrope and turning on a dime, and no longer in control of the revolution he began.     It is too bad that Ms. Sheehy lets her readers down so, because despite all its huffing and puffing her book is enlightening in many ways. She never got to interview Mr. Gorbachev himself, but she did manage to visit his home village, Privolnoye, and to pick up a trail of his friends and associates that led from the girl next door right to the top of his Government command.   From these contacts she has learned much about Mr. Gorbachev's family background: that his ancestors were Cossacks who \\"had pushed down from the Ukraine and the Don area in search of virgin soil and religious freedom, settling in the southernmost wilds of the territory of Stavropol known as the Caucasus\\"","excerpt":"that the women in his family were strong and outspoken; that his maternal grandfather, the family patriarch during Mr. Gorbachev's childhood, was chairman of the local collective farm, or kolkhoz, which made him the most important person in the village; and that by contrast his paternal grandfather was arrested and deported to Archangel in 1937, purportedly for having hidden 40 pounds of grain for his family from the collective's harvest.     From this background Ms. Sheehy draws plausible enough conclusions: that the strong women around him in his childhood explains why Mr. Gorbachev concedes so much power to his wife, Raisa, who has even been his instructor at times and whom he regards as a full partner, referring to her as \\"my General.\\" And that the conflicting roles that his grandfathers played -- with one participating in Stalin's regime and the other becoming its victim -- account for the division in Mr. Gorbachev's character that allowed him to rise to the top of the ruling establishment and then to turn around and destroy it.   Unfortunately, she too often trivializes these perceptions with the style in which she presents them. Writing of Mr. Gorbachev's youth as if she were there present to observe it, she intones: \\"Driving the harvester every day, choking in the sworls of dust from the steppe, sweat streaming from his face, a continual trilling in his ears, he worked like a demon and waited for the Party to take notice.\\" Characters variously \\"gush,\\" \\"squeal\\" and \\"rhapsodize\\" where it would have perfectly adequately served for them simply to \\"say.\\" At one point, she describes Mr. Gorbachev as \\"a brilliant chameleon,\\" which seems an inapt way of saying what she is trying to convey, namely that Gorbachev is cleverly adaptable.     But the book's biggest shortcoming is its failure to dramatize Mr. Gorbachev's changes. Though she titles her various sections \\"First Gorbachev: Country Cossack 1931-1949,\\" \\"Second Gorbachev: First-Generation Apparatchik 1950-1977\\" and so forth through \\"Sixth Gorbachev: Red Star Falling Spring 1990,\\" she is only able to convey the startling contrast between Mr. Gorbachev as a genius on the world stage and Mr. Gorbachev as a failure at home.   What his problem finally comes down to, at least in Ms. Sheehy's view, is that despite the halting moves he has made toward a market economy, Mr. Gorbachev at heart still believes in socialism. As she quotes the image of a cabbage used by the writer Olas Adamovich: \\"Gorbachev believes that if he takes off the decayed leaves there will be a healthy cabbage inside. The apparatchiks know it's dangerous to strip off the leaves, because it's rotten inside, it will all have to be thrown away. Gorbachev is the last romantic socialist.\\"   The wonder of Ms. Sheehy's book is that it goes through such a complicated dance to make such a simple point.

STAGE: 'RABBONI,' ON JESUS AND SATAN"},{"year":"1922","title":"WHEN they realized how much was shown in their screen revival of periods of French and English history, the Germans decided to show the world an intimate little bit of their own historic past. Very conscious of its timely interest, I should say, they selected the life of Frederick the Great—that period when the foundation was laid for the work that Bismarck was to set the Crown to in 1871, and William II. to undo in 1914. So, playing on the sympathies and the antipathies of present-day Germany, the producers of this latest and most pretentious motion picture sat down and with unmistakable German crudition read book after book about the great statesman and warrior, filtered their contents through a rather Prussian, although on its surface unostentatious, idealism, manufactured about twenty-five reels of film destiny, and then called their product \\"Fridericus Rex.\\" The entire production is to be in four parts. Only two parts have been so far released, and these were shown together in Berlin on the same night before an audience as varied in its likes and dislikes as ever sat in a picture house.It is not the story of the birth of a nation that this picture tells, but the story of how a political idea was forcibly planted in a comparatively small group of people, who then, in their turn, after they themselves had completely assimilated it, were to enforce this idea on the whole of the German people. The authors and the producers of the picture want us to believe that their intentions were the best in the world","excerpt":"that their attitude was and is free from any political bias. However that may be, the picture remains a dangerous one—dangerous to the internal peace of Germany only, to be sure. For none but a German audience, fed and grown fat on a tradition of militarism and serfdom, could find anything admirable in the life and times of Frederick William.The first two parts, \\"Storm and Stress\\" and \\"Father and Son,\\" tell the story of Frederick's youth up to his coronation as King of Prussia upon his father's death. It really is this father, this most dogged and, to the Anglo-Saxon way of looking at things, most inhuman father, who is the centre of the play throughout this first part of the picture.The picture opens in Potsdam, to which little town we are introduced with a great expenditure of cleverly hidden sentimentality and reverence. We are allowed to see Frederick William as he really was—a limping, brutal old fellow, with perhaps in his own way a good heart, tyrannizing over his wife and children, expending all his energies in drilling his \\"big fellows\\" and in founding the world-famous Prussian militarism. He is shown to indulge in the gentle pastime of hitting in the face with his cane every one who calls forth his wrath, justly or not. The good gentleman has also his democratic attributes. His evenings he spends in the company of his officers, drinking ale and smoking a strong pipe, and the only thing to distinguish these royal entertainments from any tavern affair of the time is the total absence of wit. There are endless scenes showing these crude gatherings, where famous Generals and royal attendants perform the most absurd antics, and one asks one's self whether the wild applause with which they are accepted by the audience does not originate in some subconscious feeling of relief, and also in the secret joy of the subaltern given on opportunity to see his former master in a ridiculous situation.Endless are the drilling scenes, the parades, the military reviews. Berlin spectators still accept everything of this sort as genuine, and it certainly is not a very convincing proof of the alleged new democratic spirit of Germany when every tiny incident reminiscent of Potsdam autocracy and brutality is tumultuously applauded.There is another little benevolent trait of Frederick William's that deserves to be mentioned, firstly because it shows that the tactics of the Hohenzollerns were always the same, and secondly because its inclusion in the picture seems to be the result of what its makers intend to give relief.It was the habit of the old King simply to claim for his army any man who was unlucky enough to have reached a certain specified height and who otherwise also satisfied his Majesty's prerequisites. One such fellow, a pathetically shy pastor, has just been favored by the King's interest in him, and his wife, in her despair, forces her way past the sentinels and reclaims her revered husband. Frederick William releases the man because she promises to take care of the population of the Fatherland in a decidedly generous manner. His heart is not moved: he does not act under the pressure of a human emotion; his decision to release the man is a strategical move.In spite of the pompous title \\"Fridericus Rex,\\" and the intention to tell the story of Frederick the Great, the real protagonist of these two parts is Frederick William and the real plot the conflict between the King and the Crown Prince, between father and son.Fritz is shown in his prison, and great emphasis is put upon the fact that a Hohenzollern Prince, in strict accordance with discipline and in still stricter obeyance to the principle of equality before the law, is forced to spend his days in a jail, recalling a calaboose in some small frontier town of our own West. Attempts at humor are not missing—at that hard, unnatural humor that so well mirrors the spiritual blankness of a martial period. So, for instance, when the candle in the Prince's cell is put out because it is the King's order that all lights be put out at 8 o'clock, the Prince answers with an intentionally smart gesture: \\"The King has not mentioned that it may not be lit again after 8 o'clock.\\"After a number of more or less historic episodes the Prince marries in accordance with his father's wish, and with his young, indifferent wife moves to Rheinsberg, where, according to the picture, he spends his time in arranging dancing parties, playing the flute, drilling soldiers and waiting for his father to die. When that day comes Fritz hurries to Potsdam. The coronation is celebrated. He steps out upon the balcony and shows himself to the cheering crowd. \\"Le roi est mort, vive le roi!\\" Fritz thus become Fridericus Rex.Some of the nationalistic and monarchically inclined papers hall \\"Fridericus Rex\\" as a picture of great educational value, a fact of which the makers are very proud. And educational value it certainly has. It depends, of course, entirely upon one's point of view, not so much on individual as rather a racial one, whether one finds the message it subtly conveys and the lesson it would teach recommendable or not.I am told that in its complete and ultimate shape the picture carries a pacifistic message.It is quite plausible that it be so, for there lived few men less free than this \\"King of battles\\" and rarely was a man temperamentally more unsuited to a life of warfare and political leadership than Frederick the Great. Had it not been for his disappointed youth and for the firmness with which the idea of the Prussian State was already planted in the young Crown Prince and the Generals, who knows but he would have put crown and sword into the hands of another?The Germans are very proud of the friendship between their warrior King and Voltaire, and to satisfy this rather just pride the French philosopher is brought into the picture to illustrate another side of Frederick, who really never could speak German well and who hated the language.The end itself, which is to carry the redeeming word to the world, is somewhat complicated and seemingly not quite clear in the minds of the makers yet. It is probable, however, that Napoleon will have to play a part in it, not unlike a deus ex machina, standing at the grave of Frederick and commenting upon the immortality and, equally, the cruelty and senselessness of all wars.The imminent danger in showing such a picture today lies, of course, in the reckless exploitation of the patriotic prejudices of the man in the street by monarchical and Junker elements. One radical paper even claims that the German National People's Party has its own hired claquers, who sit through every performance of \\"Fredericus Rex\\" and animate the rest of the spectators by clapping and shouting \\"Hoch!\\" How much truth there is to this I cannot tell, but the fact remains that the picture is used to stir up passions that were just about to settle down.Strange as it may seem, the makers of \\"Fridericus Rex\\" count on a great and hearty reception of their picture in the United States. It is even mysteriously ???ored that some American capital has been invested in its making. I am told that to establish a closer contact between German and American psychology, to span the gap that they modestly admit exists between a Prussian and a democratic interpretation of life, and also to give the picture a different, mote individual note, appealing particularly to Americans, some additional \\"shots\\" have been taken, not shown in the German version, and meant to introduce Frederick the Great's life to American audiences. These \\"shots\\" show George Washington, with Count von Steuben riding up and telling him that Frederick II. of Prussia is the first European monarch to recognize the independence of America. Washington shows surprise and admiration and inquires about the King, whereupon von Steuben tells the story that follows.German propaganda? you will ask yourself. If it be that, it is bad German propaganda and very much miscalculated. For what American will be able to look at \\"Fridericus Rex\\" without finding Frederick William's discipline uselessly cruel and savage; his attitude toward his son inhuman; his treatment of the women about him, manikins though they he, indecent and an insult to womanhood in general? And his passion for seeing a handful of men parade before him, together with the silly attempt at pomp, other than petty and absurd?Perhaps \\"Fridericus Rex\\" is destined to be the sepulchre of Prussian militarism, snobbishness and cruelty. Let us hope that to its German spectators it will carry the spirit that its producers say they have been guided by in its making.

Illustrated. 258 pp. New York: Basic Books. $18.95.   BIOLOGY has frequently been invoked to sanction social inequalities, not least those associated with sex. A century ago, measures of head size and speculations about physiology were deployed to make the case that women were intellectually incapable of higher learning and physically unable to tolerate the strain of it. While these fallacies have long since been discredited, the invocations they represent remain alive, finding expression nowadays in the language of psychology, split-brain theory, endocrinology, genetics and sociobiology. Various scientists would have it that the structure of women's brains renders them, on average, less adept than men at spatial relations and mathematics","excerpt":"that they are victimized by their hormones into moodiness, passivity and volatility under stress; and that they have been fated by evolution to play social roles subordinate to those of men.

In exposing a young couple's sudden tragedy and their ensuing, numbing grief, Mrs. Trintignant may not have entirely avoided the sudsiness of soap opera but she has largely succeeded in artistically dissecting a frightening subject with genuine understanding.This is not coincidental. A child of Mrs. Trintignant and her actor-husband, Jean-Louis, actually died suddenly when he was filming \\"Z\\" several years ago. The drama of \\"It Only Happens to Others\\" was, therefore, generated by horrible truth and it is as real as macabre fact, even if its emotional effects are only occasionally powerful.Mrs. Trintignant's often oblique approach—vignettes of a remembered past inter-cut with the stark present—diffuses matters. Despite the English subtitles, one wonders at the introductory scene, which shows an unshaven Marcello Mastroianni and a vaguely distraught but beautiful Catherine Deneuve distractedly making small talk and love in a strange, plush apartment. Only in disjointed subsequent scenes is it revealed that this is something of an anticlimax","excerpt":"that they aren't weird lovers; that they had been a happy, well-to-do husband and wife whose infant daughter's quick, unexpected passing has left them listless toward life, family and friends.But Mrs. Trintignant does capture precise, perceptive moments of mood and nuance. Sudden death in a hospital emergency room is made truly incomprehensible and shocking as they inarticulately grope for reasons and comfort. And vignettes of their child, alive and playful intrude with poignant effect to enhance their despair, despite the solicitude of family and friends.In their abrupt escape from urban self-imprisonment to recapture the life they once had, the director also has fashioned several sequences of quiet, sylvan beauty. Flocks of sheep, a provincial wedding and country children are striking in the film's pastel colors and also seem to indicate poetically a final release from the couple's grief.Since Mr. Mastroianni and Miss Deneuve are almost constantly before the camera, they may leave the impression of being involved in a marathon Actors Studio exercise. But they are thorough professionals who project obvious sincerity and feeling into really demanding roles. They're abetted by natural, if brief performances by a small supporting cast.As a distaff director and therefore a rare type, Mrs. Trintignant proves to be the film's top professional and an excellent vote-getter for Women's Lib.

Jury research is a fast-growing application of the psychosocial sciences. Its practitioners - a few dozen sociologists, psychologists, market researchers and others - use public-opinion surveys, in-depth interviews, computer analyses correlating jurors' backgrounds and attitudes and laboratory simulations of impending trials to help lawyers select jurors likely to favor their side, exclude those likely to be hostile to it and present their cases in ways psychologically designed to benefit from the unconscious needs and motives of the jurors.

Anastasius Gutierrez's advocacy of sainthood, the Catholic Encyclopedia devotes only one paragraph to her.   What happened in Isabella's time to the Jews and Moors of Spain and the annihilation of the American Indian have been fairly well chronicled, but some interesting facts are not too well known.   When King Ferdinand expelled the Jews for the \\"honor and glory of God,\\" he was fully aware of the wealth they left behind. A royal order of Nov. 23, 1492, confiscated all property and assets that had belonged to Jews, though they might now be in the hands of Christians. These funds paid for the 17 ships that made the second voyage of Columbus.   Isabella requested the introduction of the Inquisition into Spain, but only if the crown were allowed to keep all the property of the condemned. In 1478, Pope Sixtus IV agreed, allowing the Inquisition to retain only expenses. Yet in 1482, he issued a bull in which he complained that the Inquisitors were showing more lust for gold than zeal for religion","excerpt":"that they had imprisoned, tortured and burned faithful Christians on the dubious evidence of enemies or slaves. This institution became a major source of revenue to Isabella and her descendants.   Before Isabella, Spanish society was at least as advanced as the rest of Europe, but the forces she set in motion soon made Spain and Spanish America rank among the most backward nations in the Western world. The blame for much of the anguish of the Spanish-speaking world today can be at least partly attributed to Isabella and her progeny.

Now two came out the same week: Metro-Goldwyn's \\"Olympia,\\" at the Gloria Palast, and Warner Brothers' \\"Those Who Dance,\\" at the Capitol. Unfortunately, there was not much to cheer about.Particularly depressing was Molnar's \\"Olympia.\\" One hardly knows where to begin in criticizing this version—it was so completely wrong. I understand that a film from the same play, with John Gilbert, was already a frost in English, so why make a German version of it? Despite Molnar's tremendous popularity, the comedy had only a very lukewarm reception on the German stage. It was the thinnest of the thin, just barely kept alive by an occasional witty line and some astute plot quirks. Its story concerns an Austrian princess who is having a little flirtation with a cavalry captain. When her mother orders her to put an end to the affair, as scandal may ensue, she does so rather brusquely to conceal her feeling for him. He is deeply wounded and, in revenge, arranges to have himself accused of being a common swindler. Unless Olympia agrees to accede to his love, he threatens to publish his correspondence with her. She gives in, half against her will and half fascinated by the romantic glamour of the man. Next day he discloses his ruse and tells her that he has merely paid her back in her own coin. Scores are even.But the scenario writer, totally misunderstanding sentiment in modern Germany, added a sloppy scene in which the officer leaves the princess with tears in his eyes because he realizes that she is above him and he would be only her plaything. Also, the author wrote in an excessively banal seduction scene in which the words \\"I love you\\" were used again and again, each time to the accompaniment of louder titters from the audience. Has it not yet trickled through to Hollywood that in the talkies love and seduction scenes of such conventional calibre are quite impossible","excerpt":"that they tend only to excite the risibilities? Here is the place to say it with actions, not with words.An Uninspired Work.The direction of Jacques Feyder is also almost completely negative. He has given us merely a stage play; not anything even vaguely suggesting a film—just photographed theatre. Moreover, he seems to have been able to get very little out of his German players. Only Nora Gregor as Olympia comes through with a few effective moments, which promise much for her future as an emotional actress. But Theo Shall, as the officer, is too stiff and artificial. Julie Serda, as Olympia's mother, does not get more than a very small percentage of the comedy out of her rôle. Two splendid comedians, Arnold Korff and Karl Ettlinger, are completely miscast.The second German Hollywood version, \\"Those Who Dance\\" (Der Tanz geht weiter), is considerably better. Its story is conventional and it occasionally drags, but it is a workmanlike job. And how beautifully the sound came out at the Capitol on the Tobis reproducing equipment! The film will not create any dent in the German consciousness, but it will go the rounds without meeting any opposition.It is just the usual underworld thing about the noble policeman whose brother, also a copper, has been shot on duty. A boy has been accused of the crime, but it is the leader of a gang who is the real culprit. With the aid of the boy's sister, the policeman tracks down the crook, and, of course, there is the usual clinch at the final fade-out. But Anton Pointner, as the gangster, is really splendid, his brutality nicely seasoned with comedy. Lissi Arna does very kindly by the sister; and the star and director, Wilhelm Dieterle, is 100 per cent German manhood—just the way they like that sort of thing here.I am told that the making of these foreign versions in Hollywood costs anywhere from $80,000 to $125,000—surely neither of these pictures will get back the money invested in them. So it is still an open question whether it is worth while trundling a complete German cast across an ocean and a continent to make a film among the hills of Hollywood.Legal Tangles.FIVE HUNDRED theatre owners are on the lookout for a nice, high cliff. For 500 theatre owners are liable not only to find themselves without equipment for presenting talkers, but also to be sued for damages by Klangfilm, the German sound patent-holders. So a nice steep little cliff to jump off will come in ever so handy.It was like this: Klangfilm asked a high price for their reproducing equipment for talkers, and many of the smaller German theatre managers were unable to get together the necessary advances. But there was a loophole in the patent armor. Anybody could build loud-speakers and connect them with the projector; the kink was that they could not use the radio amplifying tubes which made the sound loud enough to fill a theatre. But the Lorenz Manufacturing Company had acquired a license from Klangfilm whereby they were allowed to manufacture these tubes. So they turned out a theatre equipment which was satisfactory and yet cost only approximately a half of that asked by the Klangfilm. And those 500 theatre owners went for it.And then came the courts. I will not go into all their folderol, for there is nothing in the world more depressing than legal German—unless, perhaps, it is legal English. The lower court judge sent down the decision that Lorenz was justified. But the Court of Appeals last week decided that Klangfilm had the right on their side. I believe there is a third court, whatever it calls itself, and I suppose it will finally settle things—if somebody does not start the case all over again from another angle. But the important thing is that Klangfilm now has the right to get out an injunction whereby all Lorenz equipped theatres will be forced to immediately remove their talker reproducing apparatus. Whether Klangfilm will do this before the final decision is doubtful, as, should they lose on the final decision, they would have to pay for putting all the equipment back again, and, further, they would knock quite lopsided the German market which they are supplying with talkers.Silent vs. Sound.WHEN the talker first came out here, it looked like a veritable mint. But a reaction soon set in. After the tremendous successes of \\"Atlantic,\\" the du Pont Titanic tragedy; Mady Christians in \\"Dich hab ich gellebt,\\" and Gustav Froelich's \\"The Night Is Ours,\\" attendance shifted back to normal. And now the theatre owners are complaining bitterly about the extra expenses they have to shoulder.The Henschel concern in Hamburg, which controls theatres seating over 10,000 people, issued the statement that only seven talkers did real good to their box office. These were: \\"Westfront 1918,\\" a war subject; \\"The Greifer,\\" a detective thriller; \\"Dreyfus,\\" a treatment of the historical case; and the \\"Love Waltz,\\" an operetta—all these because they were the first of their type. \\"Sous les toits de Paris\\" appealed despite its French dialogue because the characters were real human beings and all new faces. The Tauber talkers drew because the public seldom has a chance to hear Richard Tauber, their favorite tenor, on the stage. And finally \\"The Blue Angel,\\" with Emil Jannings and Marlene Dietrich, which Sternberg directed, had the appeal of its stars. Otherwise attendance was often below that of silent days.

The brothers introduced a method that they have continued to develop ever since and that is well documented in the book: negatives are scored and pockmarked, prints are stained with various off-color washes and the traditionally inviolate print is torn, cut up and reassembled with adhesive tape. The Starns also reinserted emotionally loaded subject matter into art -- Christ figures, historical martyrs such as Anne Frank and Martin Luther King Jr. -- rejecting post-modernism's ironic distance. Their work struck a chord with many, while others dismissed it as sentimental and reactionary.

Janet Malcolm, the journalist whose profile of the psychoanalyst, Jeffrey Masson, led to a libel suit that went to the United States Supreme Court and was the subject of two trials in Federal District Court, has asserted that a missing collection of notes of her conversations with Mr. Masson has been found at long last.   It is not clear what effect, if any, the new material will have on the case, in part because the fresh notes -- assuming they are genuine -- do not directly address the points on which Ms. Malcolm seemed most vulnerable. But her lawyer said yesterday that the material would be helpful if there was yet another trial.   In November, a jury in San Francisco essentially ruled in favor of Ms. Malcolm. It found that while two of five disputed quotations she attributed to Mr. Masson in a 1983 article in The New Yorker were false and one was defamatory, none were written with the recklessness that constitutes libel.   In a telephone interview yesterday from his home in Berkeley, Calif., Mr. Masson scoffed at the notion that missing notes had been uncovered. The psychoanalyst, who is appealing the verdict, called them \\"a fabrication, an adult version of 'the dog ate my homework.' \\"    But Ms. Malcolm has declared in an affidavit under penalty of perjury that the notes are genuine, and that her account of their discovery, first reported by Anthony Lewis, a New York Times columnist, on the Op-Ed Page of The Times on Friday, is true.    The notes were found, Ms. Malcolm said in the affidavit, by her 2-year-old granddaughter, Sophy Tuck, on the night of Aug. 11 in Ms. Malcolm's home in Sheffield, Mass. In Ms. Malcolm's telling, the child had been banging on the piano, then began exploring a nearby bookcase, where she plucked out a thin book with a red cover.   \\"I leafed through the book and saw it was a notebook filled with my own handwriting,\\" Ms. Malcolm said. \\"I began to read, and immediately saw that I had found the handwritten notes from which I derived the typewritten pages that are part of the trial record. . . .\\"   At issue in the marathon case, which has fanned a dispute over how much license -- if any -- a journalist should take with quotations, was Ms. Malcolm's portrayal of Mr. Masson in 1983. He had recently been dismissed as projects director of the Sigmund Freud Archives in London for criticizing Freud's theories of sexual abuse in childhood. A central question was whether quotations she attributed to Mr. Masson had been fabricated, as he contended, or simply rearranged and compressed.   In three of the five disputed quotations in the two-part, 45,500-word article, Ms. Malcolm wrote that Mr. Masson had said he hoped to turn Freud's home into \\"a place of sex, women, fun\\"","excerpt":"that two prominent psychiatrists considered him \\"an intellectual gigolo,\\" and that he himself would one day be considered the \\"greatest analyst who ever lived.\\"   A fourth disputed quotation concerned a paper in which Mr. Masson faulted psychoanalysis for its sterility. \\"I don't know why I put it in,\\" Mr. Masson is supposed to have said, conceding to Ms. Malcolm that his fault-finding was gratuitous.    The fifth disputed quotation concerned Mr. Masson's dismissal from the Freud Archives. Ms. Malcolm wrote that Mr. Masson had told her how an archives official asked him to keep quiet about losing his job, and that he had refused. \\"Well, he had the wrong man,\\" Mr. Masson is supposed to have told Ms. Malcolm.   The jury in the trial that ended in November found the fourth quotation false and the fifth not only false but also defamatory -- though not libelously so.    The notes that Ms. Malcolm said her granddaughter had turned up are of recollections about the first three disputed quotations and do not address the fourth and fifth.   Recalling the moment of discovery, Ms. Malcolm said: \\"I went into the kitchen, where my husband was finishing the dishes, and said, 'Gardner, I have found the notes.' They are in this little red book. . . .I theorized that Sophy had pulled the notebook out of the bookcase, where it had been sitting all these years, perhaps attracted by its bright red color.\\"   Ms. Malcolm had tape recordings to back up much of her quoted material, although she was criticized by some journalists for depicting a long-running luncheon conversation instead of the several interviews that actually took place. Ms. Malcolm said she had no notes to support the fourth quotation and had relied on memory. As for the fifth quotation, the issue was her editing of Mr. Masson's tape-recorded comments. Until the apparent discovery of the new notes, she had only typewritten summaries to back up the three other disputed quotations.   Mr. Masson insisted that the new notes were fake: \\"She did not take notes. I still maintain that.\\"   Ms. Malcom's lawyers originally moved to have the suit dismissed before trial, but the Supreme Court refused, holding that there were grounds for a trial. In the first, in 1993, a jury concluded that Ms. Malcolm had fabricated the five disputed quotations, but it deadlocked on damages. Some jurors thought Mr. Masson should get $1 million, while others thought that he had damaged himself by his own boasting.   Ms. Malcolm's lawyer, Gary L.

Mr. Doran, who inherited the job amid financial troubles, labor disputes and delays in opening its restored theater, is leaving by mutual agreement with the company and will remain a consultant for the rest of the season, according to a statement. The Guardian of London, though, reported that the news came as a shock to the company. Mr. Doran, an Irishman who had been recruited from the Perth International Arts Festival in Australia, came under fire earlier this year when he announced that productions by the company, which was founded in 1931 to present opera in English, would be accompanied by supertitles. In a statement, Mr. Doran said: ''While I am sad to be leaving, I am proud of what I have achieved. I took on this role with a number of big challenges for change that would secure the future of the organization and these have been met.'' In late 2003, after Mr. Doran joined the company, it was rescued from bankruptcy with a $15 million grant from a government arts agency, and Mr. Doran also oversaw the company's return to its theater, the Coliseum, after a four-year, $76 million renovation. With his departure, Loretta Tomasi, the executive director, becomes chief executive, and John Berry, the director of opera programming, becomes artistic director.

''The Road and the Radio'' (BNA) by Kenny Chesney sold 300,000 copies, a weekly increase of 58 percent, and climbed one spot to No. 2. The 20th volume of the pop compilation series ''Now That's What I Call Music!'' was a close third with 290,000 sales, up 70 percent, and Madonna's ''Confessions on a Dance Floor'' (Warner Brothers), last week's chart-topper, was at No. 4 with 210,000.

Wilson Plays Back On       In early November, a month after the playwright August Wilson, below, died, the Signature Theater Company announced that it had canceled plans to stage several Wilson plays in its 2006-7 season at the request of his estate. Yesterday the company said that decision had been reversed after further discussions, and next season the Signature will present three plays from Wilson's 10-part cycle, ''Seven Guitars,'' ''Two Trains Running'' and ''King Hedley II,'' at its Off Broadway theater on West 42nd Street. Mr. Wilson, who won two Pulitzer Prizes for drama, died of cancer on Oct. 2.  David Wilmot and Kerry Condon, who were in the world premiere of Martin McDonagh's ''Lieutenant of Inishmore'' with the Royal Shakespeare Company in Stratford, England, will lead the American premiere at the Atlantic Theater Company. The play, about an Irish terrorist with no sympathy for anyone but his cat, will be directed by Wilson Milam and also feature Brian d'Arcy James, Jeff Binder, Andrew Connolly, Dashiell Eaves, Peter Gerety and Domhnall Gleeson. Previews begin Feb. 8 at the Atlantic's theater on West 20th Street.

The circumstances of men in battle - gratuitous violence, ambivalence, frustration and anger, divided loyalties - are all to be found in Rob Riggan's first novel, ''Free Fire Zone.'' They are handled remarkably well once Mr. Riggan gets a hold on his material. The characters are medics at an evacuation site, or free fire zone, in Vietnam, caught between the war itself and the hospitals several hours away. It's hard to think what would be worse - being on the battlefront or within the medical unit, mopping up the gore. On a visceral level, this novel horrifies, though not simply because of the blood and guts. As the story progresses, it moves away from the medics themselves to the effect of our presence upon individual Vietnamese. In one of the many powerful scenes in the second half of the novel, the pregnant Vietnamese wife of one of the medics comes to the evacuation unit to claim the body of her husband, only to learn that it has been shipped to America to his ''family.'' Back in the States, Jon O'Neill, the narrator, reflects upon all these events as he sleeps next to a girl he has picked up for the night. He realizes that his inability to feel for anyone or anything is an extension of his drugged-out state during the war.

Behind the News -- Christened Cyber Monday by retailers, it's the day consumers return to work following the long weekend and log on to their office computers to do a little holiday shopping. Consumers spent $608 million, excluding travel, comScore estimates, up from $484 million on the same day last year. The spending was fueled by promotions and the migration of shoppers to the Internet. Retailers said they expected online holiday sales to increase by about 20 percent this year. But expectations are less cheery when brick-and-mortar stores are included. The National Retail Federation predicts a 5 percent rise in sales over all, below last year's 6.1 percent increase.    CHARLIE BROWN, BACK AGAIN    The News -- About 13 million viewers tuned into ABC on Tuesday to watch the 41st annual telecast of ''A Charlie Brown Christmas,'' in which Charlie and Linus search for the true meaning of the holiday, ''a big commercial racket'' in Lucy's opinion.    Behind the News -- About 15.4 million viewers watched the show when it first went on the air in 1965, making it the second-most-watched show that week, behind ''Bonanza.'' The 30-minute program with its piano-driven jazz score has had remarkable staying power. Although CBS's ''NCIS'' won the 8 p.m. time slot, ''A Charlie Brown Christmas'' outperformed it among adults 18 to 49. Lee Mendelson, 73, the executive producer, said the show's success goes back to Charles Schulz, the creator of the Peanuts cartoon strip. ''Someone once said he was a bell-ringer, and in a sense this was the ultimate bell-ringing: Hey, what's Christmas all about?''    THE CLASH OF VIDEO GAMES    The News -- In the latest holiday video game war, Nintendo sold 600,000 units of its new Wii game in its first eight days on the market, while sales of Sony's new PlayStation 3 appeared to be hurt by production problems that limited its availability.    Behind the News -- The holidays are crucial to the $30 billion worldwide video game industry. In the United States, roughly half of the industry's sales take place then. But short-term sales totals don't necessarily predict long-term success. Every Wii and PlayStation 3 that reaches a store will sell this month. But due to limits on availability, says Evan Wilson, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities, ''we can't gauge demand","excerpt":"that will become clearer next year.'' Meanwhile, the biggest winner this season may be Microsoft's Xbox 360, released last year, which targets the same hardcore gamers as Sony's new PlayStation, and is in stores.    A WINTRY BLAST    The News -- The first major snow and ice storm of the season swept across the central United States, closing schools, businesses and highways, creating chaos for air travelers and leaving hundreds of thousand of people without power.    Behind the News -- An arctic front pushing across the nation's center collided with warm moist air surging north from the Gulf of Mexico, creating freezing rain, sleet and snow across the Southern Plains, the mid-Mississippi River Valley and the central Midwest. In Kansas, the governor declared 27 counties disaster areas. Parts of Missouri were hit with more than a foot of snow, shutting down Interstate 70. Hundreds of flights were canceled at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport. What about Christmas? Too soon to say. ''December is kind of a wild card,'' says Michael Halpert, head of forecast operations at the National Weather Service's Climate Prediction Center.    HOLIDAY PINK SLIPS    The News -- Pfizer, the world's largest drug company, announced that it would lay off almost 2,400 sales representatives and managers, a 20 percent reduction in its sales force, which could lead to broader retrenchment in the industry.    Behind the News -- What would the holidays be without fourth-quarter layoffs and buyouts? Analysts said the decision by Pfizer, which had led the industry's sales force expansion, could induce other drug makers to cut back. The day Pfizer alerted its sales force of the layoffs, the Ford Motor Company said that nearly half of its hourly production workers -- some 38,000 -- had accepted buyouts and early retirement. There was also an unexpectedly large increase in the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits, rising by 34,000 to 357,000 -- the highest level since October 2005, in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.

An effective means of making fiction look like fact was photography, already a medium that had been used by avant-garde artists for their own aesthetic purposes. Now it was being manipulated to serve the government's as well. There were plenty of talented photographers to call on, among them the great Aleksandr Rodchenko. This show of more than 30 Soviet propaganda photographs, mostly from the 1930's, gives a good account of how photographic subjects were stage-managed by lensmen themselves, or adjusted later, by retouching, montaging, overpainting and airbrushing, all in the cause of glorifying the Soviet enterprise. The well-selected, heroic-looking soldiers of ''An Oath, Red Square, Moscow'' (1936), above, by Rodchenko, are tightly ranked under a banner proclaiming ''Workers of the World Unite!'' Arkady Shaiket's heroic image of a parachutist, Katya Melnikov (1934), in the cockpit of her plane glamorizes the new Soviet Woman. Smiling workers! Stalwart soldiers! Devoted families!

Griffith's Civil War epic would have been named best picture. This is a landmark in film history, with one cinematic innovation after another, marred by the Kentucky-born Griffith's extreme sympathy with the South and Southern attitudes of the time. Reconstruction-era black legislators are portrayed as uncouth, barefoot drunks. A subtitle refers to a mob of ''crazed Negroes.'' And the Ku Klux Klan is glorified in no uncertain terms as the savior of postwar civilization. The story focuses on two families, one on each side of the conflict. The 22-year-old Lillian Gish plays the young beauty in the Northern family. It was her 46th film. (Above: Joseph Henabery as Lincoln, signing a pardon for a soldier at the request of his mother.)    Sky High (2005)  Saturday at 9 p.m. on Starz  Will Stronghold (Michael Angarano, near left, with Kurt Russell) is the Harry Potter of his set in this peppy Disney action comedy, directed by Mike Mitchell. When Will enters a special high school for the children of superheroes, he's a star from the beginning because he has not one but two superhero parents: Commander and Jetstream (Mr. Russell and Kelly Preston). But life at school has its downside. Students are divided into heroes and sidekicks, depending on the powers they've inherited, and that's a blow to the self-esteem of those put on the sidekick track. And a supervillain is out for revenge, using a weapon that turns even the bravest and strongest into helpless babies.    Before the Rain (1994)  Saturday at 8 p.m. on Sundance  It's not every day that a great Macedonian film comes along. Milcho Manchevski made his writing and directing debut with this poetic and devastating comment on violence in his native country. Grégoire Colin plays a rural monk who has taken a vow of silence and finds himself hiding a young Albanian woman accused of murder. Katrin Cartlidge plays a London photo editor who sees it all, from pop stars to famine victims, and sometimes can barely tell the difference. Rade Serbedzija (above, with Ms. Cartlidge) is the war-weary Macedonian photographer with whom she's involved. It is his trip home that gives the story its power.    Short Cuts (1993)  Friday at 8 p.m. on IFC  Life in Robert Altman's Los Angeles is strange. One woman has phone sex while her husband and son are in the room and she's changing diapers.

Stein   Not long ago, a new President of humble origin, who had grown rich and famous in California, took office in the midst of general, but uneven prosperity. Soon after his inauguration, signs of a recession appeared. Upon the advice of the finest economists and business strategists he could muster, the new President proposed large tax cuts to stimulate the economy. The idea, as the President explained, was that the tax cuts would encourage a burst of new economic activity, which in turn would allow the Government to reap new revenues - eventually far more, in fact, than any initial revenue losses caused by the proposed tax cuts.   The Congress passed the tax cuts almost intact. Nevertheless, the recession worsened rapidly, and the Federal budget deficit grew. Wall Street was in turmoil. Bond prices skidded dramatically. The President consulted his economic advisers, who assured him they knew the solution.

Undoubtedly this state of mind was what anti-war propagandists call it - 'hysterical exaltation' ... but it had concrete results in stupendous patience, in superhuman endurance, in the constant re-affirmation of incredible courage.

It was one thing to have Laura Dean, Andrew De Groat and Kenneth King spinning and stamping in the early 1970's before a selective audience. When Trisha Brown did her ''accumulation'' pieces, repeating gestures and phrases in a different and less modular fashion, the sense was that new structures and new movements were still being explored. And when Lucinda Childs used repetition with complex and detailed permutations, perception was put to the test.

From there, she proceeds to tell the story of a Czechoslovak playboy obstetrician who lives with his mother, is fearful of starting his own family and romances the nurses in the delivery room while a chorus of expectant mothers scream and moan. Is this any setting for a romantic comedy? Certainly not, but \\"The Apple Game\\" turns out to be surprisingly lighthearted, all the same.Miss Chytilova's shock tactics and leaden ironies occasionally obscure the gentler merits of her movie, which was shown at the 1978 New York Film Festival and is the first new Czechoslovak film to make its American debut in a decade. Her story's two principals (Jiri Menzel, the Czechoslovak director, as the doctor and Dagmar Blahova as a sprite of a nurse who eventually gives him his comeuppance) are altogether winsome. And their courtship is outlined by Miss Chytilova with a full supply of eccentric charm.Mr. Menzel's dour, crabby obstetrician is also involved with the wife of a colleague, played by Evelyna Steimarova-Ytirova as a siren in red wool stockings who always manages to attract more attention than her lover might want. When the doctor spirits her off to a secluded spot that turns out to be the middle of a construction site, full of workers who are tickled to witness this tryst, he becomes far more disconcerted than she.Mr. Menzel, best known here for his direction of \\"Closely Watched Trains,\\" makes the doctor a hilarious fussbudget, a far more fully drawn character than might be expected to fit into the film's strict feminist scheme. Indeed, this fellow is designed to be a feminist's dartboard, affirming stereotypically wicked masculinity at every turn. Yet Mr. Menzel, and especially Miss Blahova, are so lively and disarming that personality supersedes politics much of the time.Nothing about the story, which ends on an ambiguous note that is merely vague, has the stridency or bluntness of the operating-room footage","excerpt":"that, perhaps, is the best reason why the film's opening is ill-advised.

One big hit","excerpt":"that's all that was needed to finish the job.     But the finishing blow never came today, and Seattle regained its footing in the American League Championship Series, coming back to beat the Yankees, 6-2, when reliever Jeff Nelson surrendered three consecutive hits in the fifth inning: a two-run single by Alex Rodriguez and back-to-back homers by Edgar Martinez and John Olerud.    The Yankees are in excellent position to eliminate the Mariners and advance to the World Series. They lead the series, three games to two, and will play host to the remaining games. Orlando Hernandez, undefeated in postseason play, is scheduled to pitch Game 6, against Seattle's John Halama.    But the Yankees could have closed out the Mariners here. They could have opened the 15 cases of Moet Champagne, poured most of it on one another, sipped a little of it, and enjoyed a cheery flight home before having a week of off-days and workouts before the World Series.    Now it is more complicated than that; there is work to be done. George Steinbrenner, the team's principal owner, walked out of the clubhouse sternly. ''See you in New York,'' he said.    ''We blew it,'' Sojo said. ''We had the bases loaded, I hit that double, and we didn't score after that. I thought we had it.''    The Mariners might have thought so, too. They mustered only five runs in the first four games, and Clemens made them look like Little League rejects in his one-hitter in Game 4. It was dreary and damp and cold today, and Seattle Manager Lou Piniella might have sensed the gloom in his team, screaming about an inside pitch to Martinez in the first inning that seemed harmless.    But the Yankees' starter, Denny Neagle, was tedious in his caution today, pitching as if he did not want to risk any contact by the Mariners; later he said that he felt he had made a lot of good pitches, that he pitched better than the results indicated.     Neagle reached three-ball counts against 7 of the first 13 batters he faced. He walked Mike Cameron, Rodriguez and Martinez in order in the first inning and got away with allowing just one run in the frame, but Neagle threw 30 pitches. The circumstances seemed to control him, and the count often favored the Seattle hitters.    The Mariners' Freddy Garcia had a similar outing. He was in trouble early, but the big, fatal hit eluded the Yankees, who had runners on base in each of the first three innings and could not score.    The Yankees loaded the bases with nobody out in the fourth inning, and Sojo slammed a two-run double to give them a 2-1 lead. They could sense that one big hit was all that was needed.    But Scott Brosius, who stranded two runners in the second inning, popped up for the first out, Chuck Knoblauch struck out and Derek Jeter grounded out.    The Yankees had a runner at second and one out in the fifth, and that did not produce any runs. The game was there for the taking and the Yankees passed. ''We had a chance to put them away early in the game,'' Jeter said, ''and we didn't do it.''    Mark McLemore led off the Seattle fifth with a bunt single on the third-base side. When Neagle fell behind Rickey Henderson, Nelson started throwing in the bullpen.    Nelson usually pitches in the seventh and eighth innings. But with the Yankees ahead by 2-1, both teams scheduled for a day off on Monday and three consecutive right-handed hitters set to follow Henderson, Yankees Manager Joe Torre was going for the kill. If Neagle could come back to close out the inning, or if Nelson could shut down the Mariners, then the Yankees would be four innings removed from their 37th pennant.    Neagle walked Henderson, however, giving the Mariners first and second and nobody out. After both runners advanced on Cameron's sacrifice bunt, Torre summoned Nelson, and Neagle's shoulders sagged visibly; the reality is that he has not engendered the full measure of Torre's trust. ''The competitive side of me would love to stay in,'' Neagle said, ''but that's not my call.''    Torre has relied heavily on Nelson in the postseason in his five years as the team's manager, and with Rodriguez and Martinez coming to bat, Torre was looking for Nelson to contain the damage.    But Nelson did not feel right; his fastball had been sluggish as he warmed up in the bullpen, and Nelson thought he was pitching with less than his best.    Rodriguez -- 5 for 12 in previous at-bats against Nelson -- lined a single to left field for two runs, pushing Seattle to a 3-2 lead and revitalizing the Safeco Field fans. ''I know everybody was real pumped when Alex got that hit and we took the lead,'' Olerud said.    Rodriguez led off first base with one out. He stole a base effortlessly in Game 3 with Nelson on the mound, taking advantage of the right-hander's deliberate windup, and now, in Game 5, Nelson worked hard to try to hold Rodriguez at first. Nelson threw to first five times and shortened his stride to the plate.    Nelson, however, was creating a problem for himself, falling behind Martinez, two balls and no strikes. Martinez saw all of this and took it in: Nelson was concerned with Rodriguez and might be more apt to throw a fastball to give catcher Jorge Posada a chance to cut down the runner.    With the situation and the count in his favor, Martinez looked for a fastball, and when Nelson threw a 91-mile-an-hour fastball, Martinez crushed a two-run homer to straightaway center field as the Mariners came alive again, leading by 5-2.    Nelson looked on impassively as Martinez rounded the bases, but his first fastball to Olerud was only 89 m.p.h., the diminished velocity a sign of discouragement: Olerud, too, slugged a home run to center field.    Nelson allowed two homers during the regular season and surrendered back-to-back shots in the fifth inning today; two of the four homers he has allowed this year were hit by Martinez. ''I just made some bad pitches and it cost me,'' he said.    There were a few failed rallies late in the game. Glenallen Hill struck out while pinch-hitting for Paul O'Neill with the bases loaded and two out in the seventh. But the Yankees had botched the game before that when they could not score. The Mariners will go on for at least one more game.

They promised and delivered","excerpt":"that's democracy. But then, in the run-up to the U.N. population conference in Cairo, advocates of abortion rights went a bridge too far.   Trickily avoiding the A-word, U.S. sherpas espoused a U.N. statement calling for governments to provide \\"reproductive rights\\" including 'fertility regulation\\" and \\"pregnancy termination\\" throughout the world -- as if new verbal compounds could conceal the abortion deed.    The Vatican wasn't fooled by these euphemisms, and cunningly enlisted Muslim fundamentalists to reject imposing \\"a current life style of certain opulent societies\\" (that's satanic Uncle Sam) on third-world nations.   Fine; brings the battle out in the open. But then the Vatican went too far: not only did the Pope's spokesman condescendingly refer to the U.S. Government as \\"this Administration,\\" but he publicly attacked Vice President Al Gore by name.   The Pope's representative impugned the sincerity of Gore's conciliatory assertion that the U.S. did not seek an international right to abortion. In delivering that shot, the papal spokesman seemed to suggest that the second-highest official elected by Americans was a hypocrite.   That was a personal insult issued in the Pope's name. Unless corrected, it will stand as unprecedented papal meddling in U.S. politics.    It's overreaching enough for a U.S. bishop to predict the political behavior of co-religionists, as Bishop James McHugh did yesterday with his warning of a \\"powerful incentive to American Catholics to walk away from the Democratic Party.\\" For the Pope himself to permit his official spokesman to rail against any specific American political figure demeans the Vatican -- or \\"this papacy,\\" as spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls might put it.   Reached by phone in Cairo yesterday, Gore played it cool: \\"In dealing with those who are actually negotiating at this conference,\\" he soothed, \\"I've found people to be constructive and conciliatory on both sides.\\"   He found Bishop McHugh \\"statesmanlike in saying, even though they will not accept the view that contraception is all right, nevertheless signaling they fully understand that if other organizations wish to make condoms available, they won't strenuously object.\\"   Understandably, after feminists, greens and redistributionists got carried away, Gore has been shifting the focus away from abortion to contraception, and then to a wider area of agreement: education and equality for women. Let's hope he can; Perdita Huston's seminal 1979 book, \\"Third World Women Speak Out,\\" showed that to be a key to family stability.   My objection to the new Malthusians is their insistence that crowding is the obstacle to economic growth and individual advancement. Hong Kong and Taiwan show that to be as untrue as Thomas Malthus's predictions of world starvation two centuries ago. As nations get richer and people get educated, families get smaller.   \\"Yeah, I've heard that 'Development is the best contraceptive' for 20 years,\\" counters Gore. \\"We're adopting a more holistic approach here in Cairo. Availability of contraception; increase of child survival to encourage smaller families; education and empowerment of women; and the economic development to make it easier to establish the others.\\"   Conservatives who put individual freedom first can embrace that quartet. The danger comes from the gender-agenda coercionaries overpopulating global conferences who would make governments the levelers of nations and bureaucrats the makers of family decisions. A \\"right to develop\\" is not an entitlement to a handout.   The Vatican did well to blow the whistle on the power grab of the new Malthusians; the result is the creative tension of open debate. And moral instruction by preachers has a traditional place in politics. But the Pope should tell his arrogant spokesman that he harmed the anti-abortion cause by getting politically mean.
