But outside the plate glass windows, threats lie in all directions.   To the south is Seattle Bean, an espresso bar that seemed a harmless novelty when it opened early last year at 82d Street. What hope did a few placid Oregonians in black T-shirts have against hyperactive Greeks in black vests at the Viand and at least a thousand other coffee shops in Manhattan? But dozens of espresso bars have opened in the past year, and the Viand has been hit especially hard. By spring it was surrounded. Decaf cappuccini foam two blocks north, six doors east and directly west across Second Avenue. These new espresso bars can't yet match the Viand's menu -- they don't offer a single lemon-meringue pie -- but they've already expanded into soup, sandwiches and pastries. Suddenly there are hard choices for the locals. Do they spend 60 cents for American coffee or $3.25 for a caffe latte grande? Do they drink ordinary joe at the Viand's counter while admiring a display case of pies, or sip espresso a few feet down the block at Kaspar Art Space/ Coffee while studying landscape paintings representing an \\"acute awareness of life in a fin-de-siecle world full of complications.\\" The Big City","excerpt":"The Coffee Shop, Cornered"},{"year":"1953","title":"Shank, M E: The Coffee Man Of a Time And Place","excerpt":"THE COFFEE TRAIN.

Rarely do they get everything into the car trunk without sharp words.  Is this the beginning of a cross-continental vacation or a move to a new building?     No.  These are the sure signs of a harried double life led by those who cope with two places: the city apartment and the weekend house.

A1    After Iraq Vote, Calls for Unity  The top two American officials in Iraq, in a rare open display of American influence, called for the country's main political groups to come together quickly to form a broad-based government once Thursday's election results are known, saying hopes of quelling the Sunni Arab insurgency should not be squandered by politicians.   A10    President Bush, in a detailed interview with Jim Lehrer on the PBS program ''NewsHour,'' called the elections ''a very important step'' but acknowledged that they are ''not going to stop violence'' in Iraq, and that ''we're behind'' on the training of capable Iraqi police forces.   A10    Claims of Cover-Up in China  Residents of Dongzhou, China, who claim that a police crackdown on a demonstration on Dec. 6 ended in the deaths of 20 or more people, say that they have endured beatings, bribes and threats at the hands of security forces who have tried to prevent accounts of what happened from emerging.

A6    SCIENCE/HEALTH    Stem Cell Work Defended  Hwang Woo Suk, the embattled South Korean scientist, struck back at his critics, declaring that his pioneering technology for cloning stem cells works and that he will produce proof within two weeks.   A6    NATIONAL   A14-21    Senate Blocks Bush's Call To Reauthorize Patriot Act  The Senate blocked reauthorization of the broad antiterrorism bill known as the USA Patriot Act, pitting Congress against President Bush, who has warned that the nation will be left vulnerable to attack if the measure is not quickly renewed.

A14    Hospital's Future in Doubt  Charity Hospital, which for nearly three centuries has been dedicated to treating the poorest and sickest in New Orleans, has been abandoned since Hurricane Katrina, but it is now at the center of a battle over whether it will continue to serve those most in need or become a more conventional hospital.   A16    NEW YORK/REGION   B1-6    Partial Strike Declared As Transit Talks Deadlock  The Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the transit workers' union broke off talks, leading the union to call for a strike against two Queens bus lines on Monday and against the whole transit system on Tuesday if no settlement is reached.

I went with my wife, and we had a marvelous time, talking about everything. He even took me to his garden to see his work. Then he said, ''It's chilly, isn't it? Let's have some tea.''

The treasure, enough to fill several galleries, consists of rare oil paintings and other works of art collected over many years by the Seamen's Bank for Savings.    The bank opened in 1829 to give those who followed the sea a convenient place to stow their money. When it closed last April, The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation took over the bank's assets, including 2,000 works of art, nearly all with a nautical theme. The F.D.I.C. disposed of this trove in a single lot, thus keeping intact the bank's unmatchable collection of maritime oil paintings, water colors, prints, craft work and other memorabilia recording more than 150 years of American seafaring.   New Yorkers have glimpsed the collection in the bank's offices or in occasional advertising displays.

However, on the evidence of \\"The Empire Strikes Back,\\" we won't be bored. \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\" is very much a sequel, which is to say that it expands on the first film but never outstrips it, and that it can't stand alone. But on its own terms, it's a success, because \\"Star Wars\\" was such an uncommonly hard act to follow. It's no small wonder that the first film has been followed at all.\\"The Empire Strikes Back,\\" which opens today at Loews Astor Plaza and other theaters, finds the \\"Star Wars\\" regulars retrenching for the long haul. Instead of trying to match the original film's momentum, the present effort concentrates on laying groundwork for a more extended story. So it offers hints and clues and riddles that may take eons to unravel, in exchange for the first film's happy-go-lucky humor. The jokes seem more closely geared to children this time, and there aren't nearly as many of them. Compared to its predecessor, the present film is just as polished and technically proficient, but seldom as lighthearted and seldom as much fun.The plot, which asks more insistently to be taken seriously this time, first finds the three human principals and their two robots and one Wookie on an ice planet, where the film's most spectacular battle scene takes place, very early in the story, because the new film takes little trouble to establish its own beginning, middle and end. This battle involves an attack by war machines that look like metal dinosaurs, and it is resolved when Luke Skywalker runs a tiny cord around the legs of one of these behemoths, causing it to trip.Aside from featuring some of the new film's fanciest special effects, this sequence has a welcome touch of the old \\"Star Wars\\" impishness, which is strangely absent from \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\" too much of the time. The first film's offhanded gags have virtually been cast in bronze","excerpt":"the comic shabbiness of all the space gadgetry, for example, has been expanded from a casual giggle to a full-scale running gag. And the dialogue, fueled with a heightened spirit of adventure the first time around, is more wooden now. Luke Skywalker and a fellow warrior, talking on the eve of a battle: \\"Right now I feel like I could take on the whole Empire myself.\\" \\"I know what you mean.\\"Irvin Kershner, who directed the present film, and Mr. Lucas, who produced it and was an adviser, have made the only sensible choice between the alternatives of imitating \\"Star Wars\\" or trying to outdistance it: they aim for a little of both. So some of the space-flight sequences or other special effects recall the first film, and others, like the visit with Yoda, are marked departures. Yoda is a two-foot gnome — he looks like the kind of tiny figure one might find in a novelty shop, with an inscription reading \\"Have a Lousy Day\\" — and his pointy, mobile ears are one of the movie's great marvels. Just as clever, and just as noticeably different from the first film's highlights, are a race through an asteroid shower and a mysterious cavern that licks its chops as our heroes zoom away.Much of the dialogue concerns Luke Skywalker and his sacred mission, the full shape of which will not be made clear until a future episode. But Luke, as played by Mark Hamill, can be a ponderous fellow, and this time Harrison Ford's Han Solo steals the show. Mr. Ford slips easily into the film's comic-book conversational style, and he also brings a real air of tragedy to Han's fate, which is another thing we won't exactly know about until next time.So he goes to what may or may not be his doom with a grand show of nobility, flinging his head back and staring bravely ahead. For this alone he seems to deserve Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), with whom he has a flirtation fraught with pre-adolescent sarcasm. (\\"Kiss you? I'd sooner kiss a Wookie!\\" \\"That can be arranged.\\") Princess Leia, bright-eyed and snappish as ever, is seen fixing equipment and driving the spaceship from time to time, as if someone were concerned with offering positive role models for children in the audience.Accordingly, it's too bad that the character played by Billy Dee Williams, the story's only black principal (with the possible exception of Darth Vader, whose voice is supplied most effectively by James Earl Jones), is exaggeratedly unctuous, untrustworthy and loaded with jive.\\"The Empire Strikes Back\\" is often grainier and grimier looking than its predecessor. It's also considerably more violent, what with one shot of a space-creature's intestines and a couple of bloodless amputations that no one seems to mind. Luke Skywalker, for instance, loses his hand in one sequence, and gets a new hand soon after, without even complaining about his injury. Perhaps small children in the audience will find this hard to understand. I know I did.\\"The Empire Strikes Back\\" is rated PG (\\"Parental Guidance Suggested\\"). It contains a few violent episodes, as mentioned above. Film: Robots Return In 'Empire Strikes':'Star Wars' Sequel"},{"year":"1986","title":"THE ALLIGATOR REPORT. By W. P. Kinsella.

Bratton and three of his predecessors, Patrick V. Murphy, Benjamin Ward and Richard J. Condon, spoke at New York Law School on Friday about how best to fight the perennial problem. They discussed Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's battle with the City Council over having an independent monitor oversee the force, what kind of monitor is most effective, how its members should be chosen and whether it should have subpoena powers. The discussion, part of a daylong seminar, drew on experience dating to the days of the Knapp Commission and before. GEORGE JAMES Commissioner Benjamin Ward, who wants to make commanders at the precinct level more accountable by giving them more power to fight corruption.   \\"When you ask the Mayor to be totally responsible, you either have to have this very naive Mayor that we have today, if he is, or someone that just thinks he can conquer all and is willing to take on the kind of pressure that will come to him if his commission fails to control corruption. Because what is he going to investigate? What is Nick Scoppetta  [ the head of the Mayor's oversight committee ]  and his committee going to be looking at?    They're going to be looking at Bill Bratton and  [ Internal Affairs Chief Patrick ]  Kelleher's attempts to control and suppress corruption. When they find it, who's going to be sitting in the driver's seat, when they find it? His police commissioner, Bratton. How did it start? How long was it going on before Bratton learned about it? Where did he learn about it? Did he find out about it from some Suffolk County policeman who stumbled accidentially on some city cop engaged in corruption, and so when the arrest comes down, it makes the New York City Police Department look inept and in competent because they didn't find it themselves and it was found in East Cupcake and not in the big city?    And is the Mayor going to be up there in the Blue Room saying, \\"I picked Bratton,\\" as Koch said the other day when he criticized Giuliani, said, 'You want praise? Stand next to Ben Ward and say, 'I picked Ben Ward.' Well, is he going to stand next to Bratton and say, 'I picked Bratton and this is what happened?' Because Bratton can't control all the corruption that occurs in the city.\\"  Patrick V. Murphy, commissioner from 1970 to 1973, who replaced 90 percent of the top officers in the department and incorporated many Knapp Commission recommendations, including creating a central internal affairs division.   \\"Rather than looking at the culture of the police department, look at the culture of the executive corps . . . . They are critical, and they can make things happen. I am convinced they can prevent corruption if the comissioner holds them accountable and they have the means.\\" Richard J. Condon, commissioner from 1989 to 1990, who approves of an outside monitor, be it a special prosecutor like the one appointed following the Knapp Commission, or a strong external investigative body, as was recommended by the Mollen Commission.   \\"If you have someone whose sole focus is on corruption, you should be more successful in ferreting out that corruption. And I think however the Mayor and the Council resolve the independent commission, however it turns out, I think that it will be very helpful for the Police Department.\\"  Commissioner William J. Bratton, who wants to make commanders at the precinct level more accountable by giving them more power to fight corruption.   \\"Information is also now in the process of being shared extensively with the precinct commanders. Why? to get them into the game. To include them. To empower them. To get them into the game. This is being done at great risk, because it's common wisdom -- traditional wisdom relating to internal affairs corruption issues is the fewer people in the know the better, because you might lose a case.   Well, that exclusion type of activity certainly doesn't seem to have worked in the sense that we have in 20-year cycles, whether we had a three-oh type of precinct situation or other precincts like the three-oh . . . .   And I think the time has come to try something different. I think it's radically different, something that is risky. I believe it's worked in dealing with crime. I believe it will work in dealing with the issue of corruption. Time will tell. Will I lose a few cases because somebody has a loose lip? Possibly. But will I win a lot more?    Will you as citizens in New York win a lot more? I think so. What will you win? By having those precinct commanders coming into the game, by giving them authority to deal with this, we can begin to deal with the new insidious type of corruption.\\" Discussion","excerpt":"The Commissioners on Police Corruption"},{"year":"2009","title":"Finding the right fabric for furniture is really hard","excerpt":"the commitment is scary, not to mention the cost of 17 yards of anything.

The Beekman Theater    Q. Who was the architect of the Beekman Theater, on the East Side of Second Avenue between 65th and 66th Streets? It is similar to the 1952 Manhattan House across the street, designed by Mayer & Whittlesey and Skidmore, Owings & Merrill. . . . Thomas Mellins, Robert A.M. Stern, Architects, Manhattan.    A. Like Manhattan House, the two-story-high store, theater and bank building was built in 1952 by the New York Life Insurance Company. But its architects were Fellheimer & Wagner, often identified with bank design.   New York Life apparently decided on a low-rise development it to protect its investment in the apartment house across the street","excerpt":"the company also bought the entire northerly blockfront and key parts of the blockfronts on the west and south.  161 West 75th Street    Q. My apartment house at 161 West 75th Street, like a number of others on the Upper West Side, has two intertwined initials over the door, an \\"A\\" and something else. Whose initials? And was it the architect or developer? . . . Ivan Berger, Manhattan.    A. Your building was built in 1924 to 1926 by Anthony Paterno -- they are his initials -- and was designed by Rosario Candela. Paterno was one of four brothers, all developers, who generally worked separately. Other brothers also used their initials on buildings they put up.   Joseph Paterno's architect on 905 West End Avenue, at 104th Street, designed an elaborate cartouche with \\"JP\\" over the door and annotated the 1917 drawing, \\"Architect is to approve the plaster model of this ornament before execution.\\" Other developers, like the Halls, the Campagnas and the Crystals, also left such traces of their ownership.    I have never seen written accounts of this practice by developers, but after the turn of the century the architectural press often urged architects to \\"sign\\" their creations. However, only a few architects, usually designers of speculative apartment houses, regularly did this.   The Paternos started building modest walk-ups around 1900 but by the 1920's had become one of New York's reigning builder-families. Joseph Paterno built buildings like 1220 Park Avenue, at 95th Street, and 30 Sutton Place, at 58th Street; Charles put up luxury apartments as well as Hudson View Gardens and Castle Village, north of the George Washington Bridge; Michael built 775 Park Avenue, at 72d Street, and 2 East 67th Street, and Anthony built 1040 Fifth Avenue, at 85th Street.   Generally the Paternos' legible presence on their buildings decreased as their product ascended the economic ladder. On Michael Paterno's 1105 Park Avenue, built in 1922 at the corner of 89th Street, there is only the letter \\"P\\" and even such modest inscriptions largely vanished on their top-grade buildings on Fifth and Park Avenues. This is consistent with the development in the 1910's of a general upper-class preference for apartment houses known by their street addresses rather than by a name.  126 East 24th Street    Q. In 1945 the real estate broker Charles H. Voorhees had dinner at my apartment at 126 East 24th Street. Mr. Voorhees said that as a child he had attended a French school in the same building and that it was converted to apartments only later. Was he right? . . . Kathryn Guyler, Manhattan.    A. Yes. What is now a single structure at 126 East 24th Street was originally built as a string of four-story rowhouses in 1847 by Lawson Carter, a lawyer. They were at first occupied as private houses, but in 1856 Elie Charlier moved his \\"French and English Institute for Young Gentlemen\\" to at least one of the buildings.    Voorhees was born about 1860 so he could have attended the Charlier school, which accepted boys at age 7. In 1875 Charlier moved up to Central Park South between Sixth and Seventh Avenues and the Carter family hired the architects Renwick & Sands to add a floor and change the building into modest apartments.   Frances Nightingale lived there from 1904 to 1909, just as she was establishing what became the Nightingale-Bamford School. In 1939 the architect Samuel Lichtenstein modernized the ground floor and the building now has a definite tripartite effect from three different eras -- a Moderne ground floor, the original Italianate middle section and a top section with an elaborate Victorian brick cornice.  3 East 81st Street    Q. There is an interesting building (very tiny) wedged just behind 998 Fifth Avenue. Could this have been an old carriage house? . . . Sylvia Steinbrock, Manhattan.    A. The first building at 3 East 81st Street was one of a row of brownstones completed in 1879. In 1908 the actress Maxine Elliott bought the house and had the architects Hunt & Hunt redesign it with a limestone front. She occupied it with a cousin and five servants. Miss Elliott's obituary in The New York Times in 1940 described her as \\"one of America's most noted actresses,\\" with a 30-year career beginning with her debut in 1890.    She retired around 1920 and moved to France.   In 1928 she sold the house to the owner of 998 Fifth Avenue, the apartment building at the corner. The house was then demolished but the first-floor facade was retained with a garden behind, apparently as a light protector for the larger building. This structure, with Maxine Elliott's doorway, is what survives on the site. 910 Fifth Avenue    Q. Is it true that the white brick apartment house at 910 Fifth Avenue at 72d Street is really an older structure? The ceilings are pretty high for a postwar building. . . . John Foreman, Halstead Property Company, Manhattan.    A. You're right. Another giveaway clue is the surviving trace of limestone on the easterly lot line wall, toward Madison Avenue. In 1920 the developer Fred F. French put up a limestone-front apartment house of simplexes and duplexes of up to 18 rooms with a sheltered driveway. In 1955 the architects Sylvan and Robert Bien filed plans to add four new floors and rebuild the interior according to \\"new concepts of space utilization\\" as The New York Times put it in 1959.   These concepts meant apartments of three and a half to eight rooms renting for $500 to $1,415 a month. Robert Bien, now a partner at Eggers & Higgins, says changes in window patterns required the changes in the facade, which would have been done anyway.   \\"In those days,\\" he said, \\"we wanted it to look like a new building, adding that \\"white glazed brick was the most expensive, and the most elegant\\" material available in the industry at the time.

Except one: No. 5, Eva Cassidy.    Cassidy, right, was an angelic-voiced but little-known singer whose death from cancer at 33, in 1996, inspired a phenomenal demand for her renditions of songbook standards, jazz and gospel, leading to six posthumous albums culled from unreleased recordings. She's not necessarily out of place on Amazon's list, which skews wildly toward white pop-rock (the only solo black artist is Ray Charles at No. 23) and hardly reflects album sales beyond Amazon. But ahead of Bob Dylan (No. 9), Bruce Springsteen (No. 12) and Elvis (No. 25)?    The explanation probably lies in the rise of the Internet as a tastemaker, and the explosive growth of online commerce that Amazon itself pioneered. The independent Blix Street label began releasing Cassidy's recordings in 1998, the year Amazon added music to its inventory. A word-of-mouth campaign, fueled by chat rooms and fan sites, began to seep into the news media, and by December 2000 two Cassidy albums had pushed a top-selling Beatles compilation down to No. 3 at Amazon, with three other Cassidy albums at Nos. 4, 5 and 7.

Ms. Savage is a respected freelance financial journalist, but that admiring comment shows what's wrong with her going on the board. As an independent observer, she has credibility when she says what she thinks. Can she be truly independent as a corporate director who receives $24,000 a year plus $2,000 per meeting for her services?   Ms. Savage gives financial advice and conducts interviews on CBS's Chicago outlet, WBBM-TV, and writes a personal finance column for The Chicago Sun-Times and The Dallas Times-Herald. The Sun-Times's editor, Dennis Britton, calls her \\"an absolute dynamo\\" and \\"scrupulously honest,\\" but concedes that the Big Mac connection raises questions. WBBM-TV is drawing up a written agreement on the scope of her coverage -- e.g., nothing on McDonald's, its competitors or suppliers.   Ms. Savage's commentaries are general -- such as how to balance a checkbook, and leasing versus buying a car -- not stock tips. She says corporate affiliation won't affect the things she writes and talks about, and that she will avoid subjects that might relate to McDonald's.

Here's the question: Is there a place in the brave new world of managed health care for municipal hospitals like New York's? Can they possibly survive? The answer, from a mayoral advisory panel, was a resounding no. The panel, saying the hospitals delivered inefficient, low-quality care, called last week for abolition of the whole system. The obvious question, from a 43-year-old Bellevue patient with AIDS, was this: \\"Where will the poor people go for medical care?\\" The mayor's panel, though, insisted that the poor will get better care at revamped hospitals or at private medical centers. LAWSUITS  Promises, Costly Promises  It happens all the time: some big company, on the prowl for bargain labor, closes one plant and opens another elsewhere. As long as it goes by the book and gives 60 days' notice, the company's nose is clean. Or so Maytag thought when, in 1991, it shut a vending-machine plant in West Virginia and opened one in South Carolina. Workers say Maytag assured them this would never happen, and the workers -- first one, then a class-action parade -- decided this was a legal promise and sued. And last week Maytag settled the case by agreeing to pay $16.5 million -- it was \\"risk avoidance,\\" mind you","excerpt":"the company remained pure as a new-laundered sheet. Lawyers, bless their billable souls, will devour $5 million of that, but that still leaves a tidy sum for 800 workers.  ENTERTAINMENT  Rocking Hollywood's Boat  Think of Hollywood as a huge rowboat, managing a delicate balance even under its heavy load of ego and money -- mighty agents on one side, mighty studios on the other. Then, without warning, a giant among giants leaps from one side to the other, sending everyone else scampering for equilibrium. That's basically what happened last week when Michael Ovitz, agent to the gods and just about everyone else, decided that, well, working for a studio might not be that bad. MCA hadn't worked out, so the buzz (sorry, but Hollywoodspeak is de rigueur) was that nothing would shake him from Creative Artists. But then Disney came calling -- its new jewel, ABC, in hand -- and Mr. Ovitz couldn't resist, even though he'll play second fiddle to Michael Eisner, Disney's chairman. You can bet he'll be a loud second fiddle. GUIDING NATURE  Writing E-Mail in the Sand  Beaches are big business -- people go to unholy lengths to sit on them and fry, and pay unholy prices for shelter and hot dogs nearby. But only God can make a beach -- well, God and the Army Corps of Engineers. The big difference: when engineers do it, it costs hundreds of millions of dollars. And when God then washes away man's sand, there's hell to pay -- and more sand to cart in. Take, say, New Jersey. Man built beaches recently at vast expense -- Federal money that miraculously flowed freely -- but (of all the nerve!) water barged in and took much of it away. And so the debate heats up, with some insisting that, yes, man can shape the earth, but other heretical souls (they probably don't even like running barefoot on the sand) talking about pouring tax dollars into the ocean.  REGULATION  A Tobacco-Country Judge  The battle is joined. The F.D.A. wants to regulate the sale and promotion of cigarettes -- because it wants fewer teen-agers to start smoking. The tobacco industry doesn't like that idea, possibly because if people don't get the habit young, they usually don't get it. So the industry sued, and by all signs got just the arbiter it would want last week -- a North Carolina judge who had ruled pro-tobacco in a suit involving the E.P.A. and had, as a lawyer, defended an R.J. Reynolds heir. Why North Carolina? It's \\"the only jurisdiction that makes any sense,\\" Reynolds said. But the head of an anti-smoking group said, \\"Among Southern lawyers, it's called home cooking, helping out the friends and neighbors.\\"  ROCKEFELLER CENTER  What Price Location Now?  What next? Just when you thought you'd figured out who owns Rockefeller Center -- no simple matter, in case you've missed it all; the overlapping trusts and groups and holding companies create a dazzling financial maze -- here come two more investors battling for a piece of it. First was Sam Zell of Chicago, who, like others drawn to the fabled towers, is all gaga about \\"location, location, location,\\" a rule he learned \\"when my daddy put me on his knee.\\" (Well, at least his daddy didn't say, \\"Plastics.\\") And the very next day this bankruptcy-smudged landmark got a rival offer, from Tishman Speyer Properties of New York. Don't even ask what the ownership chart might look like now; the family tree of British royalty is a sapling in comparison.  THE FED  A Rate Cut? Probably Not  Oh, yes -- interest rates. Is the Federal Reserve going to give borrowers another break, as it did a month or so ago, when it cut rates slightly after that endless string of increases? The Fed gathers on Tuesday, but people who think they know such things expect no more rate cuts just yet. True, official rates still hover farther than usual above inflation -- which the Fed is slapping itself gleefully on the back for taming. But Fed officials seem to think things are going just fine, with a sharp rise in housing starts last week just the latest bit of strength. Or perhaps it's just too hot for them to think about anything so strenuous as tinkering with those all-powerful rates. Maybe in September.  EQUALITY  Women of Value  Life is unfair: Any 12-year-old denied extra dessert or a new computer will tell you that. But for the world's women, life is truly unfair -- as a United Nations report out last week made vividly and statistically clear. Among the findings: 70 percent of the world's poor are women, and women hold just 14 percent of top managerial jobs. Not that women don't do their fair share of the world's work -- far from it. One of the study's more intriguing findings is the extreme economic undervaluation of women's work. They pull their weight; they just don't get paid for it.  WORK FORCE  Employees, by Another Name  No one wants employees anymore. Employees want pesky things like health benefits. (Health benefits?) They want companies to be loyal to them. (A quaint idea.) You have to pay payroll taxes so they can get stuff like Social Security. It's all such a nuisance! More and more, companies prefer \\"independent contractors\\" -- not too independent, mind you -- and the ranks of such semi-employees have soared with all the layoffs lately. But there are rules about who can be called a contractor -- rules, no doubt, often stretched to, and past, the limit -- and last week Texas A&M University admitted that it had illegally paid 400 farm workers as contractors, cheating the Government out of $86,000 in payroll taxes. The Republicans, meanwhile, have a solution: they're pushing a bill that would liberalize the use of contractors.

ABC's \\"American Film Institute Salute to Clint Eastwood\\" follows the standard script for these generally classy occasions. An announcer intones, \\"Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Clint Eastwood\\"; the star enters to a standing ovation, sits with loved ones, in this case his mother and new wife, and then proceeds to smile gamely as his life and career are reduced to film clips and sound bites. (Mr. Eastwood had a similar experience several weeks ago when he was honored by the Film Society of Lincoln Center.) Still, this event has a smidgen more dignity than most televised award shindigs, even when the zany Jim Carrey is one of the  hosts.          Actually, Mr. Carrey turns out to be something of a surprise. After introducing himself as America's highest-paid boy king and recalling how he used a tiny part in \\"The Dead Pool\\" to approach an unimpressed Mr. Eastwood with some valuable directing tips, the hyperactive comic settles down for a smooth performance. Added to his \\"Saturday Night Live\\" appearance last week, in which he impersonated a physically feeble but sharp-witted James Stewart railing about the adolescent antics of a comic named Jim Carrey, this stint is yet another shrewd exercise in career broadening. Mr. Carrey could well end up snagging Hollywood's most elusive role, permanent host for the Oscars.

Something deeper is involved, something that separates the respected composer of our time from the more raffish and more colorful types who preceded him in history: our composers for the most part have never shown any desire to become celebrated public performers and do not have the virtuoso's volatile temperament.   What would we say today if we picked up the newspaper and discovered that Modern Composer X, a tenured professor at Ivyclad University, had gone mad with the fear of oncoming mediocrity and thrown himself in the river, like Schumann?

Even Hollywood, which used to have self-imposed codes to insure that no picture could end without some assurance that the bad guys would be punished, long ago abandoned any such moralistic stance. Nowadays, the cowboy in the white hat who rides into town on a white horse is as likely to have bank robbery or rape in mind as any nobler aim. And he likely will get away with it, often in lovely color and excruciatingly slow motion.   However, perhaps because new works virtually stopped entering the repertory half a century ago, opera has not caught up with the times. There are exceptions, certainly, especially from the centuries when opera was still an aristocratic entertainment. Monteverdi's ''The Coronation of Poppea,''for instance, is a sensuous story of two appealing young lovers, Nero and the woman for whom he murdered his wife, Octavia. Mozart's mature operas take so subtle and humane a view of moral lapses that Count Almaviva, Don Giovanni and the unfaithful lovers of ''Cosi fan tutte'' elicit more sympathy than blame. But in the struggle between good and evil that serves as the nexus of almost all later, grander operas, evil is the foreordained loser.

For the newcomer, which began a stand at the Rialto on Saturday, is, despite its seemingly-authentic soundtrack and an occasional exciting sequence, familiar and not especially startling fare.The area this expedition—composed of a group of scientists sent out by the French Government and the Museum of Man—is concentrating on is the Ogowe River, flowing 600 miles from the heart of the Congo to the coast.Its purpose, the narrators say, is to make a record of the peoples, their customs and \\"what makes them tick.\\" One of the equatorial tribes encountered on the journey, which was made in the long, hollow-log pirogues of the country, are pygmies, who oblige with a hunt for an antelope and a snarling leopard, who happens to be around to snarl and be slaughtered for the camera.

The film's climax and its high point in novelty is the stalking of a gorilla herd, a band, which, when trapped, takes to the trees. Despite this decidedly unusual maneuver, the leader, a 700-pound mammoth, makes, oddly enough, a pitiable picture when he finally is shot down.Although it is the professed intention of the expedition's scientists to capture a record of a people, some of whom are dying out, the dances caught seem for some reason to be strangely accented on nudity and fertility.

A Day for Martin Luther King"},{"year":"1991","title":"THE ECONOMY Greenspan Points a Finger at the Persian Gulf War  Jittery consumers and rising unemployment have made Alan Greenspan change his optimistic tone. On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve Board chairman said that if the war drags on for more than three months, consumers will turn gloomy and the recession will become severe. On Friday, with a dismal unemployment report, he led the board in a unanimous vote to lower the discount rate a half-point to 6 percent, the second cut in six weeks.  Banks responded by reducing their prime lending rate a half-point also, to 9 percent. Mr. Greenspan might be doing some pre-emptive rate-cutting and explaining. Politicians say he shares the blame for the recession, President Bush used his State of the Union address to press for lower interest rates, and Mr. Greenspan comes up for reappointment in August. If the economy does crash, Mr. Greenspan is in effect saying blame the war, not me. The Falling Payroll  So much for the notion of a stabilizing economy. The Government said Friday that the nation's payrolls fell by 232,000 jobs and that the average workweek was a half-hour shorter in January. The unemployment rate climbed only one-tenth of a point, to 6.2 percent for the month, the highest rate since 1987, but analysts agreed that the figure understated the deterioration of the economy.    Is It Over Yet?  The bleak unemployment picture undermined the weak hint of a recovery in the Government's forecasting gauge, which sent the stock market on a brief mid-week spree. The index of leading indicators for December rose one-tenth of 1 percent, the first sign of growth in six months. Last week's figures on durable goods orders and personal income also came in rosier than expected, if not in full bloom. But many economists want to wait until March or April to decide if sunnier days are truly here. \\"You have to see three or four months before you see a story,\\" said Lawrence Kudlow, chief economist at Bear Stearns. The decline might be slowing, he said, but he won't declare the recession over. America's Medical Bill  It's as if corporate America's largest stockholders, and most insistent greenmailers, were the M.D.'s. Last year, medical costs swallowed up 26 percent of the average company's earnings. The average cost for each employee rose 17.1 percent to $3,217, according to a survey that A. Foster Higgins & Company, a benefits consulting firm, publicized last week. \\"You cannot have increases like that and continue to be competitive internationally,\\" said Philip R. Lee, who directs the Institute for Health Policy Studies at the University of California at San Francisco. Costs were highest, at $3,500 an employee, in the Middle Atlantic region, which has relatively few cost-containment plans. Dr. Lee admits that, as an Assistant Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare in the 1960's, he was mistaken to expand the supply of doctors in hopes of controlling costs. In general, he now says, the more doctors per capita, the higher a state's medical costs. Many doctors aim to achieve target incomes with busy practices that generate a host of tests and hospital admissions. The Fed's Chain Reaction  Minutes after the Government released unemployment figures for January on Friday, the Federal Reserve lowered the boom on interest rates to stimulate the economy. The move set off a chain reaction among the banks, including J.P. Morgan and Citibank, which lowered their rates. But economists say further cuts will be needed before the economy changes direction. And many are much grimmer about the forecast, saying hard times may last until next year rather than this summer. Dissension on the Bank Fund  Last week, L. William Seidman, the nation's top banking regulator, sounded more optimistic about the banking system than either the White House or Congress. Mr. Seidman, remember, was so gloomy last year that Administration officials frequently urged him to leave public life. On Thursday, he said no taxpayer bailout would be needed to keep the bank insurance fund afloat. The fund, rapidly dwindling, will remain solvent, he said, adding, \\"There is no crisis here.\\" The Office of Management and Budget predicted that the fund will have a deficit in 1992","excerpt":"the Congressional Budget Office predicted one by the end of 1991. COMPANIES   Intel's Japanese-Style Strategy  Let other companies scatter their money on high dividends and other means of filling short-term investors with glee. The Intel Corporation will spend as much as $1 billion this year on plant and equipment, probably outdoing any other semiconductor company in the United States or Japan. In the flush times of 1988, Intel spent $450 million. The company is adopting the Japanese strategy of raising capital spending in a recession to charge ahead of competitors. Unfair Advantage for Airlines?  Finally, Eastern Airlines' creditors heard some unexpected good news: the carrier's airport gates and flight slots have brought so much interest that the bankruptcy judge handling the liquidation has scheduled an auction for Monday. Airlines are among the likely bidders. The Justice Department's antitrust lawyers -- sensing something anti-competitive about, say, Delta Air Lines maybe having 87 percent of Atlanta's passengers -- have promised to review the sales. A new No. 1 to the sun? Airlines trying to climb out of bankruptcy proceedings usually don't look for ways to expand. But Continental Airlines is trying to capture Eastern Airline's traffic between New York and Florida. Continental added 32 flights last week -- a dozen from Newark to Florida. I.R.S. Catches an Outlaw  Farmers are now doing well enough to organize a concert called \\"Willie-Aid.\\" Mr. Nelson has long cultivated an image as a musical renegade, an outlaw, and now the Internal Revenue Service has taken him at his word, demanding $16.7 million in back taxes. The I.R.S. has auctioned off his Texas ranch, his grand piano and a golf cart shaped like a Rolls-Royce. If the proceeds fall short of the tax bills, Willie Nelson's fans -- Texans, country music lovers and other prideful separatists -- will find that going to his concerts means supporting the Treasury of the United States.  Gannett's Tonic for Low Profits  The Gannett Company posted its first annual earnings decline since going public in 1967. It is the nation's largest chain of newspapers; its flagship, USA Today, is known to be sassy, quick-reading and upbeat. Gannett earned $377 million, about $20 million less than the year before. The company's advice: * Don't blame us. The economy's bad. * Hold the stock. Things might get better. * Buy our newspapers to cheer you up. USX Separation  The USX Corporation filed papers last week for a trial separation from its traditional business of making steel. At the insistence of Carl C. Icahn, the company's largest stockholder, USX agreed to separate its energy and steel operations by issuing new stock for the steel. Mr. Icahn, who has said that spinning off steel would raise the value of USX shares, agreed to buy no more of the company's stock for seven years. Rules of Auction  New York's leading auction houses defended their right last week to accept bids from inanimate objects like chandeliers. Auctioneers recognize \\"chandelier bids\\" to get things going when nobody else bids an item up to the secret minimum price. The practice is legal in New York City, but some at a state legislative hearing on Wednesday questioned whether it should be. \\"It's nothing short of an effort to deceive people into thinking there's real competition when their isn't any,\\" said one leading dealer. But John L. Marion, chairman of Sotheby's North America, said a secret reserve price is a \\" time-tested and universally accepted device to protect sellers from accepting too low a price.\\" In Brief  Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation Ltd. reached an agreement last week to reschedule $7.8 billion in debts due this month. The debts, which underwrote Mr. Murdoch's global media expansion, are now due in February 1994. INTERNATIONAL   Fighting Inflation in Brazil  All it took to set off a run on cooking gas in Brazil was for President Fernando Collor de Mello to go on television with a warning to conserve it. On Thursday, his Government tried to order a halt to inflation; the monthly rate is now 20 percent. It froze wages and prices and abolished inflation-indexed savings accounts. The plan's success is at best uncertain. The Government insists that the move is an extension of the inflation-fighting program unveiled last year, which included freezing about two-thirds of the money supply. Wage and price controls during the late 1980's capped inflation only temporarily, and now Brazil has fallen into the worst recession in a decade.   Argentina's 'Last, Best Chance'  In Argentina, President Carlos Saul Menem treats every economic ailment with the same prescription: a new Economy Minister. With prices again soaring and the country's financial markets plunging, Mr. Menem named Domingo Cavallo on Tuesday as his fourth Economy Minister in less than 19 months. Riordan Roett, a Latin America specialist at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, said Mr. Menem might finally have a Minister with the prestige, charisma and political skill to bring the President's free-market reforms to fruition. \\"He is probably the last, best chance,\\" Dr. Roett said. The nation's investors, familiar with Mr. Cavallo's record as Foreign Minister, celebrated by bidding up stock prices 30 percent the next day. But inflation is so severe -- the price of sugar was up 40 percent early last week -- that many shops refuse to take credit cards for fear the currency will be worth less when the banks settle. \\"The problem is, the Argentinians don't believe in Argentina,\\" Dr. Roett said.

The conscience clause would allow a hospital or doctor to refuse to provide any service on the basis of religious or moral objections. One version also allows health plans and employers to exclude any services from the insurance they provide if they object to them on moral or religious grounds. So while a national health-care plan might cover contraceptive services, Catholic hospitals, for example, could as a matter of Federal law be absolved from providing those services.

The General Motors Corporation lost $1.1 billion and the Ford Motor Company lost $574.4 million in the third quarter. The Chrysler Corporation reports earnings this week and big losses are expected. Sales are down for Japanese auto makers, but most are still showing profits. \\"Don't blame this on Bob Stempel,\\" said James Womack, co-author of \\"The Machine That Changed the World.\\" Mr. Stempel is G.M.'s chairman. The problem, Mr. Womack says, is that as companies move to newer production techniques they are more vulnerable to the economy's ups and downs. The Japanese manage their economy better, he said, so their companies do better. \\"Lean production can't function in the extreme cyclicality that is normal in this country,\\" he said. What will turn things around? \\"I can't see a way out without the Government stepping in. It's starting to happen with mini-vans.\\"  Bad Timing for F.D.I.C. Chief  William Taylor took over as chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation last week. He may wish he hadn't. Just after his confirmation, the F.D.I.C. told Congress it was tripling its estimate of how much money it will need next year to protect the nation's bank deposits. Instead of a \\"mere\\" $3 billion, the F.D.I.C. said it will require $9.6 billion. In 1993, it will need $8.7 billion more. The F.D.I.C. estimates that more than 200 banks will fail next year with assets of about $86 billion. But the estimates assume the economy will grow at about 3.5 percent, which is unlikely. If it continues to limp along the fund could require as much as $28.9 billion over the next two years, the F.D.I.C. said. That casts a pall over the Administration's proposal to raise the F.D.I.C.'s credit line to $30 billion for two years. In a slow-growth economy -- with $28.9 billion needed -- there would be just $1.1 billion left to insure about $2.3 trillion of deposits -- not much of a safety net. It is now up to Mr. Taylor to mend that net. A Big-Ticket Surprise  Durable goods are big-ticket items like refrigerators and railroad cars. They are supposed to last at least three years (some actually do). These big items are an important engine for the economy. But according to the Commerce Department, sales of these goods took a 3.2 percent slide in September after falling 4.1 percent in August. Economists were surprised","excerpt":"the consensus was that orders for durables would increase by 1 percent. The Economy's Political Clout  After the coalition forces defeated Iraq in March, President Bush's popularity soared. But since then confidence in Mr. Bush's ability to manage the economy took the mother of all tumbles. According to the most recent New York Times/CBS News poll released last week, 57 percent of Americans disapprove of the way Mr. Bush is handling the economy. Sixty percent feel \\"things\\" have gotten \\"pretty seriously off on the wrong track.\\" In January -- even as the gulf war loomed -- only 31 percent of all Americans thought so. The recent poll said 44 percent of Americans feel the country is in worse shape now than it was five years ago. With just 13 months left to the election, Mr. Bush had better hope the slow-growth economy has a quick rebound. The 'Beige Book' Looks Bleak  The Federal Reserve's \\"beige book,\\" released last week, was hardly a confidence builder. The book is a compilation of reports from the Fed's 12 regional banks. The book said the recovery had lost much of its oomph in September and early October. Retail sales were flat; factory output -- while improving -- was doing so at a laggardly pace. How will the Fed react to its own book? \\"It will cut the discount rate by Thanksgiving to about 4.5 percent,\\" said David Hale, chief economist at Kemper Financial Services in Chicago. Such a cut, he said, will drive money out of money-market accounts and into stocks.  A Whole New Telephone Game  The Federal Communications Commission proposed last week that local telephone companies be allowed to package and transmit video programs on their wires. With next-generation fiber-optics lines phone companies could offer a myriad of interactive services from entertainment libraries, recipe banks and educational programs, each tailored to a customer's needs. The $18 billion cable industry is likely to fight (unsuccessfully) against the ruling. \\"Among the top two or three concerns of every cable operator has always been head-to-head competition against local telephone companies,\\" said John Mansell, of Paul Kagan Associates, a research firm.  COMPANIES   End of an Era at Compaq  Legend has it Rod Canion wrote the business plan for the Compaq Computer Corporation on a napkin while seated in a Houston coffee shop. Six years after he founded Compaq, it was a $2 billion company dominating the portable-computer and I.B.M.-clone market and Mr. Canion was its chief executive. But though Compaq got off to a quick start in the 1980's, it has languished in the 1990's, losing market share to a new generation of clone makers. Early last week the company reported a loss of $70.3 million in the third quarter, its first ever, compared with a $123.6 million profit the year before. To cut costs, the company announced it would slash its work force by 1,400. Late in the week, Compaq raised the number to 1,401, when its board of directors relieved Mr. Canion of his job. Eckhard Pfeiffer, Compaq's executive vice president, will take over. Chase's Impressive Showing  Chase Manhattan managed to turn in a third-quarter profit of $136 million. For a company that was near the brink due to a huge portfolio of bad real estate and foreign loans, the turnaround reported last week was impressive. Chase, which had $630 million in losses for the same period a year ago, embarked on a massive cost-cutting program last year. That program -- coupled with lower interest rates, which gave the bank larger spreads between what it pays for money and what it charges -- helped make the company profitable. \\"Chase is turning itself around,\\" said Thomas Hanley, a bank analyst at Salomon Brothers.  Time Warner Inches Back  When Time Warner Inc. released its earnings reports last week, the big media company seemed to be limping its way back to health. True, Time Warner lost money -- $62 million in the third quarter -- but that was significantly less than the $91 million it lost in the comparable period the previous year. Revenue in the third quarter rose (somewhat) to $2.94 billion, from $2.90 billion a year ago. And some of the big media company's units, like the records group, showed genuine strength. Prodigy Can Do No Right  A year ago Prodigy Services Company, one of the largest electronic bulletin boards and information services, got into trouble for screening the subscribers' messages. Rights groups, like the American Civil Liberties Union, said Prodigy had no business censoring those communications. Last week, Prodigy got into trouble for not censoring its subscribers' messages. The Anti-Defamation League, a division of B'nai B'rith, accused the information service of failing to prohibit anti-Semitic messages some subscribers were putting on the company's electronic bulletin boards. The organization said that since Prodigy advertised itself as a \\"family service,\\" it should keep certain messages off the screen. The A.C.L.U. disagreed. \\"The way to answer speech is with speech,\\" said Jerry Berman, director of the A.C.L.U.'s technology information project.  The Clifford Defense  When Clark M. Clifford testified before Congress about his involvement with the Bank of Credit and Commercial International last week, he told the same story he has told twice before. He was deceived by B.C.C.I., the bank accused of wrongdoings such as working with terrorists and laundering money for drug lords. But a former B.C.C.I. official, Abdur Sakhai, told the committee earlier that Mr. Clifford, a former Defense Secretary, and Robert A. Altman, his law partner, knew about B.C.C.I.'s ownership of First American Bancshares, the Washington bank for which Mr. Clifford served as chairman. Mr. Clifford denied the accusations. \\"We have not violated any law,\\" he said. \\"We have not committed any impropriety.\\" Senator John F. Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, presented the witnesses with documents that he said seemed to tie them to B.C.C.I. and that suggested they knew who really owned First American. \\"Totally untrue,\\" Mr. Clifford said of the charges. Salomon Brothers Inc. estimated the profits it made from its illegal bidding in the Treasury securities market at between $17 million and $19.7 million. INTERNATIONAL   Snatching the Soviet Purse  Mikhail S. Gorbachev borrowed an idea from Alexander Hamilton last week. The Soviet President decreed that the Bank for Foreign Economic Affairs would be the sole agency responsible for servicing the country's foreign debts. The decree was approved by leaders of 10 republics eager to rid themselves of debts. But like Hamilton, Mr. Gorbachev was not making an altruistic gesture. By taking responsibility for foreign credits, the central Government in Moscow will also be at the center of any future borrowing. As Hamilton knew, power rests with the purse.  A Car of One's Own, Literally  Unlike previous shows, the companies that mounted displays at the Tokyo auto show last week highlighted their smaller, sportier and -- yes -- more frugal entrants into the market. Some, like Mazda's HR-X, were powered by hydrogen. Others were electric. But some attending the show said the car everyone wanted to see was not displayed: Saturn, made by G.M. in Tennessee. The Saturn is called America's import fighter.  The General Strike That Wasn't  When strikes were common in Italy, Italians joked that only when the country's union leaders went out on strike did everything work. No more. Italy is a smoothly running, smoothly growing country that recently surpassed Britain in per capita income and has little labor unrest. So last week, when the unions called a four-hour general strike to protest the budget-cutting plans of Prime Minister Giulio Adreotti, they met with meager success. A lot of workers went out -- but not enough to stop the country. And when they did go out, they were just as apt to grab a long lunch as to take to the streets.

His current shadow adventure is a mixture of gentle pathos and Big Bertha exploits. In some respects it gives one a foggy notion of Chaplin's picture \\"The Kid,\\" but it happens only too often in this present production that the bright bits are followed by a barrage of buffoonery that has about as much right in the narrative as a chimney sweep would have in a flour mill","excerpt":"the consequence is that these boisterous attempts to wring laughter from audiences have all the humor of Babe Ruth playing Peter Pan or Betty Bronson trying to make a home run in a world series game.Mr. Langdon in some sequences again reveals himself to be a gifted player, and the pity is that he has been inveigled into using gags that detract from the continuity of the subject. The story of \\"Three's a Crowd\\" begins a little late, for the initial chapters are concerned with showing, sometimes in no deft fashion, that Harry (the character) is an ingenious young man who longs to be a husband and a father.At first he is perceived being wakened by a reliable alarm clock at 5 in the morning. Mr. Langdon in this stretch does some really clever work in depicting Harry unwilling to leave the arms of Morpheus. Below his window, his early-rising employer is bellowing to Harry to get up. However, before Harry leaves his room he has to appear for the benefit of his public in a flannel nightgown and then, as time wears on, he takes a bath under an improvised shower, the main feature of which is a garden watering can. Then Harry becomes silly and soon, through the unerring aim of his employer, he emerges covered with soot from his own stovepipe.You go from Spring to a Winter's snowstorm in a series of dissolves, and when the ground is well blanketed with white Harry discovers an exhausted young woman. He carries her up the long outside flight of stairs leading to his quaint abode, and not long after a half a dozen doctors have arrived, Harry is informed that the stork has hovered over his dwelling. In a subsequent chapter Harry is perceived striving to quiet the child by twists of his (Harry's) cherubic countenance, and at one juncture he is rather alarmed, for, while squinting for the infant's benefit, he discovers that he can't get one of his eyes to gaze in the direction he wishes. Eventually, much to Harry's relief, the eye goes back into place.This picture goes on to show that the hopes of Harry are blighted through the arrival of the young woman's husband, whose father had \\"forgiven everything.\\" But Harry inadvertantly evens up matters with a dusky fortune teller, who had insisted that the story would have a happy ending for him.On the program is also the fifth of Will Rogers's film travelogues, in which the cowboy-comedian conducts the audience through Switzerland and Bavaria. It is good fun and informative.The novel idea of putting on an ancient pictorial feature and then having a man on the stage read the titles and poke fun at the actions of the characters, created loud outbursts of laughter. Don Barclay officiated as the title-reader, explaining that it may save some in the audience trouble. The feature that serves as his target is David W. Griffith's old melodrama, \\"A Romance of the North Woods,\\" in which are seen Lillian Gish, Dorothy Gish, Lionel Barrymore, Harry Carey and Henry B. Walthall.Mr. Barclay, in person, urges the hero to hurry, and calls attention to the torn note that is not torn in one particular scene. He has a fund of material in this drama, for one of the titles reads:\\"Every pretty face was a magnet for his wiles.\\"Another sets forth:\\"He could not utter what his heart felt.\\"When the inevitable struggle between two strong men comes on, Mr. Barclay, after the fall of one of the fighters, evoked merriment by saying:\\"Now, Lionel, go to a neutral corner.\\"Mr. Barclay frequently read about half a title and then wound up by telling the spectators that they could read the rest for themselves.

Actually this film feature doesn't remind one the least bit of Mr. Fitch's play, the background of which was New York. The backgrounds of the picture are, in turn, Spain and Porto Rico.Irene Rich, the Mrs. Erlynne of the pictorial conception of Oscar Wilde's play \\"Lady Windermere's Fan,\\" is seen in this bizarre affair as the Duchess of Aragon. After a flash or so the King, a sturdy chap with an eye for a fair face, signifies his intense appreciation of the Duchess of Aragon, which brings about the first phase of conflict in the story. Thereafter the yarn, however, hops, skips and jumps along, and seven years pass, and the Duchess, then in Porto Rico, has become a martinet on a hacienda. The air seems to have agreed with her, for she does not look a day older, but rather a day younger than she did when in the court of Ferdinand VII.The Duchess, who rides like a Hoot Gibson or a Tom Mix, has been forced, through the conspiracy of the King's mistress, to leave her daughter in old Madrid. When the girl is found to be in Porto Rico, on the edge of a muddy pool, the Duchess decides to give battle to a brigand who had stolen the lovely doughter. So in the centre of the water you perceive the Duchess and the brigand slashing their swords, and then the Duchess, who appeared to be a rival of Fairbanks, John and Lionel Barrymore and John Gilbert, loses her weapon. But there is help in the offing, and it is noticed in the fighting that follows that the brigand is bitten both by the Duchess and a mere male who comes to her assistance.Miss Rich is busy in this picture. The acting of the others is according to the demands of the story.There are several Vitaphone subjects on the program, but the best of them all is one of the first that was presented—Giovanni Martinelli's rendition of \\"Vesti la giubba,\\" from \\"I Pagliacci.\\" Review 1 -- No Title","excerpt":"The Consequences of Good Looks."},{"year":"1955","title":"Secretary Dulles has now officially described the situation in the Formosa area as a de facto cease-fire.

Within days, the bombing had been tightly woven into the sprawling conspiracy theories that have obsessed some Americans since the beginning of the Republic.

Ten years ago, when the composer Gunther Schuller directed this annual weeklong celebration of modernity within the Tanglewood Festival, the series was a fortress of sober post-tonal rationalism. But tastes were changing, and in 1984, after braving a few seasons of opposition to his programming vision, Mr. Schuller resigned his directorship.    Since then, the festival's image has softened, but Tanglewood has shown that an openness to competing and even antagonistic styles need not mean an abandonment of standards. The English composer Oliver Knussen, the director in recent years, has forced Minimalist and Serialist works to rub shoulders. His programs could seem either ecumenical or ill conceived, depending on one's sensibilities, but this approach is increasingly becoming the standard for new-music concerts.

To come upon it unsuspecting is a little like opening an Almond Joy wrapper and finding inside the arrangement of fish, rice and seaweed known as nori maki.The effect is surprising","excerpt":"the contents prove, upon examination, not unattractive; but the product as a whole has a potential for evoking revulsion or ridicule from anyone whose mind clenches at the exotic or whose heart is firmly set upon an Almond Joy.Yakuza are Japanese thugs, who, in their most romanticized form, are latter-day samurai with a touch of Robin Hood thrown in. As a group, they are comparable to the Mafia, with warring factions, overlords, a boss of bosses and a formal code of behavior.\\"The Yakuza\\" is a movie about obligation—of American to American, of Japanese to American and of American to Japanese. It is also, in keeping with its genre, a movie of bloody gunplay and swordplay, of death and dismemberment unreeled with such momentum that the expectant and horrified mind's eye is sent hurtling repeatedly past the audacious brinksmanship of the editing into unseen but imagined freshets of gore.Out of a sense of obligation, Harry Kilmer (Robert Mitchum) agrees to help and old friend, George Tanner (Brian Keith), whose daughter has been kidnapped by a yakuza boss who believes that Keith has cheated him on a gun deal. To accomplish his undertaking, Mitchum is compelled to enlist the aid of Tanaka Ken played by Takakura Ken), a former yakuza and a moral relic who is obligated to Mitchum despite long-standing enmity.What follows is predictably combative, reaching a breathtakingly tense climax as Takakura, armed with a sword and backed by a gun-toting Mitchum, takes on a swarm of adversaries.Although admirable for its understated contrast of hoary ritual with modern trappings, \\"The Yakuza,\\" written by Paul Schrader and Robert Towne (\\"Chinatown\\") and with Sydney Pollack (\\"The Way We Were\\") as producer-director, is also didactic. It is slowed by the need to instruct its audience in the way of the yakuza; it is marred in its early exposition by some impenetrable Japanese-accented English; it is burdened by the attenuation of an unexciting love interest (which Mitchum's character freely admits being too old for); and a couple of formidably important revelations are simply dropped in, as though no one had the time to plot them properly.To some extent this movie pays the penalty for breaking ground with a new audience.But its merits as an action film strongly dosed with exotic culture and subculture are offset by obvious flaws. Neither fans of Almond Joy nor of nori maki are likely to be wholly satisfied by \\"The Yakuza,\\" but those who don't mind sampling both won't go away famished.

Check windowsills for drafts and remove house plants if the window seal is not tight.   Prairie Gentian     Q.    I grew up in Texas and became familiar with a wildflower that we used to call the prairie gentian. Last week I saw what looked like this flower growing in a pot. Was it the same thing? Can you help? And most important, can I grow it in the garden? Mrs. D.K., Washington.     A.  It is probably the same plant. The prairie gentian (Eustoma grandiflorum) is a native plant of the Southwest that has caught the fancy of many hybridizers. It is now available in a double form and is often sold both as a cut flower or as a pot plant. It is also called lisianthus. The newest hybrid to appear on the market is Hallelujah, a pink and purple bicolor. Eustoma is considered a half-hardy perennial in areas south of Washington. Otherwise, it should be grown as an annual as it will not survive northern winters. Radicchio     Q.    Where can I find seed of the red lettuce called radicchio. I would like to try to grow it because buying it is getting too expensive. W.T., Moline, Ill.     A.  Radicchio is not a lettuce, but related to chicory and this is where it is listed in most of the seed catalogues. In Italy chicories are called radicchio. This is a cool-season crop and many gardeners have best luck starting the seed in a coldframe in the fall and transplanting it to the garden in late spring. If the plants are cut back in late summer, they will resprout and form the tasty red-heads so noted for salads.

I can't seem to grow button fern. My plant was faithfully misted every day, the soil was kept moist and it was on a tray of wet pebbles I have in a north window. It died. This was my third try with this delightful fern. What am I doing wrong? Mrs. A.L.D., Manhattan.     A. The button fern is overwatered and kept too wet. Unlike most ferns, this particular one doesn't even look like a fern. It has small rounded leaves that do suggest buttons and it is one of the terrestrial Pellaeas, best grown on the somewhat dry side. Allow the top of the potting medium to become dry before adding water and stop misting. Humidity supplied by the wet pebbles should be adequate. Also, strong winter sunlight should be avoided; a north window is ideal for winter and semi-shade in the summer. More on Hardy Fuchsia     I read with considerable interest the discussion of hardy fuchsias on Nov. 18, which told about seeing the species Fuchsia magellanica growing in Ireland. Here in Rochester, N.Y. I have grown four fuchsias: F. exoniensis and three cultivars of F. magellanica: F.M. Variegata, Maiden's Blush and Senorita. This is my fifth season with them. The plants require shade, flower from spring until frost and have exceeded my expectations. I first saw them at the Thurston Lava Tube on the island of Hawaii where they were cascading from 15 to 20 feet down the side of a rock formation. One growing tip: mulch the plants heavily in late fall and carefully remove the mulch when safe in April or earlier, depending on the weather. B.S. Rochester, N.Y.

I read somewhere that certain annuals could be planted on snow and the seed would filter down into the soil as the snow melted and germinate in spring. Is this true? If so, what seeds respond this way? Mrs. T.T.G., Melrose, Mass.   A. Yes, it is true. Among the easiest hardy annuals to sow on snow are larkspur, sweet peas, Shirley poppies and bachelor's buttons. They can be sown now on top of snow or open ground now (or in fall) since the seed is hardy. In many garden situations, this type of seeding is recommended since these flowers usually succumb in summer heat, if they do not have an early start. Petit Pois     Q. Is there a seed source for those delicious petit pois or do we just grow regular peas and pick them young? Dr. P.P., Suffern, N.Y.   A. The sweet succulent petis pois is a particular cultivar. The pea pods are small, about three inches long and the peas are small, succulent and sweet. Pea seed should be planted early as soon as the soil can be worked.

We are moving to North Carolina in March and would like to take our beautiful peonies with us. But friends who are good gardeners tell us not to try. What do you think? Mrs. I.F., Manhasset, N.Y.   A. Don't try. Ideally peonies are planted in the fall months because this perennial is a heavy feeder and needs a well-established root system to flourish. Once planted well, peonies seldom need dividing or transplanting. In light of these facts, it would be wiser to buy new peony roots in late summer and plant them in the new garden. The bed where the peonies are to be grown can be prepared in advance this summer.   Q. I have saved several cones from a full-grown Cedrus atlantica glauca, the Atlas cedar. I would like to know how to make the seeds germinate? P.T.S., Wayne, Pa.   A. It may be too late as the seed should be sown promptly, as soon as it is ripe. If the cones remained in a warm room too long, the seed is probably dried out and not viable. This conifer seed also needs stratification, that is a cold period of about 14 to 16 weeks. For this reason, many propagators sow the seed in flats and place the flats outside and protect the top with rodent-proof screening. The planting medium usually freezes and thaws several times. This natural weathering spurs germination in the spring. More on Climbing Rose     On Jan. 13, Mrs. G.F. McH., a Manhattan gardener, asked where she could buy a gloriously fragrant old-fasioned climbing rose, Dr. W. Van Fleet. The answer referred her to its replacement New Dawn and stated that the older rose was rarely propagated these days.

The city is also home to a legion of Gepettos who passionately construct witches, lost little boys, wizards and barbarous he-men. Here is a survey of some of the puppet companies and theaters that offer shows regularly. All suggest that children 3 years old and up can attend. Strollers are stashed easily, and at the end of every show, the audience meets the puppets or can be taken backstage. No refreshments are served, nor are there intermissions, though a trip to the restroom between scenes is all right. Every show also requires reservations as many as three days ahead. 'Jack and the Beanstalk' The Puppetworks 338 Sixth Avenue (at Fourth Street) Park Slope section Brooklyn (718) 965-3391 Through Feb. 24    In a former storefront in Park Slope, the Puppetworks company, founded in 1938 and directed now by the puppeteer Nicolas Coppola, puts on a thoughtful and lively rendition of \\"Jack and the Beanstalk.\\" Jack, as always, reduces the giant Blunderbore to pathetic-bully status by the end of the 50-minute show. The puppets are nimble-footed and move gracefully","excerpt":"the Coppola script is imaginatively explored with comedy and touching details. When Blunderbore hiccups, thunder rolls, and when Petunia the cow is nervous, her tail jerks up and down. The company solves the gargantuan problem of casting a giant by using a live actor, whose meaty legs and torso fill much of the stage, yet he manages to fit right in. Children and adults can sit on benches or on mats on the floor in this cozy theater, which is devoted solely to puppets. Strung along a wall are the company's other marionettes, including the beautiful Dorothy from \\"The Wizard of Oz.\\" Performances are on Saturdays and Sundays at 12:30 P.M., with an additional show on Sundays at 3 P.M. An extra performance will be given this Monday at 12:30 P.M. Admission is $5 for adults and $4 for children. Starting on March 2, \\"The Tortoise and the Hare\\" and other Aesop's fables will begin performances, through April 28. 'Franklin the Wizard' The Puppet Company 31 Union Square West, at 16th Street, Loft 2B Manhattan (212) 741-1646 Through April 21    Al E. Gator, a purple-vested reptile, is the master of ceremonies of this very smart and ambitious marionette show. Arranged by Susan and Steven Widerman, sister and brother puppeteers, the hourlong musical \\"Franklin the Wizard\\" and the accompanying \\"Marionette Revue\\" give this talented team a chance to show how seriously they take their craft. In \\"Franklin,\\" written by the Widermans, a sweet boy, a wizard with bushy whiskers and a limber dragon embattle a one-eyed rock -- Nefarious Teufel -- his slave, and a flying evil eye. Afterward, the revue presents the kicking Clockettes from Clockafeller Center; Rocket, a silky-smooth roller skater, and Mona, a weary torch singer whose voluptuous neckline is downright plunging. Mr. Widerman manipulates the last two puppets in front of the audience, adeptly moving the marionettes as if they were agile yoga instructors. Admission to the programs, Sunday at noon, 2 and 3:30 P.M., is $5. A coat check is available. Puppet Playhouse Mazur Theater at Asphalt Green 555 East 90th Street Manhattan (212) 879-3316 or 369-8890 Through May 19    Leonard Suib, a man with an elfin twinkle, has been director of this playhouse for 13 years. And though the 91-seat theater presents magicians, storytellers and dancers, puppets traipse on the stage every weekend for the most part. Tomorrow and Sunday, the Perry Alley Theater, a husband-and-wife troupe from New Hampshire, will present \\"Really Really Terribly Old Stories,\\" four international folk tales dramatized by hand puppets and commented upon by Anansi, a spider puppet who has crawled all over the world. The 45-minute performances are at 10:30 A.M. and noon and cost $3.50. It is wise to arrive early to avoid scrambling for the more comfortable seats. A vending machine in the lobby dispenses soda at 75 cents a can. 'The Magic Flute' Swedish Cottage Marionette Theater Central Park Central Park West and 81st Street entrance (212) 988-9093 Through May 25    If Lincoln Center had a rustic home for puppets, it would be in this alpine cottage amid the trees and flora, on the left side of the park's main road after you walk in at 81st Street. The production, directed by Nicolas Coppola, is professional, with handsome movable sets on a broad stage, smooth pacing, surefooted sound and lighting systems and big, wooden string puppets whose costumes, particularly the Queen of the World of Night's lilac gown, would make the designer Balenciaga blush. The only problem: \\"The Magic Flute\\" is a mature story that 3-year-olds, though utterly transfixed by the variety and real-life nature of the puppets, may not follow very well. But for one hour at least, the children step into a floating fantasy of Mozart music and drama that soars from one short scene to the next. Admission is $3; shows are at noon and 3 P.M. on Saturdays. 'Hansel and Gretel,' 'Puff the Magic Dragon' Papageno Puppet Theater 173 West 81st Street Manhattan (212) 874-3297 Through April 28    In this homey studio-apartment theater, the lyric soprano Susan Delery Whedon is the artistic director, puppeteer and voice behind the shows. \\"Puff the Magic Dragon\\" is a 40-minute program in which a mermaid and Puff become emphatic by popping into arias; otherwise, the dragon is a quiet hand puppet not inclined to breathe much fire. Ms. Whedon makes the elaborate and intricate rod puppets herself, an endeavor she took up as a girl. The theater betrays her fondness for whimsy: the ceiling is a cloudy blue sky, gold lame curtains cover the windows, the radiator is silver, and a cuckoo clock perches on the wall. \\"Puff\\" is performed at noon and 2 P.M. and \\"Hansel and Gretel\\" at 1 P.M., Saturdays and Sundays. Admission is $5.

A private backyard garden is large enough for entertaining. A wooden staircase curls up through the house, past curved niches, toward a dainty oval skylight. But the pièce de résistance is a light-filled room on the top floor with a sloped glass roof. It adds a touch of modernity to the house's classic charms and would make an ideal studio or conservatory. It is not, however, the only sunny room. Even on an overcast day the house seems bright thanks to its generously sized windows and high ceilings.

The renovated kitchen has granite countertops and a washer-dryer. There is sufficient storage space, thanks to closets in the foyer and both bedrooms, including a walk-in closet in the master. The building, which allows pets, has many amenities, including 24-hour doormen, a roof deck, a windowed health club, a terraced party room, a laundry room and a children's play room.

Mr. Auchincloss invents a plausible and dramatic personal life for Guy and presents him as the symbol of a dying ruling class, arrogantly unrepentant about helping to bring it down: ''To keep up the position that the world expected of me, I borrowed the funds of that world. In a way, I still think it owed them to me.''

For traditional New York glamour, the Rainbow complex on the 65th floor of the General Electric Building is hard to beat. Recent movies like \\"The Prince of Tides\\" and \\"Six Degrees of Separation,\\" which have scenes set in the Rainbow Room, have only added to its mystique. For those with the resources, it offers three different dinner-with-entertainment choices. In all three locations, the events begin at 9 P.M. At the Rainbow Room, Tommy Tune, an entertainer whose exuberance and versatility make him the one-man equivalent of an old-time movie musical (preferrably starring Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers), is performing his solo cabaret act. There will be dancing to the Rainbow Room Orchestra. Black tie is required, and the price is $375 a guest, including dinner, dancing and the show. Rainbow and Stars, the cabaret around the corner, will have a performance of \\"The Leonard Bernstein Revue: A Helluva Town,\\" the latest and one of the strongest in its series of shows saluting Broadway composers. The program includes most of Bernstein's best-known theater songs performed by singers -- Lauren Mitchell, J. Mark McVey, Patrick Quinn and Ruth Williamson -- who lend them an appropriately semi-operatic grandeur. Dress is black tie, and the price is $325 a person, including dinner, dancing and the show.

Ann Hampton Callaway's rich, rangy alto is arguably the most the beautiful voice in New York City's cabaret world. It is especially well suited to traditional pop ballads like \\"How Deep Is the Ocean\\" and \\"My Foolish Heart,\\" which she imbues with an almost sobbing intensity. New Year's Eve shows are at 9 and 11:30 P.M. There is a $45 music charge and a $30 minimum, and a $50 prix fixe menu. A la carte selections are also available.

Can I Charge It?     If the Brooklyn Bridge really were for sale, there'd be no shortage of buyers -- and they wouldn't ask plodding questions about cash flow or traffic flow. They'd say, \\"Wow! I'd own the Brooklyn Bridge!\\" It's called the \\"trophy property\\" syndrome, seen everywhere from Donald Trump's buying the Plaza to a Japanese company's buying Rockefeller Center. That latter purchase did not turn out too well: when Mitsubishi Estate bought control from the Rockefeller family in 1989, it took on a $1.3 billion mortgage. It knew rents wouldn't be enough, but assumed that when office leases expired last year, it could jack rents way up. Guess what: rents are down, the losses will get worse and the Japanese might default and walk away, as if the noble complex were some termite-ridden shack. Maybe it can wring some deal from the lenders. Denny's Starts to Clean Up Its Act    Even in a society bedeviled by a lingering racism, Denny's stood out. For years blacks' complaints piled up -- of being refused service or asked to pay in advance -- to the point that bias seemed institutional. In May Denny's got the bill, agreeing to pay $54 million to settle thousands of lawsuits. And later it went a step further in its attempt to wipe this smudge from its name, announcing that a black-owned company would buy as many as 47 Denny's restaurants. How long will it be until blacks, spying a Denny's, don't see red? That could take a while. As the Hafts' World Turns: A Score Card    Whenever the news got too solemn last year, you could always count on the Haft family to provide a bit of soap opera buzz. In an all-American rags-to-riches-to-ranting story, Herbert and Gloria Haft built their Dart Group empire from a single drugstore, but riches couldn't buy family peace. These days, they always seem to be suing one another -- father vs. son, husband vs. wife -- and no blood tie proves binding. In May it was Herbert teaming up with his son Ronald against Herbert's ex-wife, Gloria, and their eldest son, Robert. Herbert and Ronald won that one, retaining control. But by September that alliance had collapsed, too, as Ronald tried to oust his father -- a move made more difficult because he needed other family members to back him, and he was not exactly in their good graces. Soon Ronald sued the company, and Herbert sued Ronald. Then, presumably, they all met for a cuddly Thanksgiving dinner (perhaps coming to blows over that last piece of pie). A Simple Pleasure, Made Complicated    Ah, how complicated life has become, even in a place designed expressly to simplify life -- McDonald's. It used to be blissfully simple: the coffee hot, the drinker sitting and sipping. But now everyone's hither and yon, perching take-out coffee in mid-dash. And spilling it. And suing someone. So it was that in August an Albuquerque, N.M., jury awarded $2.9 million to an 81-year-old woman burned by McDonald's coffee she spilled in her lap. McDonald's had arrived at the ideal coffee temperature -- 180 degrees. But the jury decided that that was too hot -- that McDonald's knew it was playing with fire. Then the experts emerged -- showing that fast-food drinks ranged from 154 to 184 degrees, with 154 pegged as \\"sippable.\\" To sort this out, sit down and have some lukewarm coffee. Some Heavy Huffing and Puffing    Smoking, if not smoke, was much in the air last year. In New York the City Council faced heavy-duty lobbying on an anti-smoking bill, with Philip Morris hinting that it might leave the city","excerpt":"the Council gave some ground but still passed a tough bill. Lawsuits against tobacco companies stepped up a notch in scope -- as typified by Mississippi's suing to recover the costs of smoking-related illnesses. And flight attendants got the go-ahead to file a class-action suit, the first to zero in on second-hand smoke. But the most vivid image was of top tobacco executives on Capitol Hill -- staring at a placard that read \\"One American dies every 80 seconds from tobacco use\\" -- and testifying, to a man, that smoking is not addictive. '94? What Was I Doing in '94?     If John Sculley had a \\"delete\\" key for his resume, he'd surely wipe out 1994.

Since these seven, beginning with the magnificent \\"Life of O'Haru,\\" all date from the few years before Mizoguchi's death in 1956, I suppose a significant step backward has been taken with the premiere of \\"Utamaro and His Five Women,\\" which was made in 1946 and which opened yesterday at the New Yorker Theater.The year 1946 is important because postwar difficulties explain some minor flaws in the film's technical quality, and because the story created major difficulties with the American occupation authorities, who were not happy at seeing any Japanese historical subject matter. However, Mizoguchi's theme is profoundly egalitarian, and his story from the life of Kitagawa Utamaro (1753-1806), an artist famous for his life-like depictions of beautiful women, is in one sense a celebration of human freedom that goes beyond even the freedom of a popular art.In general, the film moves from constraint to freedom, from the painfully gorgeous procession of court ladies against a background of blossoming cherry trees with which it opens (\\"Like a Harunobu painting!\\" exclaims a passer-by, thus identifying the style that Utamaro helped suppiant) to the veritable cascade of prints inspired by a single tragic passion with which it ends.But this movement is by no means simple. For the freedom of Utamaro the artist (Minnosuke Bando) is paralleled and in a sense surpassed by the greater freedom of his favorite model","excerpt":"the courtesan Okita (Kinuyo Tanaka), whose disordered life—she ultimately kills an unfaithful lover—has its own pathetic and wasteful grandeur.Yet Okita is wrong when she hopes to possess her lover rather than to rest content with some moments of his love. And Utamaro is right because he loves no one woman, nor all women, nor even the refinement of his art, but rather the vitality of the image that is always in movement, always passing out of view. Once he tries to create a real flesh-and-blood painting, a cartoon to be tattooed on the back of a beautiful courtesan. But the girl runs away, a love flight, taking her tattoo with her—the flesh-and-blood painting wholly subservient to the demands of actual flesh and blood.One could schematize \\"Utamaro and His Five Women\\" on a scale of relative freedom of will and desire. Such a scheme would be complex (there are five representative women, and several more men) and useful, for the film is, among other things, the exercise of an exceptionally active and intricate intelligence.But the beauty of Mizoguchi's filmmaking is even more striking—and not, of course, separable from the beauty of his conception. His subdued performances, his eye-level camera (in contrast with the straining for unusual perspective typical of so much Japanese moviemaking) photographing into a depth of field that is virtually a test of vision for the audience—everything contributes to a reasonable balance that evokes a rich classicism. It is a classicism of open awareness, and it values every romantic impulse that it chooses not to follow, preferring instead to sttay with what it understands to be the sustaining rhythms of the world.

JOSE (EL CANARIO) ALBERTO, Copacabana, 617 West 57th Street, Clinton, (212) 582-2672. He's called El Canario because he whistles, pretending to play the flute. That's fine, but he's an astute band leader whose group is Celia Cruz's orchestra of choice, and he can dip into the Machito band's repertory. He sings just fine, too. The show tonight starts at 11","excerpt":"the cover is $10 for women and $15 for men (Peter Watrous).    * ALESSANDRA BELLONI AND GLEN VELEZ, Cathedral of St. John the Divine, 1071 Amsterdam Avenue, at West 112th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 662-2133. Alessandra Belloni and Glen Velez are two virtuosos of a rudimentary instrument capable of astonishing subtlety: the frame drum, a family of instruments that includes the tambourine. Mr. Velez, best known for playing with the Paul Winter Consort, is a master of complex rhythms and globe-spanning styles. Ms. Belloni, who is also a singer, has spent years researching the songs, dances and ritual chants of southern Italy. At this concert, called ''Rhythm Is the Cure,'' the duo will play trance music from Puglia, chants and drumming for the Black Madonna and some ever useful chants against the evil eye, incorporating both traditional and international approaches. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30; admission is $15, $10 for students and senior citizens (Jon Pareles).    * VIC CHESNUTT AND LAMBCHOP, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, at the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111. Vic Chesnutt has the scratchy voice of a young codger, an ear for modestly inspirational tunes and an eye for the homely, off-kilter detail. Working with Lambchop, a 14-member band, on his new album, ''The Salesman and Bernadette'' (Capricorn), and on Lambchop's album ''What Another Man Spills'' (Merge), has opened up his songs, making his private allusions seem more social. Tomorrow night at 9; Lambchop will play an opening set and then back up Mr. Chesnutt. Tickets are $15 (Pareles).    SHEMEKIA COPELAND, at Chicago Blues, 73 Eighth Avenue, below 14th Street, West Village, (212) 924-9755. Shemekia Copeland got an early start on the blues circuit touring with her father, Johnny Copeland, who died last year. With a gutsy but girlish voice, like Etta James or Bonnie Raitt, she sings about men and their many flaws, from indifference to infidelity, and she sounds as if she'll get what she wants sooner or later. She recently released her first album, ''Turn the Heat Up'' (Alligator). Sets tomorrow night at 9:30, 11 and 12:30; admission is $15 (Pareles).    * CARL COX, Twilo, 530 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (212) 462-9422 or (212) 268-1600. The English disk jockey Carl Cox packs information into his sets. Working on three turntables, he juggles bits and pieces of songs in ways that are both dizzyingly virtuosic and decidedly propulsive, maintaining an unswerving beat while the textures constantly shift. Tonight at about 1 A.M.; admission is $25 (Pareles).    DU-TELS, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7503. Together, Gary Lucas and Peter Stampfel have impressive credentials -- the former used to play with Captain Beefheart, the latter with the Holy Modal Rounders. But when they appear as a duo, they're just a couple of mad song collectors, performing hymns, folk songs, television themes and anything else that you don't expect. They're both funny; Mr. Stampfel, in particular, with his blurted witticisms and funny old-man's voice, can tell jokes that you won't forget. Sets are on Sunday at 8 and 9 P.M.; admission is $10 (Ben Ratliff).    * KURT ELLING QUARTET/CHARLIE HUNTER-LEON PARKER DUO, Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080. As part of Blue Note Records' commandeering of the city's jazz clubs through the month of January, this double bill presents a few of jazz's more interesting oddballs. Mr. Elling, a youngish singer, tends to imitate a horn, sometimes a specific one: he'll put lyrics to a well-turned old solo by Dexter Gordon or Wayne Shorter. At other times, he's flirting with beat literature, delivering run-on stream-of-consciousness raps that undulate with the music. The guitarist Charlie Hunter generally plays breezy funk and soul-influenced jazz, keeping the bass-lines bubbling while he simultaneously improvises melodically on his eight-string. Some of his albums have been better for the dance floor than a jazz club. But this duet project with the drummer Leon Parker, a hard-slapping minimalist, will probably focus him, taking away some of the groovy pull of his regular bands; it may put him in a different place than he's used to. Double-bill sets tonight and tomorrow are at 9 and 11:30 P.M.; admission is $20; $10 minimum (Ratliff).    MARTIN HAYES AND DENNIS CAHILL and ANAM, Fez, 380 Lafayette Street, at Great Jones Street, East Village, (212) 533-2680. Celtic tradition takes some individual turns with this double bill. The fiddler Martin Hayes and the guitarist Dennis Cahill turn Irish tunes into gentle, virtuosic fantasias that drift into realms close to classical music and jazz. Anam, from Edinburgh, plays music from Ireland, Scotland and England; it recently added a singer, Fiona Mackenzie, to its lineup. Tomorrow at 8:30 P.M. and Monday at 7:30 P.M.; admission is $15 (Pareles).    * BRUCE HENDERSON CHARITY BALL, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, at the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111. How much songwriting talent is there on the New York City club circuit? This concert has more than a dozen songwriters aiming for that perfect distillation of incident, insight and memorable tune. The lineup includes Marshall Crenshaw, Amy Rigby, Jules Shear, Freedy Johnston, Dan Zanes, Willie Nile, Five Chinese Brothers and the duo of G. E. Smith and Taylor Barton. If they share anything, it's a fondness for pre-1970's styles from folk-rock and country-rock to the Beatles and Buddy Holly. Tonight at 8; admission is $20 (Pareles).    FRED HERSCH TRIO, Iridium, 44 West 63rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 582-2121. Mr. Hersch doesn't often play his standards-rich jazz in quartets or quintets anymore, because he doesn't need the extra front-line voices: his harmonies are so shrewdly ingenious that he can sound like two or three pianists at once.  Sets through Sunday are at 8:30 and 10:30 P.M.; cover is $25; $10 food and drink minimum (Ratliff).    DAVE HOLLAND QUINTET/JIMMY COBB AND COBB'S MOB, Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080. Mr. Holland, a first-call bassist who started an illustrious career playing with Miles Davis, has recently formed a series of bands that maintain a deep groove and hum at the center; this one includes the saxophonist Chris Potter, whose woolly improvisations can be brilliant. Jimmy Cobb, a drummer with Cannonball Adderly, Miles Davis and countless other bands as jazz turned into the 1960's, plays with a commanding, no-nonsense authority, and leads a worthwhile band, all veterans of New York's small jazz clubs. On Sunday with a double bill at 9 P.M.; Mr. Cobb's group plays alone at 11 P.M. Admission is $20, with a $10 minimum at tables (Ratliff).    * FREEDY JOHNSTON, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703. Freedy Johnston's finely turned folk-rock songs have carefully balanced melodies that he sings in a winsome tenor. But for all their classic symmetry, they're the confessions of some desperate, unsavory and unbalanced characters. He shares the bill tomorrow night with David Poe, another specialist in tuneful portrayals of antisocial types. Tonight at 10 with Jenny Mae opening; tomorrow at 10 P.M. with Mr. Poe. Admission is $10 (Pareles).    WAYNE KRAMER, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703. Back in the 1960's, Wayne Kramer was the guitar powerhouse of the MC5, Detroit's incendiary psychedelic-punk-political band. He hasn't given up on snaky leads or sinewy power chords. Sunday at 9 P.M., with the Heartdrops opening; admission is $8 (Pareles).    CHRISTINE LAVIN, Bottom Line, 15 West Fourth Street, at Mercer Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 228-7880. Christine Lavin's songs are about small pleasures like cold pizza for breakfast, major annoyances like sensitive New Age guys and other clueless men and, between the wry observations, some songs of unabashed tenderness. Sets tomorrow at 7:30 and 10:30 P.M.; admission is $17.50 (Pareles).    * BRAD MEHLDAU TRIO, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037. This jazz pianist's long-standing trio makes dramatic music that leaps out of the subconscious; it can play with your feelings, too, giving you a floating sensation when they layer different tempos. Mr. Mehldau cares deeply about coming up with fresh improvisations, and he's been one of the most important arrivals of the last 10 years. Sets through Sunday are at 9:30 and 11:30 P.M., with a 1 A.M. set tonight and tomorrow; admission is $15, with a $10 minimum (Ratliff).    THURSTON MOORE AND GUESTS, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006. Mr. Moore, the singer and guitarist from Sonic Youth, associates with just about everybody who ever played an atonal power chord (25 more of his studio collaborations appear on a recent CD, ''Root''). Here he presents a two-night stand called ''New Year's Noise.'' Tonight he begins with a solo acoustic guitar set, which is followed by sets from the trio Foot; from an electroacoustic trio made up of Kim Gordon, Ikue Mori, and DJ Olive, and from solo electronics from Dean Roberts. Tomorrow night, in order: a free-jazz trio of Mr. Moore, the saxophonist Jon Voigt and drummer Laurence Cook; the guitarist Loren Mazzacane Connors, performing with Matt Heyner, and the abstract-improv outfit Test. Tickets are $8 each night, and music starts at 9 P.M. (Ratliff).    PUERTO RICAN POWER, Copacabana, 617 West 57th Street, Clinton, (212) 582-2672. A swinging little working salsa band from the island, led by Luisito Ayala. The singer Tito Rojas came from the band; it will be joined by the merengue group Victor Roque and the Gran Manzana. Tomorrow at 10 P.M.; Sunday at 6 P.M.; the cover tomorrow after 11 P.M. is $15 for women and $20 for men. On Sunday, the cover after 8 P.M. is $5 for women and $10 for men. The minimum is $20 (Watrous).    RENEE ROSNES, Sweet Basil, 88 Seventh Avenue South, above Bleecker Street, West Village, (212) 242-1785. Ms. Rosnes, a pianist with a nice touch and good sense of narrative in her solos, brings together a searching adventurous mainstream group. Chris Potter is on saxophone, Scott Colley on bass and Billy Drummond on drums; the group covers lots of ground. Sets through Sunday are at 9 and 11 P.M. and 12:30 A.M., with no third set on Sunday; there is a $20 cover and a $10 minimum; on Sunday, there is a $17.50 cover and a $10 minimum (Watrous).    HILTON RUIZ, Zinno's, 126 West 13th Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 924-5182. The pianist has constructed an odd little group with Lew Soloff on trumpet and Lisle Atkinson on bass. Mr. Ruiz is percussive and dynamic, and there's a good chance that a drummer won't be missed at all. And Mr. Soloff is one of the more imposing trumpeters in jazz. Sets tonight and tomorrow night are at at 8 and 10, continuing until midnight; the cover is $16 and the minimum is $15 (Watrous).    TABOU COMBO, S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, SoHo, (212) 243-4940. Tabou Combo, one of the great Caribbean bands, is the king of the Haitian dance style called compa. The group put the style together in parts: springy, syncopated guitar figures, a percussion section, a horn section, a chorus plus a lead singer. It's a pile of riffs that all seem to float. The band reaches its boil slowly, but when it gets there it's easy to forget one's surroundings and give in to the music. Shows tonight are at 11 and 1 A.M.; there is a $15 cover (Watrous).

She howls about modern life, including plagues and more, and even sings standards. And she's very funny, an avant-gardist in full control of her faculties.

Young Saxophonist    Steve Wilson, Smalls, 183 West 10th Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 929-7565. Among musicians, Steve Wilson, an alto saxophonist, is considered one of the best of the young jazz improvisers. Every time he plays, he has seemingly improved, making brevity and melody his esthetic. He'll be sharing the front line with another talked-about musician, the profoundly laid-back tenor saxophonist Mark Turner. They will be backed by a rhythm section that includes the pianist Mercedes Rossy, the bassist Dwayne Burno and the drummer Billy Drummond.

THE practice of trail-driving herds of beef cattle over long distances from ranch to railhead flourished for just a moment after the Civil War and before the widespread use of barbed wire. It was the tiniest fraction of our national experience and did not directly involve more than a few thousand people.

Even today, it seems to be everywhere: in clothing, in advertising, in political rhetoric.

(Anchor, $14.) Tracing the human fascination with robotics to the sophisticated mechanical toys of the Enlightenment, the author conjures a menagerie of bizarre and quixotic automatons, including chess-playing machines, artificial defecating ducks and Thomas Edison's doomed venture to mass-produce talking dolls. Last year our reviewer, Miranda Seymour, called this ''a lively, elegant and surprising book, packed with curious details and enticing anecdotes.''    HALF IN LOVE: Stories, by Maile Meloy. (Scribner, $12.) No one expects an easy life in this first collection of short fiction, mostly set in the author's native Montana. The tales evoke a West of horse tracks, cowboy brawls, failed oil wells and brides who choose their wedding dress to hide branding-iron scars, a world where even young people feel their choices limited by economics and losing habits. ''At its best, 'Half in Love' offers up both plain speaking and mystery, subtlety and shock,'' Jean Thompson wrote here in 2002.    THE GATEKEEPER: A Memoir, by Terry Eagleton. (St. Martin's Griffin, $12.95.) An acclaimed literary theorist, prolific writer and Marxist scholar tells of his coming-of-age as a member of the Irish Catholic working class in England's industrial northwest and his education at Cambridge and beyond. His ''hilarious, devastating little book'' is ''an apologia pro vita sua from one of Britain's most unapologetic old New Left thinkers'' as well as ''a hymn to the enduring power and pleasure of intellectual thought,'' Jenny Turner said in the Book Review last year.    YOU SHALL KNOW OUR VELOCITY! by Dave Eggers. (Vintage, $14.) Eggers's first novel is a perpetual motion machine, setting its heroes, a pair of semi-slacker buddies named Will and Hand, on the run in such locales as Chicago, Dakar, Marrakesh and Riga, in a frantic effort to suck up life following the violent death of their best friend. Last year our reviewer, John Leonard, found this a ''lesser effort'' than the author's first book, ''A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius,'' but one that is nonetheless ''entirely honorable and ultimately persuasive'' and whose ''Frisbee sentences . . . sail, spin, hover, circle and come back to the reader like gifts of gravity and grace.''    THE LOBSTER Chronicles: Life on a Very Small Island, by Linda Greenlaw. (Hyperion, $13.95.) Greenlaw, familiar to readers as a swordfish boat captain in Sebastian Junger's best seller ''The Perfect Storm,'' describes her efforts to make a home off the coast of Maine, where she reconnects with her family and looks to find a mate. ''It's a lot of fun to read,'' Erica Sanders said here last year, and it also ''relates the lobster's rise from its beginnings as grub fit only for servants, orphans and prisoners","excerpt":"the creature's mating rituals; and her mother's recipe for lobster casserole.''    CENTURY'S SON, by Robert Boswell. (Picador, $14.) At the center of this novel of four generations are a Midwestern couple lost in a fog of recrimination and mourning following the suicide of their 12-year-old son. Rounding out the mix are their daughter, who becomes pregnant at 14 and raises her son in her parents' home even as she refuses to divulge the identity of the father, and her grandfather, a renowned Russian dissident who shows up one day. ''Boswell sets his vision of one family's painful, incomplete, unorthodox but still stirring return to life as an irremediably private matter,'' Jonathan Dee wrote here in 2002.    KING OF THE JEWS, by Leslie Epstein. (Handsel, $15.) This 1979 Holocaust novel focuses on the morally ambiguous politics of survival of a Judenrat, or council of Jewish officials, forced to collaborate with the Nazis in a Polish ghetto. The council's elder is a complex figure who is part charlatan, part mad dictator and part cunning politician. The result is a ''quietly controlled, eerily lucid'' tale and a ''lesson in what artistic restraint can do to help us imagine the dark places of our history,'' Robert Alter said here.    BETRAYAL: The Crisis in the Catholic Church, by the Investigative Staff of The Boston Globe. (Back Bay/Little, Brown, $14.95.) This book incorporates a decade's worth of reporting by The Globe on the abuse of children by Roman Catholic priests in Boston and the church's efforts to contain the scandal. The result is ''the fullest account to date of the egregious priestly and episcopal mistakes, sins and crimes that occurred at the epicenter of what almost immediately became a national crisis,'' R.

All of this is by way of noting a recent renewal of that hoary debate over whether there is any link between being very poor and committing crimes.

For this fine English-speaking edition of a notable French film is tragedy in the proper technical sense, and it represents an exalting experience. Superbly performed by Charles Boyer and directed by Nicolas Farkas with the reticence and the boiling imagination of an artist, \\"The Battle\\" pursues a fatal issue to a denouement which is noble, tragic and inevitable. The moment in which the Marquis Yorisaka, clad in the ceremonial garments of death, prepares to atone with the hara-kiri knife for his unforgivable offense, is foreordained long before it occurs. Yet the crisis is more brilliantly effective and more acutely touching than all the fortuitous happy endings of the cinema season.The sin of Yorisaka is as terrible and unavoidable as the sin of Orestes. It grows out of the nobility of the man and his tragic sense of honor. The director's triumph in \\"The Battle\\" is that he clarifies this fact so admirably, just as M. Boyer's is that he makes us believe in the qualities of character which force Yorisaka relentlessly to his doom. For Yorisaka, the Japanese gentleman, the nobleman, the loyal defender of his country, deliberately forces his wife to betray him in the arms of an infidel. He is the captain of a Japanese battleship which has just emerged the victor in a naval engagement. Although he is acclaimed as a hero, he knows that his victory was more the result of the enemy's frailties than of his own brilliance. Commander Fergan, the British naval attaché on his vessel, is to make a secret report of the engagement to the British Admiralty. If Yorisaka can discover what is in that report he will understand the flaws in the Japanese naval technique, and he will help his country to become the ruler of the Eastern waves.\\"The Battle\\" is the story of how he crushes his pride, his honor and his hatred of the Western infidel in order to secure the information which he feels his country needs. He forces his charming wife, against her own inclinations, to submit to Commander Fergan's amorous attentions, deliberately leaving the two alone in his house. He coldly forces her on, although she implores him to release her from a dangerous situation. Finally she falls in love with the foreigner. While Yorisaka is rifling the Englishman's rooms for a copy of the official report, he discovers the infidelity of his wife. With the aid of the stolen information, he becomes the hero of a great battle, during which the Englishman is killed. As the victorious fleet steams into Nagasaki to receive the homage of their countrymen, Yorisaka retires to his chambers and performs the ceremonial act of suicide which is his only atonement for his crime against himself and his wife.It is one of the most striking features of the photoplay that the tensely exciting qualities of the drama are keyed down to the Oriental convention of impassivity and rigidly repressed emotion. Charles Boyer's performance is extraordinarily moving and it gains in impact from his ability to convey the emotions of his torment while preserving an enigmatic exterior. The photography is expert and is probably the most skillful technically that has come out of France. Although M. Boyer dominates the photoplay and sums up in himself all of its tragic beauty, he has excellent assistance from Merle Oberon, who is both lovely and dramatically stirring as the wife, and from John Loder as the British attaché.This reporter discovers two minor objections. The battle scenes are so vigorous and thrilling that it seems unnecessary to incorporate the too-familiar newsreel scene of the sinking of the St. Stephen. The climactic hara-kiri episode, dramatized nakedly before the camera, is too cruel and direct in its approach. The suicide would have lost none of its force if it had been presented by the suaver method of indirection. But in every way \\"The Battle\\" is a screen drama of enormous cumulative power.

Bathed in the tangy candy colors of tropical fruit Starbursts, the movie follows the adventures of an aspiring band led by the ambitious, spiky-haired Freddy (Kick Gurry). The flabby, dimwit manager Bruno (the scene-stealing Russell Dykstra) wants to shove the group along the way, too.  Touchingly, Freddy's fantasy seems to be as out-of-touch as full-priced CD's and pre-recorded videocassettes, a notion he willingly admits. His best pal, Joe (Brett Stiller), professes to crave normality. But with a former rock-star dad, Kevin (Andy Anderson),  who still wears the poodle curls  and has a penchant for groupies with a taste for suicidal tendencies, Joe isn't fooling anyone.  The drummer, Lucy (Chris Sadrinna), gobbles his own homemade brew of pharmaceuticals and judges the results on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being a rapturous mixture of pleasure and pain he eventually experiences in a way that surprises even him. Tanya (Pia Miranda), the bassist, has the gaunt, dolorous manner of a sexy butch-pixie. Mr. Proyas, who often displays more technique than he knows what to do with, marries his compulsive exhibitionism to &quot;Garage&quot; in ways that suggest a visual exploration of pop culture wisecracking; this movie could be &quot;A Hard Day's Night&quot; as staged by the director Danny Boyle of &quot;Trainspotting.&quot; He gets the most gas out of &quot;Garage&quot; in set pieces that are departures from the pedestrian pursuit of stadium-filling popularity.

And the answer, we sadly discovered, was no more cheering than the one the passenger gets.Truly, this somewhat cleaned-up version of Mr. Steinbeck's checkered report on a bus trip taken in California by a driver and eight passengers wrestling with their souls is an unrelieved conglomeration of pseudo-dramatic fits and starts, quasi-arty direction and acting that is strictly for the road. A miserable lot of people are taken for a tormenting ride—and the audience that sits and beholds it is in for a rough passage, too.Let's look first at the bus driver. He is churning inside because his wife has irritated him this fitful morning. People kept knocking on the door. And the wife has a way of boozing. He is in a state to rebel.Then there's that crabbing married couple with a daughter who's looking for a guy—any guy, just so long as he'll shock Mama.

But the script, done by Ivan Moffat, is a snarl of paltry and patchy plots in which the characters switch horses, psychologically, almost as often as they pile on and off the bus. And the direction of Victor Vicas is so loaded with pretentions of \\"style\\"—crafty angles and reflections in mirrors, etc.—that it proves disturbing to the eye.As for the acting of all and sundry—Rick Jason as the driver of the bus, Joan Collins as his moody helpmate, Jayne Mansfield as the stag-party girl, Dan Dailey as the traveling salesman, and maybe a half-dozen more—it looks as if it is being delivered by a stock company that might be traveling on this bus.The film, in CinemaScope (noncolor), was produced by Charles Brackett for Twentieth Century-Fox.

Always in earnest, he can also be fiendishly playful, holding the crutches in front of his face and peering through them as if they form a fan. In every regard, they enlarge his opportunity for dastardy, and they serve as a twin scepter of office.    In performance, what could be considered simply an actor's choice - like a hat or a false nose - becomes a concept. Crutches define the character and the production. This is the most mobile and physically aggressive Richard within my memory; he is very much a man of action.

Lang Lang enjoys huge popularity with concertgoers and suffers the suspicions of critics and the cognoscenti. At his audience-wowing best in Chopin's Piano Concerto in E minor last night, he flamed and bounced for all his 23 years were worth","excerpt":"the cultural equivalent of sunglasses was needed to make one's way through all the glitz.

Although the Prince of Wales Museum was founded in 1906 and opened in 1921, its organization and its appearance place it firmly in an earlier era. There is neither dramatic lighting nor lengthy labeling (on occasion there is no labeling at all); but the observant visitor is offered a sample of some of the best sculpture and painting ever produced in India.   Because many American visitors arrive in Bombay, the museum can also serve as a concise introduction to some of the marvels ahead. The very style of the building, in fact, is an important part of the experience. A curious but highly successful blend of two apparently contradictory styles, the Indo-Saracenic and the Scottish Baronial, the exterior of the museum is as appealing as it is improbable. Bow windows and a neo-Gothic porte-cochere give way to arcades and a vast onion dome borrowed from the 17th-century Gol Gumbz in Bijapur. Brick, stone and faience tiles (an addition made in the last few years) continue the 19th-century tradition of polychrome architecture.

We wish the Continental no ill when we say we should have preferred to see it presented somewhere else, in some less arena-like theatre. The Continental is almost too vast a place for a pastoral. A small thing, like \\"To the Victor,\\" deserves a more intimate audience.Yet, perhaps there will be a bond between the screen and the audience, entwining them closely and inviting affection and respect. \\"To the Victor\\" deserves them both, for it is an affectionate film, simple as a shepherd's life, and it is an admirable film, gaited to the remarkably adept performance of Will Fyffe as the likable old curmudgeon, McAdam.

We are sure of the order of the former two, reasonably sure the bottle precedes Jeannie. And when a newcomer takes the farm next door, wins Jeannie, the cup and sheepdog supremacy, McAdam glowers and murmurs in almost indecipherable Scots and takes solace in his bottle. It gives him wit, it gives him malice, it gives him a harsh tongue and it gives him—at the last—a sly victory over all adversity. The newcomer has won the day, but Black Wull has left a sharp-toothed, dark-coated son and McAdam pets him for the deviltry that's his heritage.We found it a thoroughly delightful picture, true to its background and true to its author. We enjoyed Mr. Fyffe and John Loder and Margaret Lockwood and their neighbors and their dogs. We enjoyed particularly the field trials of the sheep dogs and the broad burrs of the shepherds and the incidental glimpses of moor and crag; and we enjoyed the brawl in the inn and McAdam's conduct of his own trial and Black Wull's acceptance of family responsibility by dropping a bone at the paws of Sally.

They are spread by handling an infected leaf, then handling the leaf of a healthy but susceptible plant. This often takes place during pruning or when taking cuttings. Other viruses are spread by insects, a sufficient reason to control such insects, even though their presence would not otherwise be damaging to the host plant. In some cases, viruses may be harbored by a host plant that is either a weed or, if cultivated, is not severely affected.

It is common knowledge that the dance division of the State University College at Purchase, N.Y., produces some of the best performers around, and that many of them may be seen without much trouble by dancegoers in Manhattan. But the students' annual spring concert, presented only in Westchester at the college's theater complex, is more difficult to get to.  And that is a pity. The performances can be eye opening when they feature revivals of familiar dances. The dancers are skilled and fresh, and perform without a trace of affectation.    This year's program, which will be repeated Thursday through Sunday at the college's Performing Arts Center (735 Anderson Hill Road, Purchase), opens with \\"Forest,\\" an exquisite modern dance piece choreographed by Robert Cohan, the director of the London Contemporary Dance Theater and a former Martha Graham principal. Bodies move through dim light in soft-colored leotards. The eager attack is Graham. The look of limpid suspension is Merce Cunningham.

Now Mr. Feld has created a sequel, ''Intermezzo No. 2,'' for his present company, the Feld Ballet.    Along with a revival, ''Impromptu,'' which is being danced by a guest artist this season, Karen Kain, ''Intermezzo No. 2'' shows Mr. Feld's special way with ballet's classical idiom - his firm knowledge of its possibilities and his unexpected exploration of those possibilities.   Like its predecessor, ''Intermezzo No. 2'' is set to piano music or intermezzos by Brahms. At the ballet's New York premiere Saturday night at the Joyce Theater (19th Street and Eighth Avenue), these were played with feeling by Peter Longiaru.

There's just no way to delight children with a feel-good version of this story.         But the happily-ever-after \\"Hunchback of Notre Dame\\" tries so hard that it approaches the absurd.

An attempt to pass glib judgment on \\"The First World War\\" would be the equivalent in impertinence of an attempt to evaluate the dramatic skill exhibited by a soldier dying on an open field under machine-gun fire. During the last two years there have been several compiled film histories of the World War which were quite as brutal and terrifying as editorial skill could make them. With the cool honesty befitting a man who left a leg on the battlefield, Laurence Stallings blends the product of many cameras into the astonishing work which he slyly calls \\"The First World War,\\" and in the process speaks the last word on the matter with all possible finality.Even after \\"Forgotten Men\\" and the other war anthologies which plundered the photographic archives of the nations, this material is possessed of an incredible fullness and scope. But it is Mr. Stallings who gives it form as a motion picture with his brilliant running commentary, which confers on it a relentless and startling effectiveness. Like the captions which distinguished his volume of the same name, the Stallings comments drip on this monstrous kaleidoscope of human imbecility with the subtle, dark and murderous bite of acid. Pedro de Cordoba, who speaks the lines, provides them with their full measure of withering irony.In eleven chapters \\"The First World War\\" describes the beginnings of the conflict, its irresistible spread like a disease over the civilized world, its history and personalities, and the blind emotionalism of its millions of actors. The film lacks the nice taste for horror which marked its predecessors. It avoids the fallacy of placing blame. As Mr. Stallings said in his introduction to the book: \\"There is no conclusion to it. * * * Here it is in the making, just as man made it, caught by the camera eye.\\"It begins a generation before 1914 and ends in these years of grace with the world's leaders exhorting the multitudes as of yore—a medley of newsreels imposed upon the scene of an American soldier and a German prisoner exchanging hats and shaking hands fraternally on the day of the Armistice. Most of the films have an unusual clarity and apparently have been freed in the laboratory of the streaky and yellowish quality of old motion pictures.A recital of Mr. Stallings's chapter divisions is, perhaps, the most effective way of summarizing a work which is enormous in its content. These are the chapters: (1) Preparations for the conflict. (2) The Balkan Wars of 1912, foreshadowing the greater war. (3) Ferdinand assassinated and the mad scramble of the nations to get in the fight. (4) War on the high seas","excerpt":"the Dardanelles, Jutland and the Adriatic. (5) War under the seas; Germany's restricted and then unlimited U-boat campaign. (6) War in the air. (7) America enters the fight. (8) Collapse of Russia; famine and revolution. (9) 1918—Foch as Generalissimo; preparations for the final offensive. (10) The big drive, following Germany's offensive against the Channel ports; Foch's counter attack on all fronts. (11) Armistice and after.From such a wealth of authentic historical documents, how shall illustrative scenes be selected? For pure brilliance of composition, award the palm to the unknown cameraman who photographed a French division advancing in close formation in the snow-covered Vosges Mountains, leaving irrelevant bodies spotting the clean snow as it moves up the ridge. For sheer sadistic horror, applaud the old but unforgetable scene of the Austrian flagship St. Stephen going down, the waters around it black with struggling men. For historical merit, perhaps the sustained chronicle of the Battle of Jutland. It is simpler to mark \\"The First World War\\" down as a memorable and infinitely important document which should be distributed in every civilized country. If any motion picture is assured of enduring life, this is the one.

Ideally, you want soft dirt or pea gravel, clear of glass shards and railroad spikes that could cause you instinctively, and fatally, to sit up. Today, at 37, I couldn't be threatened or baited enough to attempt that dive. But as a seventh grader struggling to make the cut in a tough Atlanta grammar school, all it took was a dare.\\n\\nI coasted through my first years of school as a fussed-over smart kid, the teacher's pet who finished his work first and then strutted around the room tutoring other students. By the seventh grade, I had more A's than friends. Even my old cronies, Dwayne and O.T., made it clear I'd never be one of the guys in junior high if I didn't dirty up my act. They challenged me to break the rules, and I did. The I-dare-you's escalated: shoplifting, sugaring teachers' gas tanks, dropping lighted matches into public mailboxes.

But beneath the small-town banalities of life in the United States at the turn of the century, we can hear the beat of a different, very dark story, one of frustration, rage and violent death. Eventually, the journal and the play itself become a journey of discovery.   As wife and mother, the Woman (Barbara Andres) has been a contradictory combination of overbearing maternal concern and terrible parental neglect. As her children die, one after another, and as her marriage stagnates, she is forced to confront the fearful fact of her own culpability.

It was the kind of balance that may be the goal of most festival programmers but is rarely achieved with such clean-cut variety as appeared in this program. Mr. Newman, who was a star trumpet player with Count Basie for many years, led a group that included two distinctive soloists - the pianist Roger Kellaway, who is of no period and no style except his own and is therefore particularly fascinating when he is dealing with such familiar material as the old pop song, ''Exactly Like You,'' or the blues, and the guitarist Ted Dunbar, whose mellow and individualistic attitude fit well with Mr. Kellaway.   Miss Carter also dealt with familiar material - ''Lover Man,'' ''Dearly Beloved'' - in highly personal terms. But her idiosyncrasies were established in her first song and became repetitious after that. Mr. Valentin, a flutist, was amplified over a boiling rhythm background in a way that became as predictable as Miss Carter's songs, except when he dismissed his accompanists to play stimulating solos on a variety of wooden flutes.

This film is overburdened with incidents and, although it succeeds in telling a story and pointing a moral, it does so in a long-winded and clumsy fashion.In the course of the proceedings one hears about prisoners in and out of jail, a girl who drinks too many cocktails, ex-convicts who apparently amuse themselves now and again by picking pockets, a romance between a rich man's daughter and a former felon's brother, a murder, a United States Senatorial investigation and several other matters.Fingers Partos, a former trainer of pugilists, on being released from prison, is eager to have his younger brother, Babe, steer clear of the seamy side of life. He wants Babe to join what he calls the \\"best people.\\" Soon afterward Partos wins favor with Masterson, a rich promoter and speculator, for whom the jailbird acts as trainer and masseur.One day Partos hears Masterson talking about government oil fields, seepage and stock promotion, and he promptly invests his savings in the deal and does very well. By that time Babe, through Partos's influence, has found a position in a broker's office, and it augurs well for Babe and the \\"best people.\\" Later the young man falls in love with Doris, Masterson's daughter, who on first being introduced is inclined to imbibe too freely. The romance causes the ex-convict to think that Babe is secure with the \\"best people.\\" But Masterson frowns upon the idea of his daughter marrying Partos's brother, even though the ex-convict is an excellent help in keeping him in good physical trim. The promoter goes about discouraging Doris's love affair in his own way—by giving a fake tip over the telephone so that Partos can hear, and then awaiting results. Partos invests his money in the stock mentioned by Masterson, and soon afterward learns that he has lost everything. Masterson admits that he had tricked Partos, who then proceeds to see how he can even up odds with Masterson. Fate leads him to a publisher who is exceedingly interested in Partos's story of the prelude to the oil-field scandal, and the ex-convict rather prides himself on being the champion of 120,000,000 people by going to Washington to testify.Masterson and his crew endeavor to prevent Partos from appearing before the Senate investigating committee, but, notwithstanding all manner of intimidation, he tells his tale and the big men with many dollars eventually find themselves doing time in small cells, about which Partos himself had learned enough to make him go straight.Robert Armstrong gives a vigorous portrait of the crude Partos.

Perhaps, I hoped, the years that stretched before me until my real life would get under way could be assimilated, like chapters in a textbook. From Seventeen, I moved on to Glamour, Mademoiselle, and then, as a sophomore in high school, I graduated to Vogue, in which the models weren't girls but women -- full-fledged citizens of cocktail parties and candlelit dinners for two. I scrutinized pictures of expensive clothes and pored over descriptions of some new mascara formula. That this information often turned out to be useless to a small-town teen-ager was immaterial to me","excerpt":"the day would come when I would have to choose an eyebrow pencil or buy a bra to wear under a strapless evening gown, and then I would be up to the task.   Those magazines were my initiation into the cult of femininity. Reading them, I felt part of a community that got together once a month for lessons in the art of self-presentation. These lessons proved to be both logical and capricious, reassuring and confusing. Eventually, I came to the conclusion that the love of a man must be even more crucial than I'd imagined, if so much time and effort went into acquiring it. Experience has obliged me to re-examine much of what I learned in those pages, and such elaborate strategies for attracting a man's interest and sustaining it now strike me as quaint and misguided, as if a passionate understanding between two people could be arrived at by means of a fetching hairdo and the right shoes. And yet, unlike algebra and most of the rest of what I was studying in school at the time, the fashion dogma of twenty-some years ago is engraved in my memory. As I dress for some special occasion, the axioms come back to mind, contradicting one another. No wonder I was bewildered.

Breezy, British and as comfy as a Cotswold cottage, \\"The Summons\\" brings back the out-of-shape, out-of-work sleuth Peter Diamond. It's been two years since this portly detective superintendent resigned from the Avon and Somerset police force on a matter of principle. Now the department wants him back. It seems John Mountjoy, a former academic with a history of assaulting women, a criminal Diamond put away for the murder of a Swedish reporter, has escaped from prison. He's holed up somewhere in Bath with the daughter of the assistant chief constable as his hostage, and insists on talking to the man who first snared him. Although Diamond has \\"never contemplated anything so drastic as a country walk,\\" he finds himself clambering over hill and stile to rendezvous with the kidnapper. Mountjoy maintains he wasn't the one who stabbed the reporter and pointedly stuffed a bouquet of red roses in her mouth, and demands that the real killer be found. Diamond jumps right in (it beats odd jobs in the supermarket), against the wishes of his superiors, who want him just to get the girl back and forget about reopening a case that could make the department look bad. But Diamond is interested in justice, and anyway, he's got the upper hand. The plot offers many avenues to explore: the roses","excerpt":"the dead woman's last assignment (which included an expose of Mountjoy's college); her swarm of suitors; even Jane Austen, who has a habit of figuring in Diamond's cases. Peter Lovesey also delivers a fine, unguessable ending; easy interaction between Diamond's computer-age associate, Julie Hargreaves, and the old-fashioned detective; and mostly convincing characters (Mountjoy, the exception, is a bit of a stiff). \\"The Summons\\" is good stuff.

He was fired by an unamused King James I.   Two obvious candidates for a Wotton Cup are Robert White and Deane Hinton, who lost their jobs in El Salvador by stating the unwelcome truth that crimes against human rights there routinely went unpunished because they were mostly perpetrated by ''our'' allies in the security forces.   It tells a lot about American frustration that President Reagan's latest man in San Salvador, Thomas Pickering, is now sounding the same note. Observing a surge of murders by death squads - and threats even against El Salvador's Archbishop - Ambassador Pickering said pointedly the other day that the human rights scandal jeopardizes ''the sort of support that the Administration and many members of Congress would like to give.'' An unnamed aide added what everyone knows: that the death squads are composed of active and America's Diplomats Had Good Reason To Be Undiplomatic former army and security officers serving the interests of the far right.  Mr. Hinton was even blunter a year ago when he described El Salvador's legal system as ''rotten.'' He condemned right-wing ''thugs'' and warned that American aid would end if midnight murders did not cease. But the White House disowned the warning and finally removed Mr. Hinton, as it had removed his predecessor, Mr. White.

In the past, the likes of Joan Miro, Antoni Tapies, Alberto Burri and Annie Leibovitz have done World Cup posters\\nWHY PETER MAX? \\"We wanted an American artist, but one who was internationally known,\\" said Jeff Bliss, the senior vice president for marketing for World Cup '94. \\"A popular artist who would appeal to more than a specific niche.\\" From a dozen possibilities, it came down to Mr. Max, who proved to be \\"the best fit,\\" Mr. Bliss said. And Mr. Max is a global guy -- born in Germany in 1937 and raised in China, Israel, France and then Brooklyn. He's also an old hand when it comes to posters: this year alone he was commissioned to create posters for Super Bowl XXVIII, the Grammy Awards and the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival\\nTHE MAX SPIN: Mr. Max has always had a predilection for the celestial -- he has even given his children the nicknames Astro and Cosmo -- so it's not surprising that he has put a spacey spin on this design. It shows a soccer player suspended in the stratosphere, hovering over the United States, whose shape has been filled in with the stars and stripes (two stars, six stripes). There is a heart, too, -- because, Mr. Max said, \\"America still has a big heart.\\" Nothing's left to the imagination.\\n\\n\\"It's very Peter Max,\\" the artist said. That's probably the best way to put it. Very splashy, very North American Soccer League. Its bright yellow, red and oranges will make you shield your eyes at times. And cover your ears: it's loud. What's the patronizing word the British use to describe the American sports-hype machine? -- razzmatazz\\nWHERE: Right now, the original is at Mr. Max's gallery, called Viamax, in New York. Soon it will be shipped off to the headquarters of FIFA, world soccer's governing body, in Zurich, perhaps to be auctioned off for charity. The poster, which will sell for $14.95, will be available later this month at all World Cup stadiums and at retail stores across the country. The World Cup organization itself is accepting phone orders ($14.95, plus $6 postage and handling) at (800) 827-2270. \\nPREDECESSORS: The most lavish poster campaign by far was for the matches in Spain in 1982, which was also one of the quirkiest World Cups in recent memory. Miro, in his unmistakable whimsical style, put forth the sumptuous design called \\"La Fiesta,\\" a surreal something-or-other in brilliant reds and yellows -- the colors of Spain. There were also separate posters created for each of the 14 Spanish cities in which the games were played. For Barcelona, Mr. Tapies, who is also fervent Catalonian nationalist, created a defiant, exultant graffiti-scrawled design.\\n\\nAnnie Leibovitz, too? Sure. For the 1986 World Cup, in Mexico, the renowned photographer produced 12 enigmatic photographic posters, including one for each of the cities where games took place. The poster for Mexico City, showing just the mysterious shadow of a futbolista against Toltec ruins, was chosen as the flagship.\\n\\nEach World Cup since the first one, in 1930, has produced something memorable. The poster for the first World Cup, in Uruguay, was, predictably, high Art Deco","excerpt":"the deadpan Mexico 1970 poster simply showed a deconstructed soccer ball against a matte purple background; Chile's ethereal poster from 1962 shows a soccer ball orbiting the earth, making it an austere precursor to Mr. Max's design; Argentina 1978 produced a pointillistic photomontage; and World Cup Willie, the ball-kicking lion, starred on England's quaint 1966 offering. \\nONLY IN AMERICA: Take another look at Max's soccer player.

WHAT'S UP WITH INFLATION? -- Many people would like to know more about inflation. They will be reading some clues on Monday, when the Commerce Department will offer figures for September on personal income, personal spending and the personal consumption expenditures deflator (derived from personal spending statistics excluding food and energy prices). In August, consumers held back, spending only 0.1 percent more than in July, the smallest month-to-month increase since November; analysts polled by Bloomberg predict that the figure for September will be higher, at 0.3 percent.    MORE MEASUREMENTS -- Other economic indicators expected this week: consumer confidence in the United States for October (Tuesday); construction spending for September, home sales for September, and vehicle sales for October (Wednesday); factory orders for September (Thursday); and the unemployment rate for October (Friday).

But now that Dr. Hammer is gone, Ray R. Irani, Oxy's new chairman, has a free hand. And last week he started moving toward his stated mission of trimming the company's $8.8 billion of debt by $3 billion this year. He made a deal to sell 50 percent of Trident Energy Inc., a producer of liquefied natural gas, for $600 million to a subsidiary of Hicks, Muse & Company, a Dallas-based investment firm. After taxes and other costs, the deal will yield $432 million for Occidental. Then he sold Oxy's North Sea oil and gas holdings for $1.35 billion to France's Societe Nationale Elf Aquitaine and Enterprise Oil P.L.C. of Britain. Mr. Irani is now more than halfway to his goal. And the market likes it. Occidental shares closed the week at $21.125, up $2.125. NCR -- Who Is the Real Winner?  Who benefits most from A.T.& T's $7.4 billion purchase of the NCR Corporation? The American Telephone & Telegraph Company says it does","excerpt":"the deal puts it back in the computer business. But the real winners may be the Wall Street firms that advised the companies during their five-month fight. The advisers get millions in fees at a time when dealmaking is all but dead. Dillon Read & Company and Goldman Sachs & Company, which advised NCR, will each receive about $18.5 million. Morgan Stanley & Company, which advised A.T.& T., will get $13.28 million. Proxy solicitation firms also did well. Morrow & Company will receive $1.7 million and Georgeson & Company will receive $2 million for trying to sway NCR's stockholders. And then there were the lawyers. Two firms will split $20 million for the paperwork.  Metromedia's Mighty Returns  John W. Kluge, the billionaire chairman of the Metromedia Company, has been making money even in the money-losing cellular-telephone business. His formula has been simple: unload as much of your holdings as you can. Last week, he sold Metromedia's cellular telephone company in Philadelphia for $1.1 billion. The buyer was the Comcast Corporation, an operator of cable television systems there. Metromedia, based in Secaucus, N.J., is one of the nation's largest private partnerships. Since 1986, when it began selling its cellular systems in New York, Washington, Baltimore, Boston and Chicago, the partnership has received $3 billion. The company invested just $20 million in Philadelphia a decade ago. Not a bad return for Mr. Kluge. Troubles for G.M.'s Saturn  The General Motors Corporation spent $3.5 billion just to get the Saturn Corporation off the ground. It was supposed to be \\"a laboratory for all of G.M.,\\" said Ronald Glantz, an automobile analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds in San Francisco. But last week it announced it would be replacing 1,836 of its 1991 model cars that were filled with the wrong coolant. And another laboratory -- one at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration -- said Saturn was not as safe as any of the other cars in its class in a front-end collision. Should G.M. and the nation's Saturn owners be worried? \\"The data bear little relationship to reality,\\" Mr. Glantz said. \\"Saturn is under a magnifying glass right now. It was a smooth startup and it's a good product.\\"  USX Bidding Farewell to Steel  Carl C. Icahn wants the USX Corporation to sell its steel business, the nation's largest. Mr. Icahn, the company's biggest shareholder, is finally getting his way. Last week, shareholders approved a plan to separate the company's stock into two groups. One would comprise the steel business; the other, the Marathon Oil Company. With two groups of stock, the steel business would be easier to sell. Charles A. Corry, the company's chairman, is talking to potential buyers. Of Batteries, Beer and Bunnies  First there was \\"Harvey,\\" the six-foot rabbit in the 1954 movie starring Jimmy Stewart.  This time around, there are two: one mechanical and one played by Leslie Nielsen, the star of \\"Naked Gun.\\" And the bunny masters are suing each other. Eveready, the battery-making subsidiary of the Ralston Purina Company, alleged last week in a lawsuit that the Adolph Coors Company was unfairly parodying its mechanical rabbit in a new series of commercials starring Mr. Nielsen. Coors, in a countersuit, is trying to stop Eveready from interfering with its new campaign. The problem, said Eveready, is that it doesn't want people to associate its bunny with beer. In Brief  The Justice Department said a subsidiary of Japan's NEC Corporation agreed to pay $34 million in fines to settle charges that it rigged bids on contracts worth $103 million at an American military base in Japan. THE ECONOMY   Inflation? Forget the Veggies  Vegetable prices rose by an astonishing 34.5 percent in April due to a heat wave in Florida. Important, of course, if you like vegetables. But more than that: the jump was enough to throw the entire Producer Price Index out of whack. Prices were up 0.2 percent for the month, according to the Commerce Department. On the other hand, the P.P.I. indicator of inflation showed a 0.4 percent decline in intermediate goods and a 0.5 percent decrease in crude goods. \\"The trend continues in the right direction,\\" said Mickey Levy, chief economist at C.R.T. Government Securities in New York. \\"Inflation is coming down.\\" Housing Sales Up, Prices Down  The housing slump appears to be bottoming out, even in the Northeast. That is what a survey of bank examiners by the Commerce Department said last week. First-quarter sales were up, but at a cost -- falling prices. In another report, this one by the National Association of Realtors, the median price for a home in the United States slipped 0.5 percent, to $95,400 -- the second quarterly drop in a row.  The Productivity Twist and Turn  At first it seemed the recession had finally turned the corner -- into depression. American business productivity had fallen nine-tenths of 1 percent during the first quarter, the Labor Department said. But then the department corrected itself. Productivity was not down, it was up -- by a strong 1 percent.  Even the revised numbers were perplexing. Productivity, a broad measure of output per hours worked, fell in the manufacturing sector and rose in the service sector, the reverse of a long-running trend. The recession has hurt sales, so manufacturing is down. But why the rise in services? \\"It may be an anomaly,\\" said said Robert Ortner, former chief economist at the Commerce Department.  \\"Every golden glove winner drops a pop fly now and then.\\"  A Few Fewer Layoffs  New claims for unemployment benefits fell 9 percent at the end of April, the Labor Department said. \\"The layoff rate is diminishing,\\" said Alan Sinai, an economist at the Boston Company. \\"But we're still in recession.\\" INTERNATIONAL   Iraq Says It Will Pay Later  The allies got no spoils from the war with Iraq, only costs. Under the terms of a United Nations Security Council resolution, at least some of those costs -- not yet determined -- are to be paid by Iraq. The resolution calls on United Nations Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar to suggest a maximum percentage of Iraq's oil revenue to be used for rebuilding Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. But in a letter last week to Mr. Perez de Cuellar, Iraq asked for a five-year moratorium on those payments. It needs the time, the letter said, to rebuild its oil exporting capacity to 3 million barrels a day -- its prewar level -- from a current 2 million. It also needs time to repair its infrastructure. After all that is done, the letter said, Iraq will be willing to help rebuild the neighborhood its troops destroyed. Sharing Soviet Power  1Boris N. Yeltsin, the popular president of the Russian Republic, is up for election next month. There is little doubt he will win. Even so, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev gave Mr. Yeltsin's campaign a lift when he agreed to transfer control of most of Siberia's coal industry to Russia. The transfer is important because coal is the Soviet Union's principal energy source. It is also important because Mr. Yeltsin has been complaining that Russia controls just 16 percent of its resourceslike oil. Far too little. Transferring the mines is a clear sign that a deal has been struck between by the two leaders. To avert a civil war, they may be ready to share power. Banned in Arabia  Since 1967, much of the Arab world has been boycotting the Coca-Cola Company (and hundreds of others) for doing business with Israel. On hot days, Pepsi Cola was the only soft drink around. But in a gesture of thanks to the United States, the Arab League's Boycott Office removed four American companies from its list after the gulf war. Coca Cola, the J.B. Williams Company, Helene Curtis Inc. and the Home Insurance Company can now do business in the Arab Middle East. The only trouble is, 110 companies have been added to the list, including all those in which Britain's Robert Maxwell, new owner of The New York Daily News, has an interest. Mr. Maxwell is starting a Russian language paper in Israel.

At the time, some of us were already so sophisticated that we could not only listen to whole operas, voices and all, but detect the difference between Hans Hotter and Russell Oberlin. We whooped in derision at the oafs who bought and presumably played these wordless operas, which stood in connoisseur esteem just one level below records bearing such titles as ''The Heart of the Concerto.''   Now, however, I wonder if opera without words may not have been an idea ahead of its time and one now worth reviving.

It was only Yitzhak Rabin, among contemporary Israeli leaders, who had the credibility and courage to sell the peace treaty with Yasir Arafat to the Israeli public. Israel's Foreign Minister, Shimon Peres, deserves  enormous credit for having the initial vision to see the possibility for a breakthrough between Israel and the Palestinians, and to push Mr. Rabin in that  direction.
