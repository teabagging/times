A broadcast pioneer who worked in both radio and television during their formative years, Mr. Young spent his entire professional life in the industry, having begun his career at NBC radio at the age of 17. The oldest of eight children, his income was needed to help support the family. During this time he also served as a page for the grand opening of Radio City Music Hall and was involved in NBC's move to its new Rockefeller Center headquarters. He eventually moved from the position of Head Page, through the Programming Department, and on to the Research and Promotion Department, where he developed a flair for mathematics which he successfully applied throughout his career. At night, Mr. Young managed the New Amsterdam Theater for NBC where many of the popular Big Bands of the era performed for live radio broadcasts. In 1936 he left NBC Radio and went into the advertising industry. Within eight years, he started his own business, Adam Young, Inc., representing radio stations in the United States, Canada and around the world. Eventually, with the development of a new broadcast technology, the focus of the Company shifted from representing radio stations to representing television stations. In 1986, Mr. Young co-founded Young Broadcasting Inc. with his son, Vincent, which began with the purchase of two television stations. Today the NASDAQ - traded company owns and operates 10 television stations across the United States. The Young Broadcasting station group includes ABC, CBS and NBC affiliates, as well as the nation's largest independent station--KRONTV in San Francisco.

Jesus's evasive reply to the Pharisees acknowledges the conflicting claims of the secular and spiritual world. The history of the efforts to mediate between the material and the spiritual, moral, intellectual and esthetic - and of giving each fear its just due - has traditionally been told through humanistic or liberal-arts education.   ''Liberal arts'' is the translation of what the Roman philosopher Cicero called liberales (or humaniores) artes, ''free'' or ''more human'' arts/ skills. These were the arts proper to a free person - i.e., one who was not a slave - and proper to a human being, an animal who has powers of speech and reason. They included all major branches of learning. The most important aim of liberal-arts education - one seldom questioned until our own time - has been to instill moral values and to develop powers of moral judgment. In classical times this aim was implemented through the reading of literature -Homer, the lyric poets, the dramatists, Vergil.

The senior statesmen of the basketball establishment have, correctly, risen as one to deplore the conditions, whatever they were, that contributed to this untimely and shocking loss of a fine young athlete, a nascent superstar.   Several years ago Dr. Joseph A. Pursch wrote an article in these pages entitled ''Our Stars Fall With Our Help,'' (Jan. 15, 1984).

We cannot speak for the radio ads, but we assume the critics review a play and not its advertising. \\"Shimada\\" is about prejudice, about one man's inability to let go of the past and release the bitterness of his war experiences. It is also about survival; about relationships between generations, between labor and management, and between friends.    But most of all it is about the need for healing between East and West, a healing that can only take place when xenophobia, which you erroneously associate with the play, is faced, acknowledged and finally released.   The play's structure blends Western theater and Kabuki theater in a cross-fertilization of the two cultures that resonates on many levels. If the reviewers were not attuned to those other levels, the audience was, as evidenced by the cheering standing ovations on opening night and at both performances on Saturday.   Audience members lined the streets outside after the shows and told us tearfully how sorry they were we were closing.    They said: \\"This is what Broadway has needed, a real play about real issues.\\" \\"Where do we write? How can we help? It's not fair that the critics should have the power to close a play as good as this and not give the audience time to see it.\\"   The cast's exultation at the overwhelming opening-night reception was shattered by the critics, who saw only the surface, literal aspects of the play. We were shocked and stunned that they had missed what the play was about, that it was designed to stimulate questions, not give easy answers, to encourage people to look at their own prejudice, the old wounds on both sides. That is why a reference to Hiroshima is introduced.   Japan is not the largest foreign investor in the United States. Britain is, but there is no Britain-bashing. Why not? Is it perhaps the white skin? If so, we are xenophobic, and that is what the play explores.    We respect the right of critics to a different opinion from the creative artists who have worked months on a play. We are all willing to take our licks in this business, but please do not impugn our honor by calling us prejudiced when we employ our God-given gifts to tell our deepest truths about the moral failure of prejudice.

It was precisely this restlessness, his passionate desire to develop and expand Carnegie Hall's programming and venues, and to invest heavily in education for the next generation of concert goers, that were the unusual marks of accomplishment Lincoln Center so deeply appreciated in him. We extend our deepest condolences to his family and friends. Sincerely, Bruce Crawford, Chairman Reynold Levy, President Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts     HARTH--Robert J.

IN AND OUT OF BOOKS"},{"year":"1992","title":"The Harried Novice     The lot of young actors in the Victorian theater was not an easy one, as is illustrated in a letter by Jerome K. Jerome (who later became a playwright and novelist), quoted in \\"Theatre in the Victorian Age\\" by Martin R. Booth (Cambridge University).   A stock company was organized on true repertory principles, which meant that the evening's bill could be frequently changed, and because there might be two or three pieces on the bill a new actor was faced with a bewildering and exhausting variety of parts. . . . In the early 1880's Jerome K. Jerome wrote to a friend from a country theater about the two-week visit of a London star:   \\"His list consists of 18 pieces -- eight 'legitimate,' five dramas, four comedies and a farce","excerpt":"and we only had a week in which to prepare. . . . First, I took all the parts given me, and studied them straight off one after the other. Then I found I'd got them all jumbled up together in my head and the more I tried to remember what belonged to which, the more I forgot which belonged to what. At rehearsal I talked Shakespeare in the farce, and put most of the farce and a selection from all the five dramas into one of the comedies.\\" How to Make a Merry Year     Francois Rabelais, the irreverent author of the satirical novel \\"Gargantua and Pantagruel,\\" offered a surprising opinion to a friend who had asked what astronomers were predicting about the upcoming year of 1535. His letter is included in \\"The Complete Works of Francois Rabelais,\\" translated and edited by Donald M. Frame (University of California).    Summarily exposing to you about this year what I've been able to extract from the authors in the field, Arab and Latin. . . . in this year will come only machinations, carryings-on, bases, and seeds of the unhappiness to follow. If we have good weather, that will be beyond the promise of the stars. . . . That's what they say. For my part, I say that if the . . . kings, princes, and communities hold in reverence the divine Word of God and according to that govern themselves and their subjects, then never in our time did we see a year more salubrious for bodies, more peaceful for souls, than this one will be: and we shall see the face of heaven, the covering of the earth, and the bearing of the people more joyous, merry, pleasant and benign, than it has been for fifty years back. Dreaming About Going Home       We never forget the rooms in which we were raised, as Michael Ann Williams discovered from the elderly subjects she interviewed for a study of homes in the early 20th century. This is from \\"Homeplace: The Social Use and Meaning of the Folk Dwelling in Southwestern North Carolina\\" (University of Georgia).    It is not the property or the landscape, any more than it is the physical structure, that is important. The empty house site, or the empty house, is a symbol of the experience, or memories of the experience, of home. . . . People who no longer have physical access to their homeplace seek solace in the power of narrative. Through their stories people may still travel home. Many of the narratives I heard had been polished over the years, as people studied on their pasts and gave shape to their experiences. For the people who told them, the stories, too, were precious symbols of home. For scholars these stories are also artifacts. While many times I crossed snaky fields in high boots and crept gingerly across rotting porches to inspect old structures, the entrance to the home place, I found, was through these oral narratives. The Natural Theater of the New     The art critic Robert Hughes, using Zurich's Cafe Odeon as an example, asserts that European cafes were the nurseries in which many of the most provocative, persistent elements of modern culture first emerged. This is from \\"The Shock of the New\\" (Knopf, paper).   Today, the phrase \\"cafe intellectual\\" is a mild, obsolete insult. Then, places like the Odeon were a medium of intellectual life, quite as much as the literary magazines. People separated from the social order, by choice or not, needed the cafe as their study and opera house: a place to meet, work, argue, and display themselves. It was a place for little groups, for specialists, where one met one's intellectual peers -- the essence of metropolitanism, and therefore of modernism, which in its self-referring ironies and sense of civilization was an urban sensibility, born in the cities, petering out in the country. The cafes of Zurich, Berlin, Barcelona, Vienna, Milan and Paris were the natural home of exiles, and modernism was largely the creation of exiles and polyglots, from Picasso the Spaniard to Beckett the Irishman. The Odeons, in short, were the natural theater of the new. In them, the intellectuals, writers and artists could feel and behave like a class, the mandarins of change. The Art of Asking Questions     The ornithologist Robert W. McFarlane reminds us that every advance in science begins with an exactly phrased question. This is from \\"A Stillness in the Pines: The Ecology of the Red-Cockaded Woodpecker\\" (Norton).   Science, from one perspective, is the art of phrasing questions and identifying their attendant assumptions. Its basic tenet is that nature has no secrets. The obstacles to furthering knowledge lie in formulating the right questions and in circumventing ambiguous answers, never an easy task. The best practitioners know that incisive questions and skillful analysis will ultimately yield their reward. Artful questions may require new technology, often from unrelated disciplines. New questions may require fresh insight, unencumbered by the baggage of past experience, and a probing mind to test old concepts. The importance of the proper question is often overlooked, by experienced observer and novice alike.

In its seventh year, the restaurant is a well-ensconced neighborhood eatery with a cadre of regular customers who seem already to have discovered their favorite items and stuck to them. \\n\\n On balance, dishes have promise, but the kitchen work was notably uneven. Nonetheless, the highs were a delight and well worth seeking out. Most of the other renditions proved acceptable, without ringing any bells. To Hacienda's significant credit, intelligent restraint went into the applications of cheese, a welcome departure from the glopped-over messes one encounters in so many other Mexican restaurants. And service was prompt and attentive. \\n\\n At the start, Hacienda Don Emilio puts on the table a mighty tasty salsa whose relatively low heat allows the vegetable flavors to come through. (The kitchen will add fire for diners who like it.) The nachos served with it were markedly fresh. Those planning to linger over a meal might order guacamole, the avocado nicely ripe on two tries. \\n\\n Quesado especial, another opener, lent itself to sharing -- as did platters of most tortilla-wrapped items. This satisfying sampler included tortillas filled with shredded chicken (flauta), somewhat dry and chewy shredded beef (chimichanga) and plain melted cheese. Sour cream and guacamole accompanied this as well as a number of other dishes. Folded into flour tortillas, the chorizo, or Spanish sausage, of queso fundido was rather dense, as it most often is, and a touch dry. A disappointing ceviche tasted fishy, the marinated snapper past its peak of freshness. And thin-flavored black bean soup has been better. \\n\\n Chicken flautas could also be had as an entree, as could any of the items in the appetizer quesado especial. Also from the Mexican Standards side of the menu, enchiladas suizas proved pleasant enough with a dousing of green tomato sauce.\\n\\nA large part of the menu deals with Mexican Specialties, although some may argue that there is Texan influence on some items in this category. No less successful for this appelation, however, was tacos al carbon, the simplest and delicious best of all the offerings we tasted. No dried-out shreds of beef that appeared in the chimichangas were found in this hauntingly smoky number. This steak was broiled to rare-medium and the thin, luscious slices, still rosy at center, were packed into a soft tortilla.\\n\\nAnd similar, juicy steak fajitas rated somewhat better than lime-edged chicken fajitas, the bird needing more moistness. On the other hand, billed as filet mignon, the cubed beef appearing in banderilla Cozumel was fibrous, like stewing beef, and overdone","excerpt":"and we saw not much merit in the addition of shrimp to this skewered dish. \\n\\nIn general, when it came to spiciness, the kitchen veered to the mild, safer side of seasoning. But the promised Yucatan spices and the sour-orange marinade meant to flavor the pork in tacos de cochinita pibil were, perhaps, too subtle. Although passable, the dish needed the spark of some decisive flavors. \\n\\n Once sauteed shrimp Mazatlan were tough and dry, the accompanying onions, tomatoes and sweet green pepper by far the better part of this combination. Another visit found the shrimp fresh tasting and juicy in a similar style called madrigal. \\n\\nDesserts slipped down easily. From a pleasant assortment we chose smooth, weightless hacienda Kahlua mousse, mango ice cream and sopapillas; make no mistake, this last is meant to be shared whether in whole or in half-order. These light, fried flat pastries arrived topped generously with scoops of ice cream, a healthy drizzle of honey, slices of peach, mounds of whipped cream and a dusting of cinnamon.\\n\\n The food is filling and the price range wide.

But I think the other sources from which they harvest it are cadavers. Wednesday.  Had to give blood to be stored up in case I need it during the operation. I was asked a lot of personal questions. A funny nurse told me about the time she swallowed her contact lenses in college, couldn't afford a new pair and had to retrieve them. I ate some Oreos and it was over. If I don't use the blood, it goes into the blood bank. What if Liz ended up with my blood? We'd be linked for life, though I would never presume to mention it. I would remain anonymous. Thursday A.M.  It said in the paper that patients with living wills, who leave instructions to have the plug pulled when they're brain dead, have lower hospital bills. I have a living will, and was very excited about this at first. Then I realized they probably had lower hospital bills because they died earlier than people who don't have living wills. I'm sure Liz has a living will. I read a biography about her that said she'd had 32 operations, and that was years ago. Who knows how many she's had by now? She's a pro. Was Liz given a packet of Betadine and told to wash herself with it at home the night before her operation, the way I was? What about the Fleets? It gives the whole experience a nice do-it-yourself feeling. My bathroom smells like Betadine now, just like the hospital. I saw an ad for Elizabeth Taylor's perfume. \\"Fragrant Jewels,\\" it said. When you buy a bottle, there's a bonus: a pair of 3.2-carat cubic zirconia earrings. I don't have zirconia earrings of that size, or any size, yet. I do have a little cabochon emerald ring that I bought from Christopher Walling before he became a jeweler to sheiks and movie stars. It doesn't seem to have a fragrance, actually. I love jewelry; and if I had a lot of it, I'd have that in common with Liz, too. I once read in The New York Post that Liz might have been the anonymous bidder who paid $104,000 for Christopher's rose diamond earrings. The resemblance is getting uncanny. P.M.  Better start packing. Tomorrow is the big day. What do you wear in the hospital? More to the point -- what will Liz wear? Probably her 3.2 zirconia studs. I think I will pack nothing. The hospital provides suitable attire, and you get those plastic basins and a personal bottle of mouthwash. Towels are included. Green foam-rubber slippers with a happy face embossed on the front. It will be a relief, actually, not to have think to about how I'm dressed. A vacation. Liz must feel the same way -- even more so. For a moment I find it difficult to picture her. Then I see her beautiful shoulders draped with the thin cotton gown, the hospital's undisclosed name printed across the front, and, pinned proudly above it, a bright red AIDS ribbon.

Today, he reports, college life is a choice between organization and alienation. College without criticism falls short of being critical","excerpt":"and when campus no longer leads the culture, college as we know it is coming to an end. But if college was college before Perlstein was there, collegians once learned not to question society’s values but to uphold them. Whether it translates to a hippie’s dream or a hipster’s nightmare, college is still society, caricatured: the sixties were a liberating time for everyone involved, not just the freshmen, and if college then inculcated an era-appropriate dose of dissent, college these days does just as good a job raising respect for the establishment. It’s the very stillness of true conservatism that allows its impact to slide by unnoticed, and so while Perlstein is right to note today’s collegiate sea change, I don’t see the level of questioning he hearkens to occurring anywhere, whether on campus or off. No wonder the celebration of universities has quieted since the hippies’ heyday; today’s political climate holds its dissidents and intellectuals at bay.

But no sooner are they spliced and lodged in one apartment than they begin getting on each other's nerves, brooding in undisguised boredom and looking around outside.After two or three tepid encounters with elaborately unstable types, they decide the only way they can be happy together is to live as they did at first—apart.Since both are uninteresting people, despite the mild endeavors that are made by Mr. Tognazzi and Miss Riva to inflate them with a little zip and charm, one can only assume that any relationship between them is doomed to monotony, and thus dismiss as a hopeless misadventure this feeble display of marital discord and of Mr. Salce's professional delinquency that is now at the Embassy and the Guild.

Both exemplify the kind of regional, working-class actor who seemed to dominate British theater and cinema in the 1960's. Both come from the North of England. Both played Billy Liar on the London stage.  Yet, for the first time, they are now appearing together, in roles which call for a virtual symbiosis. The vehicle is a $6 million film version - directed by Peter Yates - of Ronald Harwood's stage hit, ''The Dresser,'' being shot at London's Pinewood Studios.   Mr. Finney plays Sir, a tired, old touring actor-manager taking his tacky Shakespearean troupe around a bomb-strewn England in 1942. Mr.  Courtenay re-creates his stage role (which he played in London and New York) of Norman, the effeminate dresser who dedicates his energy to getting Sir onto the stage for a performance of King Lear. In the film, the relationship between the two men is a bit like that of Shakespeare's Lear and Fool. On the set, the two actors lapse easily into a jokey, Mutt-and-Jeff rivalry.

That first hour, although it is not too well or tightly written, is extremely well directed, by Gordon Flemyng, with fine chases on the order of \\"Bullitt\\" and meaningful uses of the split screen when the credits are on. The acting by supporting characters—Gene Hackman, Julie Harris, Ernest Borgnine, Jack Klugman, Warren Oates, James Whitmore and particularly Donald Sutherland—is solid and lean","excerpt":"and when Mr. Sutherland delivers one of a few perfect lines (\\"The last man I killed for $5,000. For $85,000 I'd kill you 17 times.\\"), the audience at the New Amsterdam, which limits its enthusiasm in other parts of the picture (which is in color) to appreciative cries of \\"Punch him in the mouth,\\" goes respectfully wild.The plot concerns a group, organized and led by Mr. Brown, who steal the receipts at a professional football game while the game is going on. This leads to a kind of time-tension while sport is in progress, as in \\"The Killing\\" or \\"Strangers on a Train.\\" There are many witty and excellent scenes: a pickup in a bar while two gentlemen are in conversation, the look of lecherous, flattered astonishment on the picked up gentleman's face; a man trapped in a safe, who does not dare take his foot off the button that keeps the door open and who, standing on one foot, strips off his clothes to fling them over a photoelectric cell; an asthma attack in midrobbery; the shooting out, with a high-powered rifle, of the tires of a car to cause a grand and useful traffic jam. Mr. Brown's part is not written with much characterization (his job is mainly to humiliate a series of whites until they are sufficiently impressed to accept his leadership); neither is Miss Carroll's (she has to be insipidly used and nice).But in its last half hour the picture (based on a novel by Richard Stark) makes a sudden and extremely ambitious leap outside its genre: a white neighbor, originally almost irrelevant to the story, tries to rape Miss Carroll and existentially spoils the crime. It is hard to adjust one's mood from pleasant, color-transposed genre thriller to something racially serious, yet the movie is tactful about it (when a white colleague starts calling Mr. Brown \\"Boy,\\" it is not stressed) and the film is almost completely successful in its two unmatched parts.Although his role is not major, Donald Sutherland is remarkable. As the babyfaced soldier who impersonates a colonel in \\"The Dirty Dozen,\\" as the troubled friend of the family In \\"Interlude\\" and particularly as an aristocrat dying of leukemia in \\"Joanna\\" (which was shown before the strike at Cannes, and which will shortly open here), Mr. Sutherland has shown a range of comic-sentimental talent that is absolutely star quality. In \\"The Split,\\" speaking as usual slowly and thickly nearly to the point of speech impediment, menacing as a soft, funny maniac for guns, aiming his pistol at the trousers of a man he is guarding, he has both a specific personality of his own and the ability to vary it to the precise demands of divergent roles. Mr. Brown and Miss Carroll, although they have done better work in other parts, do as well as their almost impersonal roles permit in this one; and judging from audience reaction at nearly every film with Negroes in it in the past two years, we may be well on the way to a whole cast of black matinee idols, with genuine starring parts to evolve for them in the course of time.

Handel's long and eloquent musical ode, on the other hand, takes ethical and psychological abstractions at the start and then uses music to help transpose them into concrete images.   Handel's librettist, Charles Jennens, has assembled Milton's two great opposing poems, ''L'Allegro'' and ''Il Penseroso'' - one dealing with man's happy, celebratory nature, the other evoking his melancholy and perhaps more spiritual side. The two are then interlaced into a single text of abruptly alternating moods and to them is added a conciliatory summation at the end - a poetical ending intended to bring these mood swings into harmony. Handel's music uses vocal soloists, chorus and orchestra, but voices do not serve as opposing ''characters'' in this spiritual debate. Thus, the happier climate of ''L'Allegro'' is shared by tenor, soprano and bass, as is ''Il Moderato'' at the end.

For once more, as in that previous picture, wherein the experiences of prisoners of war slowly brought on a deflation of their illusions as patriots, M. Cayette is exposing the disenchantment of two French prisoners in World War II. His trenchant and caustic exposition opened at the Guild yesterday.And again, as in that previous picture (which was made by Jean Renoir and first exhibited in this country in 1938), M. Cayatte is constructing a sense of the barren irony of finding friends and compassion among one's \\"enemies\\" and hatred and distrust among one's countrymen.M. Cayatte is a cynic. That has been thoroughly manifest in his biting dramas about aspects of the French legal system, \\"We Are All Murderers\\" and \\"Justice Is Done.\\" He champions the individual against political separatists and bureaucrats. He regards institutions and systems as the mortal enslavers of man.Now he has turned his cynicism upon the monstrous institution of war and upon the ideals of freedom and self-determination, for which men are induced to fight and die.But his stricture is not dry or preachy, a compact of flat philosophy. It is absorbingly tense and dramatic, in the vein of a crisp adventure film. Its comment upon the \\"grand illusion\\" of men put to fighting a war for \\"freedom\\" or just to \\"kill Boches\\" is implicit in everything it shows. While the ending may seem inconclusive or reluctant in resolving its strong theme, this is characteristic of M. Cayatte. And, besides, is there one to be had?In substance, \\"Tomorrow Is My Turn,\\" which M. Cayatte also wrote, in collaboration with Pascal Jardin, Armand Jamot and Maurice Auberge, is the story of two disparate Frenchmen, one a strong-minded, virile journalist and the other a gentle, fatalistic little Parisian pastry cook. They become fortuitous companions in a German village and on a near-by farm to which they are sent to be laborers after they have been taken prisoners in the early months of the war.The journalist yearns for freedom. He wants to escape and get back into the war. The pastry cook is content to remain hors de combat with the farm family that treats him decently. And the heart of the drama is what happens when each does what he desires—when the journalist gets back to Paris and has to go underground (into the treachery-fringed Resistance) upon discovering that his old employer and his old girl friend are collaborationists","excerpt":"and when the little cook has to watch helplessly as his friendly \\"enemies\\" are grimly caught up in the war.It would be unfair to tell you how it all turns out, in a melodramatic climax that is nicely flavored with romance and sentiment. It would be unfair not to tell you that it is beautifully constructed, directed and played. M. Cayatte has put it together with the style of a tough-grained realist. His images have the texture of literally photographed events, yet he has also allowed his camera to catch glimpses of poetry. In scenes of squalor, there is beauty; in scenes of shame, there is eloquence. M. Cayatte has seen to it that people bulk large, as well as small.Largest are the two characters in the principal roles—the journalist, played fiercely and tersely by fair-haired Georges Rivière, and the pastry cook, played with haunting resignation by little, dark, sad-eyed Charles Aznavour. These actors give to the heroes much colorfulness and sympathy. It is also surprising how much M. Rivière resembles the young Jean Gabin.Cordula Trantow is most appealing as a cheerful German farm girl who falls for the more dynamic prisoner and is brutally (but understandably) deceived by him. Nicole Courcel is sleek and feline as the Parisian friend, and Jean Marchat is briefly lumpish as the two-faced publisher. Michel Etchevery is contemptibly hard-nosed as a village Gauleiter, and all the other performers are perfect in their roles.It is interesting to note that French and German are spoken as they would be by the respective French and German characters, but English subtitles are used only to translate the French. This puts the reader of the subtitles into identification with the French and effectively leaves the German dialogue dramatically alien to him.The English title, incidentally, is taken from a line spoken by the baker after the war when he is back in Paris. It barely hints at the picture's irony.

A runner-up for Britain's Trask Award for the best first novel of 1985, ''A Season of Peace'' is an extended meditation on grief and sorrow. As the narrator deals with the army bureaucracy in order to claim the body of his soldier son, killed by a terrorist bomb in Ireland, he recalls two periods of his own life as an army engineer: when he directed the construction of an antiaircraft battery on the coast of the North Sea","excerpt":"and when, at the end of World War II, he directed the installation's demolition. The narrator, never more than a concerned observer, tells us the story of the people at Cable Point, especially the tragedy of a 15-year-old named Mary. The novel discovers that war disrupts lives, perverts values, and has consequences far from the field of battle long after the battle is done. G. E. Armitage writes cleanly and even elegantly, but trying to make fresh a theme as old as the ''Iliad,'' he strains for stylistic effects that become irritants. In lieu of a plot, we are presented with recurring images. Dead gulls, sailors, sharks or cats are forever being washed ashore at Cable Point, are always discovered by children, and are always made playthings. The characters speak elliptically. Little is said, a great deal understood, and a page or two later all is explained. The impatient reader will gloss over the dialogue and turn directly to the explanations.

As a result, grand palaces went up in states scarcely big enough, one might have thought, to support a small cottage; but in Bavaria, at least, a proper country Schloss made sense: As the head of one of the largest and most powerful states in Germany, the Elector Max Emmanuel could well afford to build on a large scale.

By JOHN RUSSELL   O ne of the oddest, oldest and most controversial facts about European travel is that if you want to understand the Parthenon in Athens you simply have to stop off in London on the way.   The reason for this is that the Parthenon -the temple of Athena that stands on top of the Acropolis Hill that dominates Athens - is a sculptural achievement, as much as an architectural one, and that since the beginning of the 19th century many of the most important sculptures from the Parthenon have been in the British Museum in London. They have never looked quite comfortable there. The light is wrong, the rooms are wrong, and the less.

In its try for grand themes, it presents an engaging combination of apocalyptic vision, high operatic silliness and unabashed swipes from masters of the past, ranging from Masaccio to Dali. And in the six larger works of Cucchi's third New York show, divided between Sperone Westwater, 142 Greene Street (through Dec. 1), and the Mary Boone-Michael Werner Gallery, 417 West Broadway (through Nov. 24), his reach is even more ambitious, in terms of scale and - well, cosmicality.   The show's portentous title is ''Vitebsk-Harar,'' two place names that refer - we are told in a catalogue introduction by an Italian poet, Mario Diacono - to opposite poles: the Vitebsk of Chagall's youth that was later politicized by the cultural bureaucracy of the Russian Revolution, and the Ethiopian city of Harar where the Symbolist poet Arthur Rimbaud spent the last, uncreative part of his short life. These references are not intended literally, Mr. Diacono writes, but to give the work a ''complexity of meanings, provoking the eye's reaching beyond mere pictorial construction.'' However, in the paintings black stands for ''the horror of Harar and Rimbaud's existence there, taken as the utmost symptom of the black light of the South in which the paintings of Cucchi live''","excerpt":"and white represents politicized Vitebsk, ''its nordic counterpart.''

Thomas Meighan's latest film, \\"We're All Gamblers,\\" was \\"suggested\\" by Sidney Howard's play, \\"Lucky Sam McCarver,\\" and those who saw the stage effort won't find even the bones in the shadow version. The play was quite a good entertainment, while the picture is unusually tedious. There is in Mr. Meighan's vehicle a constant effort to show that this screen Sam McCarver never falters in his upright conduct.This new Sam is a prizefighter who, it is pointed out, has never had a dent in his \\"mudguards,\\" and when he is in the hospital following an automobile accident, he will not even take a check for damages from the girl, who was responsible for his injuries.In the first chapter he won't sign an agreement to fight unless his foster mother is at his elbow, and then he has a lucky shirt, covered with autographs.When he decides to eke out a livelihood by running a night club he plays the piano","excerpt":"and who does he play for? Not the merry throng who may or may not bring their own champagne, but for Carlotta Asche. Sam even moves the piano near to where Carlotta is sitting, and despite the fact that he knows that his clientele is averse to anything but jazz he plays a twenty-year-old song that is supposed to bring a tear to some eyes.There is a murder in this film, but it comes at the end of the story instead of at the beginning, as in the play. Trust the film man for tearing things apart and switching the whole effect. There is no drama about this murder. The man who is killed happens to be the cad who gives bad checks and rides in expensive cars, hoping, of course, to marry Carlotta.It strikes one as strange that such a piece of work could have been directed by James Cruze, the director of \\"The Covered Wagon\\" and other fine pictures. It was supervised by Lucien Hubbard, but the person responsible for the so-called screen play is Hope Loring.Mr. Meighan does very little in this film that could be construed as acting. Marietta Millner is comely as Carlotta. Miss Millner succeeds very well with the role in the circumstances. \\"Gunboat\\" Smith plays the part of an ex-pugilist, and it might be said that he is quite well suited to the character, for he not only has a cauliflower ear but also signs of past battles on his nose.

Elstree and other studios in the neighborhood of London are busier than they have ever been before. It is recalled that there was a period, seven years ago, when not one single picture of any consequence was being shot in any British studio; and as today no less than twenty feature films are in course of simultaneous production within a radius of fifty miles from Charing Cross, a leading trade paper takes occasion to glory in \\"the resuscitation of the British effort to the position of an important and successful national industry\\" as \\"a romance without parallel.\\"A Hopeful Aspect.Suggestions that America has been \\"hoist with its own petard\\" are not infrequent; but for the most part British chroniclers are content to note that the native \\"film production is on its feet,\\" and while congratulating \\"those who have helped the industry to weather the two storms of bad production and talkies\\" to point out that \\"they are still learning\\" with a warning note that \\"so is Hollywood.\\" At the same time attention is drawn to German plans for \\"a great screen conquest of British and American theatres.\\" A casting director of the Ufa company has been in England engaging artists to appear in English-speaking versions of a number of the fifty or sixty pictures which Ufa counts upon turning out in the course of the next twelve months. A list of the English actors and actresses thus bespoken has been published, but competent as they presumably are to fill the doubling rôles assigned to them, their names are not of conjuring calibre. This reported German invasion of the English-speaking field is none the less an interesting and significant move.To descend from the general to the particular, it is considered that British production has achieved its greatest success by gaining top honors on the programs of two of the leading American-owned cinemas in the West End of London, the Plaza and the Empire. At the former the feature picture put on just before the Whitsuntide holiday was a farce based on an original scenario specially written for the screen by Mr. Ben Travers, whose \\"Rookery Nook\\" was voted in a plebiscite conducted by a weekly paper appealing to the masses to be the most popular British offering of 1930. Mr. Travers's new effort is called \\"The Chance of a Night Time,\\" and contains all the familiar ingredients of the boisterous, rollicking fare which the lower middle-class English audience takes a peculiar and particular delight in. Its chief distinction is really the characterization offered by Mr. Ralph Lynn in the rôle of a diffident lawyer who finds himself mistaken for the dancing partner of a professional lady engaged to entertain a country house party at which his fiancée is a guest.A Laugh Maker.Miss Winifred Shotter, who is a favorite member of the \\"Aldwych school,\\" is effective as Pauline, the danseuse, as she plays up well to Mr. Lynn, who, with an experience gained in Hollywood, has won what some judges hold to be the foremost place among English screen comedians. Here and there comparisons with the much more elaborate settings which Hollywood would have devised for a picture of this kind are unavoidable, but on the whole the genuine atmosphere and environment of an English country house has been retained; and there is compensation in verisimilitude for what the eye loses in the way of spectacle. It is announced that in its first week's run at the Plaza \\"The Chance of a Night Time\\" drew £5,700 ($28,500), and it is added that the only talking picture which has ever beaten this record at this exclusive West End house was \\"Anybody's Woman,\\" in which Miss Ruth Chatterton completed her conquest of London. Mr. Herbert Wilcox takes a justifiable pride in the fact that \\"The Chance of a Night Time\\" is the eighth, consecutive production by the British and Dominions Company to score an emphatic success. Though there is no gainsaying the fact that this picture is full of robustious humor, is pat in dialogue and quick in action for an English offering, there are still times when the onlooker is inclined to suggest \\"getting on with it.\\"\\"The Outsider.\\"Of quite a different order is \\"The Outsider,\\" a film version of a play by Miss Dorothy Brandon, of which only dim memories survive in the minds of most London theatregoers. Little or nothing had been heard in advance about this production by the general public. It was known in film-land that Mr. Eric Hakim, a financier who takes a personal interest in the cinema, was putting up the money, that Mr. Harry Lachman was directing, and that Mr. Harold Huth, an actor without much, if any, screen experience, and Miss Joan Barry, an actress with a beautiful voice, whose only connection with the films has been \\"dubbing\\" for Miss Anna Ondry, were playing the leading rôles. Scant attention was paid to what little news there was about the production of \\"The Outsider\\" until it was learned that Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer had arranged to take the film for their British quota requirements; and even that circumstance carried little promise of merit, according to those people who suspect American companies of bolstering up mediocre British work from interested motives. Individually and collectively, the London critics appear to have been taken completely by surprise when, on being bidden to the Empire Theatre to see \\"The Outsider,\\" they found it was by no means merely what is termed \\"a good program booking,\\" but a work of compelling interest, photographed with a perfection attained in few British studios, and developed on the screen by a continuity of action infrequently found in pieces transferred from stage to screen. One critic called it \\"the most polished talking picture yet made in a British studio\\" and added that \\"if 'The Outsider' is properly exploited in America it will be a sensation.\\" Another described it as \\"the greatest work of screen art I have ever seen.\\" This was Mr. G. A. Atkinson, formerly of The Daily Express and now of The Daily Telegraph. Mr. Atkinson prefaced his commendation with the sage remarks that \\"great works of art come without warning, and frequently take the critic by surprise. Even if he is sufficiently alert to detect the presence of the phenomenal there is always the probability that his opinion will not be respected by the unbelievers.\\" On the whole, the eulogies which \\"The Outsider\\" has received appear to be directed rather toward the performers than to either the play in which they appear or to the manner in which their efforts are registered.Expert Direction.Not that fault is found with Mr. Lachman's direction. On the contrary, he has done his part of the work not only skillfully but with that perfection of art which conceals the mechanism of art. Mr. Harold Huth is, however, the outstanding triumph of the production, with Miss Joan Barry playing an appealing rô1e as a cripple with sincerity and understanding. Mr. Huth's performance has placed him at one bound in the front rank of screen artists, and British directors and producers are urged to take advantage of their find and not let him be lost to the British screen, or lured away from it by the attractions of Hollywood.As far as the story of \\"The Outsider\\" is concerned, it may not appeal to the \\"mass taste.\\" It is that of a quack doctor, that is, not a properly qualified practitioner, according to the regulations held in honor by the British Medical Council, who undertakes to cure the crippled daughter of an eminent physician. The \\"bone-setter\\" (Harold Huth) is at the outset actuated chiefly by a desire to advertise himself, while the eminent medico's daughter (Joan Barry) is willing to put herself in any hands that will restore her to health and strength. The irregular practitioner, who is by no means a charlatan, but has all the air of one, falls in love with his patient, and she with him. Their love story is beautifully told and for those who like a genuine love story, devoid of \\"sophistication\\" and the other trappings with which things of that kind are too often invested in the cinema, \\"The Outsider\\" will have a vehement appeal. To say the very least of this picture, it is a welcome change from the clichés of the screen.The Fairbankses.Mr. Douglas Fairbanks and Miss Mary Pickford have been very much in the public eye, or in the newspapers which specialize in the goings and comings and other doings of film celebrities, since the former first arrived in England and the latter came to rejoin him. Their respective denials of anything like a rift in their matrimonial lute, both before and after their meeting at Reading on the way to London, have been the matter of as many sensational newspaper headlines as June's interviews about the divorce she is seeking from Lord Inverclyde at Reno. Miss Pickford appeared at the Regal Cinema on the opening night of her film \\"Kiki,\\" and was too bashful to deliver the speech with which she came prepared.

More publicity was extended to the making of \\"Tell England\\" than to its showing.For a period of several months one could hardly escape some reference in the public press to the work that was being done under the direction or Anthony Asquith, son of the Lord Oxford who had been Prime Minister of Great Britain and whose widow had begun to be famous in her youth as \\"Margot\\" Tennant","excerpt":"and with the cooperation of part of his Majesty's navy at Malta. \\"Tell England\\" was based on a story of that name written by Ernest Raymond, an \\"epic\\" of Gallipoli which enjoyed a somewhat brief period of popularity. The actual work of production took over eighteen months, for a major portion of the film was designed to represent real scenes and incidents of the historic landings of British and Australian forces on the Gallipoli beaches in April, 1915, and their successful withdrawal, one of the most sensational episodes of the war, in January of the following year. Sites were found at Malta which sufficiently resembled the Anzac and \\"V\\" beaches of the Gallipoli peninsula, and all the necessary apparatus and directional and technical staffs and so forth were transported to the British fortress island in the Mediterranean.Reconstructed Gallipoli Scenes.A reconstruction of the famous Clive, which figured so prominently in the landing operations, and attendant barges, was made; innumerable Maltese supers were engaged to play the rôles of the Turks, and sailors and marines from the men-of war in the Mediterranean squadron were officially \\"lent\\" by the British naval authorities to figure in the invading force. Geoffrey Barkas, who had directed the production of \\"Q Ship\\" and \\"The Somme,\\" in a sense semiofficial records of the valorous deeds of British soldiers and sailors during the great war, was associated with Anthony Asquith in what was reported to be the first attempt to throw any major war operation into complete dramatic and historical perspective.After public interest had been aroused to quite a high pitch by this implicit promise to provide the British nation with a home-made war film which might be expected to make a hundred per cent appeal to the patriotically minded amateurs of the cinema who had hitherto been fain to content themselves with American importations, there came a period of \\"intriguing\\" silence in reference to \\"Tell England.\\" People who had been anxiously waiting for its completion sought in vain for the preliminary announcements which are wont to blazon forth the merits of a soon-to-be-seen screen story on the grand scale. This silence was not only mysterious and productive of a crop of rumors; it continued for so long a space of time that the general public, which is suspected of having a short memory, had some excuse for forgetting all it had read about \\"Tell England\\" in the many moons that intervened between the announcement of the film's completion and the actual announcement of a date for its production. No useful purpose would be served by going into details respecting the various reports that were current anent this very unusual delay.England Is Told.Eventually Wardour Films, Limited, presented \\"Tell England,\\" described as a British Instructional Films, Ltd., production, directed by Anthony Asquith and Geoffrey Barkas, for a two weeks' season at the Palace Theatre, London. It was a fashionable first night, and the applause was of the well-mannered variety to be expected from such a gathering. Next morning the newspaper critics paid due tribute to the various good points of the picture—one of them who waxed eulogistic going so far as to say that the day of the war film is not past, \\"or at least it ought not to be so long as we can have produced and see in public such a magnificent and spirit-stirring picture of battle and its consequences.\\" \\"The picture reveals,\\" it was added, \\"the character of the Englishman in all its various phases as seen in wartime, in peace and at play, under stress and in storm. Radiant with the nobility of youth and manhood at its best, it never descends to catch-penny or sensational levels, but pursues a strong, purposeful course with singular sanity.\\" Compliments were also paid to the \\"realistically truthful and brilliantly arranged and photographed\\" spectacular scenes and the \\"clever and consistent characterization,\\" and Mr. Asquith and Mr. Barkas were congratulated upon \\"approaching a mastery of technique unsurpassed by any foreigner.\\" Here and there, however, there were discreet references to the questions which were supposed to have long agitated \\"the trade on the point of booking 'Tell England'\\"; and later on a critic who prides himself on his outspokenness was moved to do what he described as \\"telling the truth\\" about the picture. He said that as there had been so much argument about it he could not do otherwise than register the fact that he had been bored and was actually glad when it was all over.\\"Tell England,\\" if this deponent may be permitted to express a personal opinion, is an anachronism. It is an attempt to reconstitute in these post-war days a condition, a convention rather, which passed away durin the later years of the world struggle. Up to 1914 and for some time afterward the shibboleth that \\"Waterloo was won on the playing fields of Eton\\" was held in high honor in this country, especially among what used to be the governing classes of England. During the earlier period of the war the \\"public school boy\\" tradition ruled strong in the matter of commissions, and not a few men of proved capacity were \\"turned down\\" by committees of \\"dug-outs\\" in the War Office who held to the Baconian aphorism that \\"manners makyth man\\" so long as they could construe it to mean that \\"the public school boy manner\\" was the best qualification for an \\"officer and a gentleman.\\" The meaning attached in England to the term \\"public school\\" is, of course, very different from its American application. It was only during the later years of the war that hard necessity killed this peculiar form of snobbery, and it is a moot point whether it will ever rise like another phoenix from its ashes, for in these days most parents who had experience of wartime requirements are seriously questioning whether \\"the playing fields of Eton\\" are the best place on which their offspring can learn how to win the various kinds of Waterloos that are likely to confront them.The Public School Boy.Both in its book form and its film version Mr. Raymond's \\"Tell England\\" was and is a glorification of the \\"public school boy,\\" and even many of the critics who praise it most highly admit that \\"the public school element is somewhat overemphasized.\\" From all of which it may be gathered that exhibitors throughout the country, whose patrons are in the main recruited from the real and not the so-called public schools of Great Britain, have questioned whether Anthony Asquith's film, despite its other merits, would be a profitable booking.Practically the only point on which there seems to be unanimity in regard to the example of the use of the screen publicity shown in this country in \\"The Bat Whispers\\" is that the piece selected was peculiarly unsuitable for the purposes of a demonstration.British studios are working actively on a number of new productions, most of which have already been mentioned in this correspondence. British International Pictures are starting on a version of Bizet's \\"Carmen,\\" which, it is said, will not be merely a photographed sound-replica of the opera. This company will also produce an audible film of \\"The Maid of the Mountains,\\" a musical comedy of which the author was Frederick Lonsdale and in which Miss José Collins was the star. It is announced that Mr. Lonsdale will personally supervise the production, but it is not stated whether Miss Collins, whose health recently caused her temporary retirement from the stage, will be asked to sing the rôle in which she was so successful or not. Anthony Asquith is directing a version of Compton Mackenzie's novel \\"Carnival.\\" Alfred Hitchcock has started work on what it is stated will be Elstree's most ambitious work this season—a film called \\"Rich and Strange,\\" most of the scenes in which will have an Oriental setting. A camera man has been taking shots in Ceylon, and Mr. Hitchcock will himself go as far East as Cairo!\\"The Bells.\\"Donald Calthrop, who figured in many of the recent productions from Elstree, but only in subsidiary parts since his successful appearance in \\"Blackmail,\\" has parted company with the organization which hitherto employed him, and will undertake the leading rôle in a version of \\"The Bells,\\" Henry Irving's great success, which is to be done by Associated Sound Film Industries. Mr. Calthrop will have several capable actors in his supporting cast.Last but not least in the record of British production, C. B. Cochran has definitely made up his mind to transfer some of his activities from the stage to the screen, and he will begin work in this latter direction as soon as may be with a version of Noel Coward's musical comedy \\"Bitter Sweet,\\" which, with Miss Peggy Wood, an American actress, playing the leading rôole, has had a record run at His Majesty's Theatre. Mr. Cochran's start in the screen version will be Miss Evelyn Laye, who took Miss Peggy Wood's part during the latter's absence in the United States.

The latest disk releases just about run the gamut of this repertory, from Bach and Vivaldi, through the Romantic warhorses, to the early 20th-century works of Prokofiev. At the same time, these new disks -some of them historical reissues -offer an array of stylistic approaches that can coexist peacefully in any collection.   The most fashionable approach at the moment and the one best suited for the music it addresses is the style that demands the use of original instruments and techniques in order to present the music as it was heard in its own time. Of course, despite the efforts of scholarship and leaving partisan sentiments aside, there is no single, universally accepted gauge of authenticity","excerpt":"and within the early music world, one can find interpretations of standard works that are more dramatically varied than an equivalent number of modern instruments renditions.

The impossible story makes one think of a budding chorus girl's dream of success. The Siren is indubitably attractive. She has expressive brown eyes, touched-up lashes and emphatically pursed lips. She is calculating and cold, being apparently aware that the men she encounters are extremely susceptible to a fleeting glance from her half-open eyes. Her charms are enhanced by many gowns in which the note of simplicity is absent.The settings in this film are unquestionably elaborate, perhaps beyond the hopes of the most ambitious chorus girl. Isabella Echevaria, the Siren, delights in posing on a chaise-longue, while her male secretary and her maid attend to her slightest whim. Her bed is on a pedestal, to which there are three steps, and mirrors are everywhere in her room, as she does not wish to miss an opportunity to study her graceful poses.Just a trifling resistance on the part of one man brings this imperious person to her knees. Actually it seems impossible for any woman so fond of herself to possess a vulnerable point in her heart. She strides up the path toward the portals of the French hotel, garbed in flowing white, with a long stick in her right hand. Slowly she flings glances at the men, and one poor chap is seized with incurable infatuation. He tosses a rose to her, and the dazzling Siren treads upon it, which action brought to mind the lines:\\"Sweet thou hast trod on a heart, Pass, there's a world full of men","excerpt":"And women as fair as thou art, Must do such things now and again.Stupidly the afflicted one follows the charmer upstairs. It is true that she had not called him, having merely looked with those half-open eyes in his direction. Suddenly realizing his infatuation means nothing in this Siren's life, he pulls out his pistol and puts a bullet through his head. The Siren afterward calmly asks:\\"How dare you allow people kill themselves at my door?\\"A little thing like a suicide is forgotten in a few minutes, and soon Isabella is quite herself again. She meets John Strong, from whom she had fled. He is a harsh person, now not at all pleasing to the Siren. She dines with him, but lets her eyes fall upon Gerald Rexford, an eminently respectable Englishman dining with his mother. Isabella tells Strong that she would like her shawl, and he goes for it. The Siren had signaled her desire to meet Rexford in the gardens, and as soon as Strong disappears she dawdles forth and soon is embracing Rexford. There's a lot of kissing in this picture, and some of it is not particularly well done.When the Siren thinks that she will snuff out her own life, she suddenly remembers that she met Rexford in a satin gown. Hence she goes forth to change it before taking poison. What could her world say if she severed this mortal coil in an unbecoming gown!Conway Tearle is only fair as the hero. Harry Morey figures as Strong. He is rather stagey in many of his poses. Clifton Webb gives a thorough and amusing characterization in the rôle of Maxim, Isabella's secretary. Miss La Marr gave her usual performance. THE SCREEN; A Cold Siren."},{"year":"2002","title":"GLUCK-Lillian S. (nee Saltzman). On May 23, 2002. Beloved daughter of the late Morris and Edna Saltzman.

Shylock is allowed to say too much on his own behalf, and the Christians are too often permitted to expose their opportunism and avarice, for the earlier play to be bluntly dismissed as anti-Semitic propaganda. And Shakespeare opens ''Henry V'' by suggesting that the great Agincourt campaign was inspired by Machiavellian churchmen, who saw in it a way of deflecting legislation that would rob them of revenues; he goes on to show the fear, the resentment, the cynicism and the rapacity to be found in the ranks of the conquering army; and in the very last sentence of the play he reminds the audience that Henry VI promptly lost everything his father had so painfully gained in France. ''The surface meaning is certainly that Agincourt was a lovely war,'' the dramatist John Arden once wrote, ''but there are so many corrections of this view in the structure that one is forced to wonder if the author had not written a secret play within the public one.''

From the beginning, he tells us in STRAIGHT UP OR ON THE ROCKS: A Cultural History of American Drink (Simon & Schuster, $18), this was a tippling country. The colonists displayed a knack for experimentation and improvisation, making alcoholic drink from \\"anything that would ferment.\\" Beer, cider and especially rum were consumed with gusto and in a myriad of combinations with other ingredients. As America pushed westward, rum gave way to whisky, and the national appetite increased. Liquor was considered a health-giving beverage, and, Mr. Grimes reports, \\"At least one 19th-century insurance company imposed a surcharge on abstainers, regarded as weak and weedy, and unquestionably a bad health risk.\\" The 19th century saw the rise of the saloon and the emergence of bartending as an honorable and highly respected profession. The later part of the century saw the birth of most of the classic cocktails -- including the martini, the manhattan and the old-fashioned. Prohibition \\"turned a lot of beer and wine drinkers into whisky drinkers.\\" Gin, once a drink for down-and-outers, became \\"the spirit of the age.\\" The period following Repeal has been, in the author's view, \\"a dreary saga of industry consolidation, mass marketing of image, and anxious trend-watching. The cocktail has suffered as a result.\\" And what is the prognosis for the future of the cocktail? Mr. Grimes finds hope in two disparate groups: immigrants, rum and tequila drinkers who may \\"impart new vigor\\" to the cocktail","excerpt":"and yuppies, whose status-seeking insistence on \\"the best\\" disdains the blandness of blended whiskies and watery beers.

They claim a game should be won solely on physical merits, sheer talent, and perhaps a lucky bounce. But games are played in the mind every bit as much as with the body.

The picture was first reviewed for American readers in an article in The Freeman by Herman George Scheffauer, which was reprinted in part in these columns on Nov. 28 last. Mr. Scheffauer, who saw the photoplay in Berlin, noted its \\"bizarre expressionistic form\\" and described its action as taking place in a \\"cubistic world of intense relief and depth.\\" He considered it important, however, not so much because of its cubism as because in it space had been \\"given a voice,\\" had \\"become a presence.\\"The picture was also seen in Berlin by Arthur Ziehm, a dealer in foreign films, who has written the following account of it:\\"From the viewpoint of effect on their audience, the authors of 'The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari' had the advantage of treating the subject of madness. Granting their mad premise, the story works itself out logically and remorselessly to the final sane ending. While original both in inspiration and interpretation. 'The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari' strikes a pitch akin to that heard in the stories of Hoffmann, Poe, Fitx James O'Brien and Ambrose Bierce. It should be said that while the interpretation has added immeasurably to the photoplay, yet the profounder reason for the thrill which it awakens lies in the actual story of Dr. Caligari.\\"That story is told through the lips of a madman, and it is in catching his twisted conceptions that the scenic artists have done notable things. The sets are a little mad. Everything is awry, somewhere","excerpt":"and, because it is almost impossible just to lay your fingers on the place, the sets add to the atmosphere of mystery and terror which permeates the picture. Recently I saw Mr. Jones's 'Macbeth'; the difference between his work in that play and the work done in Caligari is simply that Mr. Jones failed—this time—and the artists in the photoplay succeeded. The sets in the picture do not blacken your eye with their aggression or box your ears with their abruptness. They are subtly woven into the tale of Dr. Caligari.\\"\\"Since the picture is to be shown in New York, it would not be right to give away the secret behind it, thus robbing it, for those who read this article, of its element of surprise. However, a few general outlines can be given. The picture opens in a garden, with two men talking. One of them remarks that he feels the presence in the air of evil things from the past. A woman, pale, and dressed completely in white, passes; the other man tells the first speaker that the woman is his fiancée, and assures him that, whatever his experiences in the past, they cannot equal those endured by himself and his sweetheart. The scene fades out in old-time movie fashion and fades into the story which is being told in the garden.\\"This story within the story is laid in a little provincial town with a half-medieval aspect. Everything has an air of old worldliness, from the student who throws away his book when he hears of the fair to the fair itself and the old men and young men and old women and young women who throng it. Furthermore, everything has an air of exaggeration which makes the characters seem unreal as human beings, but extraordinarily real as embodying qualities of goodness and evil, peace and terror.\\"Dr. Caligari, who embodies sheer wickedness, is a masterly conception, and the work of Mr. Krauss in this rôle will, undoubtedly, arouse as much comment and enthusiasm in America as it did in Europe. The doctor is an elderly man who wears a cape and a battered top hat, while behind his eyeglasses are strange, roving eyes. In the conception of the man who is telling the tale he does evil for the sheer delight that it affords him. This monster reaches the town when the fair is being held and solicits from the town clerk permission to exhibit a somnambulist on the ground. The permission is granted, but not without rudeness on the part of the clerk. That night the unfortunate man is murdered in his bed.\\"This is the beginning of a mysterious sequence of crimes. The hero—the story-teller—tells of how he visited the doctor's booth with a friend when the doctor, opening a huge, standing cabinet, revealed an immensely tall and skinny man, fast asleep. This creature is completely under the domination of the doctor. He sleeps until awakened by Caligari, and when awake obeys his master implicitly.\\"The showman invites the audience to have their fortunes told by the awakened sleeper and the creature predicts to the friend of the story-teller that he will not live beyond tomorrow's dawn. Next day he is found murdered in his bed. In all the murders a strange, dagger-like weapon is used, so that there is no doubt that they are all the work of one man. Eventually the sweetheart of the hero is threatened with the hatred of the old wretch and from this point onward the story moves to an unguessed-at climax.\\"It is obvious that a synopsis of such a story cannot convey the flavor of the actual vehicle. 'The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari' represents to me something very real and terrible. Do you remember the fear that you felt when you were a guest in 'The House of Usher'? The story of Caligari is entirely dissimilar, yet awakens the same kind of fear—that fear of things having no reason and loving evil instinctively.\\"\\"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\\" was written by Carl Mayer and Hans Janowitz; it was directed by Robert Wien, and its scenic designers were H. Worm, Walter Reiman and Walter Rork, according to the announcement from the Capitol. Mr. Scheffauer, in his article in The Freeman, credited it chiefly to \\"Walter Reiman, Walther Röhrig and Hermann Warm.\\" A CUBISTIC SHOCKER"},{"year":"1993","title":"Long a television staple but somewhat neglected in recent years amid the rush to half-hour sitcoms, crime drama has become prime time's most forceful link with reality, especially that of the contemporary urban scene.

It was photographed about three years ago by Carl von Hoffman, and while it is a species of travelogue it is far more entertaining than rowdy comedies and extravagant fistic battles. Mr. von Hoffman goes from Cairo to the Cape in this adventure and his study of the natives in various stages of his journey is informative.In this pictorial effort Mr. von Hoffman reveals the queer dances of some of the tribes and he also gives one a conception of his difficulties at times in using his camera. Some of the men and women looked upon the apparatus as an evil box, but they gathered that nothing was happening if the operator looked in an opposite direction while he was turning the handle. On the other hand, some of the savages rather welcomed the camera, which they imagined could even disclose their mental processes.This film, which, incidentally, is entitled \\"Jungle Gods,\\" illustrates some amazing hunt dances, where the natives become so hysterical that killing is but a mere formality. In these scenes the hunters trail the \\"lions,\\" and the savages who play the beasts wear lions' heads over their own. When they are caught these \\"lions\\" quickly snatch off their disguise, for it is explained that any delay might mean that the \\"lion\\" would be slain by some overzealous hunter.SELECTING the \\"Gentlemen of the Jury\\" received careful consideration in the film version of the play \\"Chicago.\\" Determined to present a typical group of \\"twelve good men and true\\" in the climactic courtroom scenes, Frank Urson spent days prior to the start of production in casting these twelve parts.

Anybody who has seen recent Chaplin movies, especially the miraculous \\"A Countess From Hong Kong,\\" knows that he writes the loveliest kitsch background music since the Oskar Straus waltzes that graced the great Max Ophuls films of the early 1950's.\\"The Circus\\" discovers Charlie, in the person of the Little Tramp, standing hungry outside a traveling circus, and it leaves him, sitting in the ring, after the circus itself has pulled away. In between, Charlie joins the circus as roustabout, saves it with the humor of his monumental ineptitude, falls in love with the circus owner's daughter (Merna Kennedy), and loses her to the handsome tightrope walker — whose suit he bravely promotes. The theme of unhappy romance is not unusual in the major Chaplin films, though it is treated with less circumstance and much less pathetic detail in \\"The Circus\\" than in, say, \\"The Gold Rush\\" or \\"City Lights\\"—both of which enjoy accidental happy endings that are more gracious than gratuitous.The exemplary renunciation at the end of this film essentially begs an appreciation of what the Little Tramp stands for and what, despite his deserts, he is likely to get.But the image of the circus itself, an arena partly intended for comic performance, is a little unusual. Chaplin works very hard not to exploit it.As a circus employe he succeeds at everything except comedy. He services the animals, moves the props","excerpt":"and, even in a pinch, walks the high wire (the film's great climactic routine, and as prodigiously funny as anything in Chaplin), but he never makes it as a clown, and all the laughs are, from Charlie's point of view, unintentional.Even the regular circus clowns are unfunny, which is why Charlie is hired in the first place—to get laughs without meaning to. That group of clowns, seen in medium long shot, tumbling, jumping, running, working like crazy in the ring, but to no avail, are for me the most mysterious and moving image in the film. Everything in Chaplin's circus militates against good times. Acts fail, the owner beats his daughter and denies her food, the property men quit because they are not paid—and the ring itself displays failure, pain and frustration.Charlie succeeds, in effect, by disrupting the circus—by interrupting the acts, exposing the secrets of magician's prop table (another great comic routine), running to escape a normally placid donkey that charges madly every time it sees him. Therefore the circus functions much like any other Chaplin locale that Charlie divides to conquer. But at the same time it is meant to keep much of its traditional sentimental weight and even some of its handy metaphorical significance. \\"The Circus\\" is very knowledgeable about its world, but I don't think it is very deeply committed to it. At the end, the Little Tramp sits alone in the tentless ring. The circus wagons have all vanished in a cloud of dust—a really speedy desertion. A memento of his beloved lies in the dirt at his feet, and only sky and suburban scrubland surrounds him.A call to emotion is at hand, but at least in me, the response is not forthcoming. We have too often throughout the film, in the spaces between the great set pieces, glimpsed the mind behind the matter, and now we confront not so much the pathos of the situation as the careful promotion of a well-beloved institution.

Predictions of the kind have often enough been falsified to make it unnecessary to credit the latest claims unreservedly, but at any rate they deserve to be given some measure of attention by the protagonists of American production. The head of one of the largest distributing companies in this country is on record as having stated that during next year his organization will show nearly 50 per cent of British films, which is a very considerable advance on the percentage shown during the year now drawing to a close.During the past fortnight the British output has been almost record-breaking, so far as mere numbers are concerned","excerpt":"and, generally speaking, there has been a noticeable improvement in the standards of quality. We have yet to see the \\"great talking film destined to conquer the entire English-speaking world, one that will sweep the dominions like a flame and take even America by storm\\"; but according to one enthusiast this phenomenon is now in the making, or, to be more exact, in the cutting stages in a version of Mr. A. A. Milne's play \\"Michael and Mary,\\" in which Mr. Herbert Marshall and his wife, Miss Edna Best, appear under the direction of Mr. Victor Saville.Fine Performances.Even if \\"Michael and Mary\\" fails to come up to the epochal mark assigned to it, both Mr. Marshall and Miss Best can be expected to give a distinguished interpretation of their rôles. They have just appeared together in a new picture entitled \\"The Calendar,\\" based on a play by Mr. Edgar Wallace, which is being given a first run at the Capitol in the Haymarket. Marshall's performance is as outstanding in its way as that of Mr. Gordon Harker's enactment of the rôle of an ex-convict ex-batman is in an entirely different style. Marshall is suggestive; Harker has a tendency to overact; but as a result of their combined efforts \\"The Calendar\\" is first-class entertainment. The producing company is Gainsborough-British Lion, an amalgamation resulting from the parlous times of recent memory.The atmosphere is as English as the most patriotic of this country's filmgoers could desire. There is a happy combination of actual scenes at Royal Ascot, such as shots of the enclosure and the semi-state procession of the King and Queen up the course and racing for the Gold Cup and Vase of the famous meeting, and the incidents required for the telling of Mr. Wallace's story, which, for its part, is among his most successful efforts. Miss Anne Gray in the rôle of a siren not only looks attractive but wears much better clothes than English film actresses are usually supplied with and in a diaphanous dressing gown is quite a fine figure of a woman—one of the finest shown in a British film.In importance of production, \\"Carnival,\\" which Herbert Wilcox has directed for British and Dominions, takes a higher rank than \\"The Calendar,\\" but it is questionable whether it will prove as popular. It is adapted for the screen from Compton Mackenzie's play, and scenically offers scope and opportunity such as could not be encompassed on the stage. Matheson Lang, who is in the first rank of English actors, plays the rôle of a jealous husband with the restrained fury and passion only to be expected from so capable an artist; but somehow or other his personality on the screen does not \\"get over\\" as well as it does when there are footlights only between him and his audience. Miss Dorothy Bourchier, who was once known as Chili and was supposed to be full of \\"It,\\" is Mr. Wilcox's \\"find\\" for the part of the wife who, in the glamour and riot of carnival time, is tempted to betray her husband but doesn't. She wears a scarcity of costume attractively enough, but there is a tendency to hilarity in the audience when she explains to her husband that she had been on the point of being carried away but hadn't because, at the crucial moment, her carnival swain had been, she declares, \\"carried away by his passions\\" and she had seen him as he really was.A Humorless Film.Apart from this, there is no humor in \\"Carnival.\\" Probably Mr. Wilcox didn't think humor necessary in a picture where he depends for his effects upon pleasing the eye only; but some of his spectacular fireworks might have been sacrificed with advantage for the sake of making some appeal to the mind's eye. Directorial genius must comprise more than a passion for photography, and not for one moment do the actors in \\"Carnival\\" seem to be real flesh and blood. Joseph Schildkraut (whose acting in \\"Liliom\\" made him an American favorite) was cast for the rôle of Count Andrea, the lover whose passions betrayed him, and while Matheson Lang has not added to his reputation by this film, he has not lowered it as Mr. Schildkraut has done, chiefly, it must be stated, because of the nebulous elements of characterization placed at his disposal.Incidentally it may be worth mention that Matheson Lang is reported to have been paid the highest salary ever obtained from a film producing company in this country, his emoluments mounting to four figures in pounds sterling per week. Another fact which indicates that Herbert Wilcox does not hesitate to spend money when he thinks it is a case of casting bread upon the waters so that it shall come back in dough is that the first showing of \\"Carnival\\" to the press and the trade was prefaced by an expensive luncheon at a leading hotel. When the champagne had ceased to flow the restaurant was more or less successfully transformed into a cinema and the film shown to an audience whose postprandial enthusiasm does not appear to have been of a very lasting quality. The eulogies which some of the newspaper critics heaped upon \\"Carnival\\" when they came away from its première in a Park Lane hotel were considerably toned down after its public presentation at the Tivoli. The superlative lapsed into the positive to a degree which almost suggested a realization of the Napoleonic dictum that between the sublime and the ridiculous is but a step. The Tivoli is one of the best testing houses in the West End of London, and by the length of its run there it will be possible to gauge the popular entertainment value of an ambitious effort to show that Elstree is not far behind Hollywood in classical production.Another ambitious attempt to create a film classic has been even less successful in the case of an adaptation of \\"Carmen\\" which leaves one doubtful whether the presentation owes more to the original story by Prosper Mérimèe or to the musical setting of the story by Bizet. This is a British International production directed by Mr. Cecil Lewis, whose indubitable talents are generally supposed to have been \\"cabined, cribbed and confined\\" by George Bernard Shaw when that great man decided that it was time for him to show the protagonists of cinematic art the error of their ways. It was Mr. Lewis whom Mr. Shaw selected as his technical expert for the production of \\"How He Lied to Her Husband.\\"\\"Gipsy Blood.\\"Arthur Dent, who saw the possibilities in a screen presentation of \\"Carmen,\\" arrived, by some ingenious mental processes, at the conclusion that \\"Gipsy Blood\\" would be a better film title, and so the Mérimée-Bizet collaboration, or combination rather, is offered to the public under a name by which nobody will recognize it. Instead of being asked to renew our acquaintance with an old and well-loved friend we are bidden to hail a newcomer whom we at once recognize as somebody masquerading under a name which ill befits him. It has been suggested that the changing of titles of subjects of world-wide fame offers plenty of scope for producers, and that probably filmgoers would like \\"The Merchant of Venice\\" if it were billed as \\"His Pound of Flesh,\\" a comedy-drama by Will Shaka-da-Spear.Apart from futile considerations of that sort, \\"Gipsy Blood\\" possesses some merits. Dr. Malcolm Sargent has \\"arranged\\" the music of Georges Bizet, and somebody else has \\"edited\\" the story by Mérimée, and lyrics have been written by a knowledgable young woman, and Thomas Burke and Miss Marguerite Namara have been engaged to sing the old airs; and the result is declared to be \\"seductive! fascinating! ! pulsating with the passion of Spanish blood! ! !\\" As a film, \\"Gipsy Blood\\" may satisfy the unfortunates who have never heard \\"Carmen\\" on the operatic stage. But how the shades of the long procession of Carmens and Don Josés and toreadors who have enraptured the world for over a century past must be lamenting!New Producing Firm.A new company has come into the field with a picture entitled \\"Captivation.\\" This company, which is called John Harvel Productions, has as its manager Mr. John Stafford, who has Hollywood experience. Mr. Godfrey Tearle and Miss Violet Vanburgh, both of whom have an admirable stage record, were impressed into the service of the new company, which declares it will do better next time.\\"The Happy Ending,\\" a version of Ian Hay's comedy, which has been shown at the New Gallery, calls for mention only because it is a vocal rendering of a silent film starring Miss Benita Hume, who is one of Hollywood's latest captures. Both Miss Hume and Mr. George Barraud give performances of considerable merit. The spectacular part of the production, a shipwreck in midocean, shows how far British production has advanced in technique since the days of the \\"silents.\\"Time Will Tell.Whether or not this catalogue of recent British production justifies the leit-motif of confident expectation for the future noted in recent chronicles remains to be seen. However, it is significant that British International plans to make one feature film each week of 1932, that Gaumont-British count on turning out forty films during the same period, and that other organizations are speeding up. It is also significant that American firms like Paramount, Metro-Goldwyn, Warner and Universal have got busy on British locations at Elstree, Teddington and Cricklewood.

It has Puccini's opera at its heart and Jan Kiepura and Marta Eggerth to sing its loveliest arias, but, beyond that, it has strength of its own and the gif of weaving Puccini, singers, cast and sub-plot into a sadsweet romance which must be called one of the most impressive of our cinema operas.Although it uses the wheel-within-a-wheel formula, creating a real-life parallel to the opera which shadows the lives of its players, it cloaks its transitions so cleverly that one cannot say where Puccini's fancy leaves off and the film's fact begins, or whether it owes more of its drama to the composer than it does to its script writer. In other words, the story of \\"La Bohème\\" and the story of the picture's René and Denise have been so closely interwoven that, for the film's purposes, they stand as one—equally harmonious, equally tragic.Consequently, it would be to cavil at Puccini as much as at the scriptwriter to dismiss, as old hat, the plaintive legend of the girl who tried to protect her sweetheart from the pain of discovering she was mortally ill.

In 1931 Sergei M. Eisenstein, the famous Russian director, had gone to Mexico to film what he presumably intended as an epic study of the Mexican people, the title of which was to have been \\"Que Viva Mexico.\\" But for reasons variously disputed, Eisenstein never cut and edited the vast and assorted footage which he gathered","excerpt":"and, in 1933, when Upton Sinclair presented a picture culled from this celluloid mass under the title of \\"Thunder Over Mexico,\\" there were persons around and about who hotly held it didn't follow at all the intentions of Eisenstein.Well, a lot of water has gone under the bridge since then, so a more dispassionate view is therefore likely to be taken of Marie Seton's latest reworking of the Eisenstein material. And furthermore, Miss Seton, who is a British journalist, claims that the director himself outlined the rough scenario that she followed in editing this second version, called \\"Time in the Sun,\\" which opened at the Fifth Avenue Playhouse yesterday. So the boldness of her endeavor will probably cause neither riots nor bloodshed.As a matter of fact, from this distance, the earlier controversy seems slightly foolish, and the film which Miss Seton has produced from the couple of hundred thousand feet which Eisenstein shot is probably as good a picture as could be distilled into a reasonable length. Basically, it is documentary in nature—a magnificently photographed account of Mexican native life which attempts to get beneath mere externals to spiritual forces. For, whereas \\"Thunder Over Mexico\\" was concerned mainly with the question of peonage, \\"Time in the Sun\\" visualizes the inherence of a free, pagan spirit which has survived in the Mexican native, despite Spanish civilization and slavery. From the Mayan ruins in Yucatan, it traces the evidence of this spirit through the nature and customs of the people which have continued for centuries, and concludes with a spectacular display of the Mexican's attitude toward death.Many technical faults are obvious in \\"Time in the Sun\\": it does not flow smoothly, its construction seems contrived and the main idea is conveyed more in narration than in picture. But the photography of E. Tisse is so stunning and of such dramatic strength that each individual shot offers an exciting experience. This, we feel, is the chief distinction of the film—this, and the fact that it should make an end to the \\"Que Viva Mexico\\" controversy.

The bearded artist today may look like a British naval officer in plain clothes, but as man and painter he has passed much of his life as an outlaw doing time in prison as well as at the Royal College of Art (in that order) and, since settling in the United States, getting away with his own version of esthetic murder.   History will probably not put Morley in the top drawer of art revolutionaries, but it has already credited him with anticipating Photo-Realism by a few years and Neo-Expressionism by about a decade. His work, nevertheless, resists exact categorization: for instance, the large-scale 1960's replicas of picture postcards have intimations of painterliness and, sometimes, a childlike truculence","excerpt":"and, lacking a gift for histrionics, the artist has generally been more Expressionist than Neo-. In short, viewers, including his numerous critical supporters, have never really known where they are with the wayward Morley, and the oils and watercolors of the last two years that are now at Xavier Fourcade Inc., 36 East 75th Street, are unlikely to change the situation.

Bass, often called the Father of Marketing Science, died on December 1, 2006 at his home. At age 79, he was in his 25th year as a professor of marketing science in the School of Management at the University of Texas at Dallas. Professor Bass' research and that of his students was pivotal in establishing marketing as a quantitative science. Dr. Bass was a native of Cuero, Texas. He received his PhD from the University of Illinois (1954) after earning an MBA from The University of Texas at Austin (1950) and a BBA from Southwestern University (1949). He served in the U.S. Navy from 1944-1946 in Okinawa. After his MBA degree, Dr. Bass spent a year with the wholesale pharmaceutical distributor, McKesson & Robbins, where he asked myriad questions about marketing that could not be answered. When he realized that no one, either in industry or academia, knew the answers he sought, he decided to become a professor with the goal of doing research to find the answers himself. From that moment, until his death, he searched for mathematical theories that could be proven by testing with measurements (data) in order to provide answers to fundamental questions in marketing. The mathematical and statistical models he developed of generalized marketing phenomena are among the most widely used in the world. Dr. Bass held professorships at the University of Illinois, Champagne - Urbana (1951 54), The University of Texas (1954-1957) and later The Ohio State University. Because of his distinguished research record, he was invited to join a very select group at Harvard University as a fellow for the 1959-1960 Institute of Basic Mathematics for Application to Business. That year, which was sponsored by the Ford Foundation with the goal of improving management education, had a significant impact on Dr. Bass' career, and, in turn, the marketing profession. Dr. Bass joined the faculty at Purdue University in 1961, and in 1974 became the Loeb Distinguished Professor of Management at Purdue's Krannert School of Management. In 1982 Professor Bass left Purdue, one of the worlds leading management schools, for the challenge in his beloved home state of Texas of helping to build the University of Texas at Dallas (UTD) School of Management into a world-class research institution. At UTD he held the prestigious Eugene McDermott Chair. One of Dr. Bass' many landmark achievements came when he developed a remarkably accurate marketing model that tracks the sales of durable goods. The moedl has been extensively applied and scores of academic careers and hundreds of research papers have been based on the Bass Model. His 1969 Bass Model paper was named by The Institute for Operations Research and Management Sciences as one of the Top Ten Most Influential Papers published in the 50 year history of management science. Dr. Bass thought that someday his most important contribution might be viewed as his 1974 paper on stochastic brand choice. In it he showed that consumers' choices cannot be predicted on an individual basis, but only probabilistically. Just as Heisenbergs uncertainty principle in physics established that simultaneous position and momentum of a subatomic particle cannot be measured to arbitrary precision no matter how good the measuring instruments, Dr. Bass' research showed that for brand choices consumers brains have a stochastic element","excerpt":"and, no matter how much data one gathers on a customer, a particular instance of his or her choice of a brand cannot be predicted deterministically. Dr. Bass was one of the first marketing scholars to apply econometric methods in developing statistical estimates of the effects of advertising, promotions, and prices upon sales. His research in marketing econometrics and that of his intellectual descendants include seminal works in the field. In 1972-75 Professor Bass served as the Editor of the preeminent journal in marketing --the Journal of Marketing Research. His international stature grew as a pioneer in management sciences when in 1978-79 he served as president of the Institute of Management Sciences. He later co-founded Marketing Science, arguably the most prestigious quantitative marketing journal in the field today. Dr. Bass won numerous awards for his research including the American Marketing Association's 1979 William Odell Award, the 1986 Paul D. Converse Award, the 2002 Gilbert A. Churchill, Jr. Award and the Charles Coolidge Parlin Award for Outstanding Contributions to Marketing Research. Professor Bass has received honorary doctorates from Purdue University, The Ohio State University and the University of South Australia. In his honor the University of Groningen in The Netherlands has created a special chair and the University of South Australia has created the Ehrenberg-Bass Institute for Marketing Science. The University Texas at Dallas has established the Frank M. Bass Institute of Marketing Science. Dr. Bass inspired his students and colleagues with his passion for beautiful mathematical models of marketing phenomena but, absolutely insisted that a model is only as good as the empirical testing it has undergone. Dr. Bass was fundamentally a scientist with the same passion, the same mathematics and the same desire to find truth as other great scientists such as Newton and Einstein. As other scientists who have launched new scientific disciplines, Professor Bass sought to see the face of God in understanding the beauty of how the world of marketing works. He understood that marketing and business are as fundamental to humankind as physics in that it is through business that we humans create practical products and services for each other to improve our lives, accelerate our evolution and increase our creativity and satisfaction. He thought no small ideas. Dr. Bass was preceded in death by his first wife Annie Laurie Bass and is survived by his wife Portia Isaacson Bass, his son Douglas Bass, his step-sons Allen Isaacson and John Isaacson and seven grandchildren.

It is that of an unmistakable B buzzing like an A. If his \\"Rio\\" (at the Globe), like his \\"Let Us Live\\" of last season, is not a complete triumph of directorial mind over routine plot matter, it represents its victory in a few skirmishes at least. Better still, it represents an effort of a new director to break away from the established pattern and try something new. On that count alone we must endorse it.Mr. Brahm's direction recalls one of Alfred Hitchcock's pet ideas. Hitch once said he would like to make a Keystone Kop comedy with the burlesque kops running out of a building and being felled, one by one as they cross the threshold, by the comedy hero's comedy club. Only Hitch's notion was to interrupt his slapstick sequence, after six or eight of the Kops had gone down, by showing a close-up of the seventh victim, his head bloody, his eyes tragically reflecting his pain, and moving from there to a sequence about the fallen kop's home—his grief-bowed wife, the brood of children weeping as the no longer comic Kop is carried upstairs.Brahm has done something like that. His tale, on its externals, is simply the old melodramatic one of an arch-swindler sent to a French penal colony, escaping at last and returning to threaten his innocent young wife's hope of romantic happiness. The usual course is to tell it as swiftly as possible, stencilling in the characters instead of drawing them, exploiting the penal colony's horrors, lingering with melodramatic relish over the final scene among husband, wife and lover, Mr. Brahm, with his writer's and cast's assistance, has handled it another way, building characterization, avoiding the obvious whenever that is possible and digging beneath the externals for psychological elements of suspense and drama.He has not succeeded completely, which was to be expected, but he has achieved a handful of exceptionally telling sequences","excerpt":"and, through the performances of Basil Rathbone, Sigrid Gurie, Robert Cummings and Victor McLaglen in roles quite unlike those they usually play, he has created a character gallery of constant interest. We could have done with less of Miss Gurie's singing and an unduly prolonged festival sequence. But we can do with a great deal more of the originality Mr. Brahm is bringing to the screen's least original field, the B-picture.

In fact, it succeeded in making hundreds laugh at a late performance on Saturday. Nevertheless, considering what Ernst Lubitsch did with \\"The Love Parade\\" it is disappointing to observe M. Chevalier with a millstone of a story. The small mercy for which to be thankful is that no sequence in this offering sinks to the depths of his first screen adventure. \\"Innocents of Paris.\\"In this present picture M. Chevalier impersonates Pierre Mirande, an impoverished Parisian aristocrat, who at the beginning of the story is earning a few francs by acting as courier for Mr. Billings, an American chewing gum magnate, his wife and daughter. On the moon-lit Grande Canal in Venice, Pierre and Barbara Billings admit their great affection for each other. Then the irascible old Billings has to be told something about it and he is much averse to his daughter wedding a foreigner.Barbara, however, has a will of her own and she eventually prevails upon her father to give Pierre a job in his chewing gum factory. So, after a scene or two in the uninviting place where Pierre has the privileges of a hall room and having his meals with a grotesque group, the young alien is beheld at work, under one Pat O'Day, in the factory. Once Pierre had tasted chewing gum, but he disliked it. He likes it less after the first day's work, for O'Day, carrying out Billings's instructions, is not exactly making things pleasant for the Frenchman.After a few days of toil, Pierre is due one evening at a dinner given by the Billingses, having been invited, of course, by Barbara. Pierre doffs his factory clothes and eventually arrays himself in immaculate evening dress. He rests his weary limbs upon his hard bed and falls asleep. When his eyes open night has passed and the sun is illuminating his humble room. Pierre asks of a tiny servant girl, \\"Is it tomorrow?\\" She tells him that it is today.Barbara is peeved with Pierre for missing the dinner and still more so when Pierre pays too much attention to business, for be it known the Frenchman through an accident paves the way to a fortune for both himself and Mr. Billings. Just before the last scene vanishes, however, one is aware that there is going to be a highly successful international marriage.The cause of Pierre's sudden success is due in a measure to Pat O'Day, but chiefly to a bottle of whisky. O'Day asks Pierre to have a drink and the Parisian is not keen about it. As O'Day gets down the bottle from its hiding place in a file, he drops it and the liquid saturates valuable specimens of chewing gum. O'Day decides to make himself scarce, but Pierre picks up a piece of gum and in a moment of abstraction puts it into his mouth. He is amazed. It is delicious! Soon he is telling of his discovery to Billings, who senses the wonderful possibilities for gum flavored with Scotch, rye, bourbon and even champagne, the further chance of ruining bootleggers and making the land safe for chewing gum","excerpt":"and, what is paramount with Billings, making a mint of money.The smiling and affable Pierre soon is ensconced in a well-furnished office with some $20,000 a year as salary. In the course of his duties, he writes lyrics and composes tunes telling of the satisfaction that Scotch, bourbon and champagne chewing gum gives to thousands and how much safer, less expensive and more convenient it is than alcoholic liquids.M. Chevalier sings two songs during this adventure. The lyrics are a little clumsy, but the tunes are fairly good. Rendered by this inimitable Frenchman they are enjoyable. Claudette Colbert plays Barbara pleasingly, but through poor photography she does not look nearly as attractive as she is. George Barbier's voice thunders from the screen in a frightful fashion. Miss Colbert's lines were also frequently reproduced so loudly that the effect might only have appealed to a romantic boiler maker.A short comedy with Walter Hagen and Leo Diegel, the crack golfers, is also on the program. It is called \\"Match Play,\\" and was produced by Mack Sennett. There are some, interesting moments and others in which the comedy tumbles a peg or so too low for golf.

The latest of such adventures is \\"The Road to Romance,\\" an adaptation of Joseph Conrad's novel. \\"Romance,\\" which is at the Capitol Theatre. This production has been filmed with no little skill and earnestness, but it is occasionally lacking in clarity and is hardly as imaginatively directed as one might hope for.During the extraordinary experiences of José Armando, Serifina and the other characters, one is never blind to the fact that their destinies are being controlled by that power behind the camera, the director, rather than by the creative brain of the author. It is the film expert who says \\"Nay\\" to the sympathetic parties and \\"Yea\\" to the pirates","excerpt":"and, when the time comes, it is this same person who in a kindly fashion pulls the strings that release José and Serifina and ties ropes around the throats of the miscreants.The locale of this yarn is an island off the coast of Cuba, a spot found most convenient by a band of Pirates, who are welcomed by the archenemy of the Armando family, Balthasar. After Don Carlos breathes his last, Balthasar becomes even more daring, and were it not for the fact that José of Seville comes from Spain to Serifina's rescue, Balthasar would probably have succeeded in making Serifina his bride.But José only has plain sailing for a while, as his vessel is attacked by the pirates, and it is largely through his sleight-of-hand tricks and talent for amusing the scoundrels that he reaches Serifina. After experiences that have at least an exciting aspect, there is a title that reads:\\"Courage, child, José is here to take you to the ship.\\"It is addressed to Serifina, but even then, José finds that John Robertson, the director, does not intend that he shall get away in a small boat. He is perceived trying the Herculean task, but, unfortunately, the ship is blown up. José then escapes with Serifina to a cave, and Balthasar, well aware of José's indomitable spirit, decides to force the pair out of their retreat by having a feast at which wine flows freely. This might be all very well in ordinary circumstances, but José and Serifina haven't a drop of water wherewith to quench their thirst. However, the faithful one-armed Castro manages to elude the pirates and see that José and the girl have a bottle of water.Ramon Novarro, who plays the title role in \\"The Student Prince,\\" is active and handsome as José. Marceline Day does well as the distraught Serifina and Marc McDermott is competent as the pirate chief whose insignia of office is an old silk hat. Cesare Gravina almost makes the work of Castro look plausible.The surrounding program has several thoroughly entertaining numbers, including Pat Rooney, Marion Bent and Pat Rooney 3d.

By lacerating the tame and timid world of his parents Osborne became the daring, romantic voice of a new generation's rebellion.

Seeing it, one thinks of Charlie Chaplin's best work","excerpt":"and, while Chaplin and Harold Lloyd are undoubtedly funnier, in the sense of getting heartier laughter out of an audience, there is a mellowness and humanity in \\"It's a Great Life\\" that is not always present in the work of either of the great farceurs.The story is laid at a boys' boarding school, and concerns the adventures of one Stoddard III., his dreams and his love affairs. His pal, \\"the Wop,\\" finds a small pearl in an oyster at Small's eating house, and his imagination, fired by this simple fuel, immediately plans an exploring trip to the Solomon Islands with his hero, Stoddard. Much of the film is taken up with their schemes for the great adventure and pictures of their imaginary triumphs, with Stoddard as King and \\"the Wop\\" as Prime Minister.Upon this slender thread of a main plot hang others—the head-master's ultimatum to Stoddard, \\"If you get five more demerits you're expelled,\\" and Stoddard's frantic efforts to escape the dread five; his scandalous treatment at the hands of the fair Lucille, who has not written to him for three weeks and two days; his surrender to the charms of Eloise Graham, the head-master's daughter; his rescue by main force at the hands of his disguised confederate, and the disastrous results of eating three dozen oysters in an attempt to find another pearl.None of this sounds particularly adventuresome or \\"plotty.\\" Nor it is. \\"It's a Great Life \\"is a striking example of a truth that many motion picture producers might ponder to advantage—that if you present life, real life, on the screen, the interest of your story will take care of itself. The scenario is an excellent piece of work, with titles that really help the story and that actually read the way people talk.Nor is the acting less good. Cullen Landis, as Stoddard; and Howard Halston, as \\"the Wop,\\" are all that could be desired; their illusion of \\"boy\\" is perfect. Molly Malone as Eloise, the infant vamp, is also excellent. The other members of the cast, none of whom is less than satisfactory, are Clara Horton, Otto Hoffman, Tom Persse, Ralph Bushman, E. J. Mack and John Lynch.Elsie Ferguson is the star at the Rivoli this week in a film version of Mrs. Humphrey Ward's novel, \\"Lady Rose's Daughter.\\" Burns Mantle's scenario provides for a double prologue to the story proper, giving Miss Ferguson a chance to appear not only as Julie le Breton, the heroine of the novel, but as Lady Maude, her grandmother, and Lady Rose, her mother. The chief interest of the film lies in Miss Ferguson's work rather than in the story, which, on the screen, reveals Mrs. Ward's shortcomings as an author rather disconcertingly.The story, that of the beautiful illegitimate daughter of a titled mother who left her crusty husband, and who in turn was the daughter of an equally titled mother who had left hers; the struggles of the ill-fated Julie to shake off her heritage of sin, her heartless treatment by her mother's relatives, her narrowly averted ruin at the hands of a fortune-hunting captain, and her final blissful surrender to the \\"good\\" lover, seems threadbare and Laura Jean Libbyish, although Mrs. Ward evidently took it very seriously. Miss Ferguson is, as always, a beautiful and appealing figure, and the sincerity and effectiveness of her acting make the film one of more than average interest. Her supporting cast is excellent, and includes David Powell, Holmes E. Herbert, Ida Waterman, Frank Losee, and Warren Cook.Charles Ray is at the Strand in a picturization of \\"Forty-five Minutes from Broadway,\\" one of the milestones on the upward march of Geoge M.

The tried&#8208","excerpt":"and&#8208;true boxes stuffed with soil and plants is a traditional way, but not the only way. Rock gardens will grow high above the city. The Kays have a luxuriant rock garden which thrives on a Manhattan terrace overlooking the East River. It is about 12 feet long and three feet deep at the widest part and provides them with a touch of rustic country. The scheme was designed and planted by The Potting Shed, which specializes in urban rock gardens. To start, the outline of the garden is layed on the brick terrace with fieldstone. Cement is nsed to fill in the pockets between the rocks and make a tight frame for the soil. This supports additional rocks and plants. Vermiculite is mixed with the potting soil and rocks are set back at an angle to guide drainage. This construction prevents seepage of soil and water onto the terrace. Evergreen perennial rock plants are used for their continual color and texture. Especially successful are echeverias, like hen&#8208;and&#8208;chickens and cobweb, sedums, thymes, pachysandra and some herbs. Dwarf rhododendrons and azaleas are often used. The chief maintenance required is light top watering plus some weeding. All of the plants are winter hardy and watering stops after the first frost when perennials become dormant. In spring after growth begins, some may need dividing.

For the study in terror and violence hews to its story line about a psychotic killer who holds a group of six hostages in fear and trembling, with pithy dialogue, realistic portrayals and, oddly enough, a spot of humor directed, of all things, at television.Turned out at what obviously was no great expense, \\"Dial 1119\\" represents a first effort in the feature-film field for director Gerald Mayer, who previously handled screen tests and short subjects. Mr. Mayor's stint is eminently professional except for a climax, which is full of the sight and sound of gunfire, but is routine, nevertheless. However, what transpires before is presented with mounting tension, as the killer, a youth who has escaped from a mental institution, returns to Terminal City to seek out and slay the police psychiatrist who had him committed.The menace of Gunther Wyckoff is heightened as he enters a bar across the street from his intended victim's house and the customers and barkeeps learn, via television, that a killer is at loose. From there on in, the maniac, who has cornered his hostages and called \\"1119\\"—the police—proceeds to hold his prey at bay as he awaits the doctor he wants in exchange for his frightened prisoners.Despite what could have been a single and static set, cameras, however, have managed to get movement and lucid commentary as they focus back and forth on the barroom and the street outside teeming with curious onlookers, the police keeping them in check, ice-cream vendors hawking their wares and the television truck on the scene to record the spot news development.Television, as has been noted, gets a wry appraisal from the bar owner—later slain by his demented guest—as he views a dull wrestling match and remarks, \\"cost $1,400 and it's more trouble than it's worth.\\" But, simultaneously, the producers give the medium an oblique kudo for its quick coverage of the news. But it is the cast and script which give the proceedings a special flavor.As the crazed gunman, Marshall Thompson is a seemingly cold and dispassionate youth, who only occasionally flashes evidences of his psychosis as he kills a bus driver, the bar owner, wounds two policemen and finally slays the psychiatrist who bravely tries to reason with the \\"demented man with a dream.\\"His hostages lend competent support, too. Include among these Virginia Field, as the beauteous bar-fly, who wounds her captor","excerpt":"Andrea King, as a girl debating whether to try an illicit week-end with Leon Ames, an oily salesman; William Conrad as the ill-fated barkeep; Keefe Brasselle, his waiter who is an expectant father, and James Bell, as a newspaper hack beside himself because he is \\"an eye-witness to a Pulitzer Prize story and I can't get to a phone.\\"Add too, the restrained portrayals of Sam Levene, as the psychiatrist, and Richard Rober, as the police captain in charge, as reasons why \\"Dial 1119\\" comes off with more suspense and conviction than is found in the average minor melodrama from the coast.

Culled by Stanley Neal Productions from an assortment of international film footage supposedly furnished by 108 cameramen, this feature-length compilation summarizes the general career, philosophies and practices of a godly politician. The United Artists release, fittingly presented by the American Academy of Asian Studies, with Quentin Reynolds serving as narrator, had its première last night at the Guild Theatre before a celebrity-packed audience.Purely as a film package, the offering provokes no new evaluation of the Hindu leader's historical niche. Indeed, except for the early, antiquated glimpses of his South African apprenticeship, interspersed with photographs, the bulk of the footage—an excellent introduction for the young, by the way—may seem familiar even to moderate moviegoers. And, while the editing, on the whole, is both conventional and sensible, some may feel that the repetitious crowd scenes could stand a generous pruning.However, the persistent sight of the tiny, bent figure pinpointed against the adulant masses that he loved and died for, the muted sincerity of Mr. Reynolds' commentary and the unadorned candor of the incidents recorded generate a personal and heart-warming intimacy that few such films can claim. And the magnet, in every scene, is the tiny symbol of love and selflessness, baring a toothless smile over his loom, always with his worldly goods—a pen, spectacles and a dollar watch—nearby.The scenes trace his rise in the Congress party, the insolvable clash with Jinnah's Moslem League, the festering conflict with the British (recounted with pointed impartiality) and the final emergence of the independent nation. Gandhi's brisk, 200-mile procession to the sea protesting the salt tax, and his incongruous appearance during a visit to London at the age of 62 comprise the most picturesque chapters.The film closes as the assassinated leader's body is cremated and the ashes are ceremoniously scattered at a point where the three sacred Indian rivers meet, while throngs line the banks. In \\"Mahatma Gandhi — Twentieth Century Prophet,\\" a cold, merciless camera eye has preserved unquestionable proof that here was a great and a good man.Among the notables attending the premiere of \\"Mahatma Gandhi — Twentieth Century Prophet\\" were the following:Sir Gladwyn Jebb, British Ambassador to the United Nations, and Lady Jebb","excerpt":"Andrei Y.

True enough, the composers on the program -- Ludwig Senfl, Hieronymus Praetorius, Hans Leo Hassler and Gregor Aichinger, as well as Heinrich Schütz and Bach -- were among Mozart's predecessors. But the connection is tenuous","excerpt":"Andrew Carwood's program notes don't so much as mention Mozart. And the Tallis Scholars, in any case, hardly need to jump on the Mozart bandwagon to fill Riverside Church, where the Miller Theater presents its most popular early music performances.      The music doesn't need to be heard in terms of its theoretical Mozart links, either, and in fact, trying to find more than fleeting connections would be futile. These composers wrote in the accents of other ages; the distance from Senfl's birth to Mozart's was 270 years, 20 years greater than the distance from Mozart's birth to now. In musical terms, for that matter, the distance from Senfl to Bach, the earliest and latest composers on the program, is pretty vast as well.

The question was raised Thursday night by a subtly colored, tensile performance of Sibelius's Fifth Symphony by Andrew Davis conducting the New York Philharmonic. Recordings of Sibelius symphonies generally picture mountains and waterfalls from the composer's native Finland on their covers, and Sibelius himself made no secret of his national interests. But performances like this one made it clear that the associations are not arbitrary.   Mr. Davis, in fact, treated the score, revised by the composer in 1921, with the sort of disciplined patience good musicians bring to long compositions, knowing from the start that there was much to come and that it would have to unfold at its own pace. In the first movement, nothing was rushed and each musical texture had its place: the winding thirds of the winds, the sustained calls of the horns, the syncopated patter of the strings. The main theme is deliberately off balance in every way, beginning on a weak beat and then emphasizing weak beats with disproportionate sustained tones. Mr. Davis turned the theme into a leitmotif, its strange, disruptive rhythms gradually becoming more tame as the movement proceeded.

Either unethical or illegal?

From his death in 1958 until the late 70's, Outerbridge was virtually a nonperson in terms of photographic history, having escaped mention in Beaumont Newhall's standard ''History of Photography'' and most other historical texts as well.  His output of delicate platinum prints and strident color-carbro prints long seemed hopelessly irrelevant, if not hokey, to modern eyes.   Today Outerbridge's fortunes have come full circle, and his claim to importance within 20th-century photo graphy is being staked on two fronts. For some - including John Pultz and C atherine B. Scallen, who organized the exhibition ''Cubism and Ame rican Photography, 1910-1930,'' now at George Eastman House in R ochester - Outerbridge stands as one of the major practitioners of t he Cubist-derived, abstractionist style that marked the medium's passage from pictorialism to modernism. For others - notab ly Graham Howe in the 1980 Rizzoli monograph ''Paul Outerbridge Jr. : Photographs'' - the photographer is equally if not more important for his pioneering color prints of the mid- to late-30's, prints which have gained attention for their fetishistic treatment of the female nude as well as for their high technical quality.

He has two children by two different women but still lives with his mother. When the mother's boyfriend (Ving Rhames) moves in, Jody is thrown into the real world and forced to make choices that will define his character for the rest of his life. When the film opened, A. O.
