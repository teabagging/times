The other is a Butoh dancer, Min Tanaka. He is seemingly clad in layers of clay, wearing a stiff earthen mask, miming the doomed ruler's every gesture or enacting his history in formalized gestures. He is a lifesize puppet, a mirror of Oedipus, the Theban king who is himself a sort of puppet, forced into a tragic snare set by the gods.    But as the horrifying truth of Oedipus's past comes to light, the clay shell around Mr. Tanaka is shed, leaving a vulnerable, nearly naked man: the only human figure free of elaborate costume and cosmetic trappings in the entire film. He who has been so blind to himself blinds himself. We see shredded strips of blood-red ribbon hanging on his face. Groping, with a blank stare, he stumbles under the scaffolding and ramps that compose the somber stage set, until he is walking knee-deep in a pool of dark water, surrounded by ghostly figures. The chanting of the chorus has come to an end. We watch the water dripping from above, then hear the sound of cleansing, pouring rain.

It will almost certainly be one of his most popular. Set in New York during the 1930's, it portrays the lives of Communist Party members and religious Jews. Until Mr. Potok's novel ''The Chosen,'' almost all popular American Jewish fiction - like most ethnic American fiction - focused on protagonists intent on escaping their childhood environments.

Yesterday America lost an extraordinary first lady and a fine Texan, Lady Bird Johnson. She brought grace to the White House and beauty to our country. On behalf of the American people, Laura and I send our condolences to her daughters, Lynda and Luci, and we offer our prayers to the Johnson family. Before I answer some of your questions, today I'd like to provide the American people with an update on the situation in Iraq. Since America began military operations in Iraq, the conflict there has gone through four major phases. The first phase was the liberation of Iraq from Saddam Hussein. The second phase was the return of sovereignty to the Iraqi people and the holding of free elections. The third phase was the tragic escalation of sectarian violence, sparked by the bombing of the golden mosque in Samarra. We've entered a fourth phase, deploying reinforcements and launching new operations to help Iraqis bring security to their people. I'm going to explain why the success of this new strategy is vital for protecting our people and bringing our troops home, which is a goal shared by all Americans. I'll brief you on the report we are sending to Congress. I'll discuss why a drawdown of forces that is not linked to the success of our operations would be a disaster. As president, my most solemn responsibility is to keep the American people safe. So on my orders, good men and women are now fighting the terrorists on the front lines in Iraq. I've given our troops in Iraq clear objectives. And as they risk their lives to achieve these objectives, they need to know they have the unwavering support from the commander in chief, and they do. And they need the enemy to know that America is not going to back down. So when I speak to the American people about Iraq, I often emphasize the importance of maintaining our resolve and meeting our objectives. As a result, sometimes the debate over Iraq is cast as a disagreement between those who want to keep our troops in Iraq and those who want to bring our troops home, and this is not the real debate. I don't know anyone who doesn't want to see the day when our brave service men and women can start coming home. In my address to the nation in January, I put it this way: If we increase our support at this crucial moment, we can hasten the day our troops begin coming home. The real debate over Iraq is between those who think the fight is lost or not worth the cost and those who believe the fight can be won, and that as difficult as the fight is, the cost of defeat would be far higher. I believe we can succeed in Iraq, and I know we must. So we're working to defeat al Qaeda and other extremists and aid the rise of an Iraqi government that can protect its people, deliver basic services (OTCBB:BICV) and be an ally in the war against these extremists and radicals. By doing this, we'll create the conditions that would allow our troops to begin coming home while securing our long-term national interests in Iraq and in the region. When we start drawing down our forces in Iraq, it will (be) because our military commanders say the conditions on the ground are right, not because pollsters say it'll be good politics. The strategy I announced in January is designed to seize the initiative and create those conditions. It's aimed at helping the Iraqis strengthen their government so that it can function even amid violence. It seeks to open space for Iraq's political leaders to advance the difficult process of national reconciliation, which is essential to lasting security and stability. It is focused on applying sustained military pressure to route-out terrorist networks in Baghdad and surrounding areas. It is committed to using diplomacy to strengthen regional and international support for Iraqi's democratic government. Doing all these things, it is intended to make possible a more limited role in Iraq for the United States. That's the goal outlined by the bipartisan Iraq Study Group. That's the goal shared by the Iraqis and our coalition partners. It is the goal that Ambassador Crocker and General Petraeus and our troops are working hard to make a reality. Our top priority is to help the Iraqis protect their population. So we've launched an offensive in and around Baghdad to go after extremists, to buy more time for Iraqi forces to develop and to help normal life and civil society take root in communities and neighborhoods throughout the country. We're helping enhance the size, capabilities and effectiveness of the Iraqi security forces, so the Iraqis can take over the defense of their own country. We're helping the Iraqis take back their neighborhoods from the extremists. In Anbar province, Sunni tribes that were once fighting alongside al Qaeda against our coalition are now fighting alongside our coalition against al Qaeda. We're working to replicate this success in Anbar and other parts of the country. Two months ago in the supplemental appropriations bill funding our troops, Congress established 18 benchmarks to gauge the progress of the Iraqi government. They require we submit a full report to Congress by September the 15th. Today my administration has submitted to Congress an interim report that requires us to assess, and I quote the bill, \\"whether satisfactory progress toward meeting these benchmarks is or is not being achieved.\\" Of the 18 benchmarks Congress asked us to measure, we can report that satisfactory progress is being made in eight areas. For example, Iraqis have provided the three brigades they promised for operations in and around Baghdad, and the Iraqi government is spending nearly $7.3 billion from its own funds this year to train, equip and modernize its forces. In eight other areas, the Iraqis have much more work to do. For example, they have not done enough to prepare for local elections or pass a law to share oil revenues. And in two remaining areas, progress is too mixed to be characterized one way or the other. Those who believe that the battle in Iraq is lost will likely point to the unsatisfactory performance on some of the political benchmarks. Those of us who believe the battle in Iraq can and must be won see the satisfactory performance on several of the security benchmarks as a cause for optimism. Our strategy is built on the premise that progress on security will pave the way for political progress, so it's not surprising that political progress is lagging behind the security gains we are seeing. Economic development funds are critical to helping Iraq make this political progress. Today I'm exercising the waiver authority granted me by Congress to release a substantial portion of those funds. The bottom line is that this is a preliminary report, and it comes less than a month after the final reinforcements arrived in Iraq. This September, as Congress has required, General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker will return to Washington to provide a more comprehensive assessment. By that time, we hope to see further improvement in the positive areas and the beginning of improvement in the negative areas. We'll also have a clearer picture of how the new strategy is unfolding, and be in a better position to judge where we need to make any adjustments. I will rely on General Petraeus to give me his recommendations for the appropriate troop levels in Iraq. I will discuss the recommendation with the secretary of defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. I will continue consultations with members of the United States Congress from both sides of the aisle. And then I'll make a decision. I know some in Washington would like us to start leaving Iraq now. To begin withdrawing before our commanders tell us we're ready would be dangerous for Iraq, for the region and for the United States. It would mean surrendering the future of Iraq to Al Qaida. It'd mean that we'd be risking mass killings on a horrific scale. It'd mean we'd allow the terrorists to establish a safe haven in Iraq to replace the one they lost in Afghanistan. It'd mean we'd be increasing the probability that American troops would have to return at some later date to confront an enemy that is even more dangerous. The fight in Iraq is part of a broader struggle that's unfolding across the region. The same region in Iran -- the same regime in Iran that is pursuing nuclear weapons and threatening to wipe Israel off the map is also providing sophisticated IEDs to extremists in Iraq who are using them to kill American soldiers. The same Hezbollah terrorists who are waging war against the forces of democracy in Lebanon are training extremists to do the same against coalition forces in Iraq. The same Syrian regime that provides support and sanctuary for Islamic Jihad and Hamas has refused to close its airport in Damascus to suicide bombers headed to Iraq. All these extremist groups would be emboldened by a precipitous American withdrawal, which would confuse and frighten friends and allies in the region. Nations throughout the Middle East have a stake in a stable Iraq. To protect our interests and show our commitment to our friends in the region, we are enhancing our military presence, improving our bilateral security ties and supporting those fighting the extremists across the Middle East. We're also using the tools of diplomacy to strengthen regional and international support for Iraq's democratic government. So I'm sending Secretary Gates and Secretary Rice to the region in early August. They will meet with our allies, reemphasize our commitment to the international compact of Sharm el-Sheikh, reassure our friends that the Middle East remains a vital strategic priority for the United States. There is a conversion (sic) of visions between what Iraqi leaders want, what our partners want and what our friends in the region want and the vision articulated by my administration, the Iraq Study Group and others here at home. The Iraqis do not want U.S. troops patrolling their cities forever, any more than the American people do. But we need to ensure that when U.S. forces do pull back, the terrorists and extremists cannot take control. The strategy that General Petraeus and the troops he commands are now carrying out is the best opportunity to bring us to this point. So I ask Congress to provide them with the time and resources they need. The men and women of the United States military have made enormous sacrifices in Iraq. They have achieved great things, and the best way to begin bringing them home is to make sure our new strategy succeeds. And, now, I'd be glad to answer a few questions. QUESTION: Mr. President, you started this war, the war of your choosing, and you can end it alone, today, at this point. Bring in peacekeepers, U.N. peacekeepers. Two million Iraqis have fled their country as refugees. Two million more are displaced. Thousands and thousands are dead. Don't you accept -- don't you understand, we brought the Al Qaida into Iraq? BUSH: Actually, I was hoping to solve the Iraqi issue diplomatically. That's why I went to the United Nations and worked with the United Nations Security Council, which unanimously passed a resolution that said, Disclose, disarm or face serious consequences. That was the message -- clear message to Saddam Hussein. He chose the course. QUESTION: But didn't we go into Iraq? BUSH: It was his decision to make. Obviously, it was a difficult decision for me to make to send our brave troops, along with coalition troops, into Iraq. I firmly believe the world is better off without Saddam Hussein is power. Now the fundamental question facing America is: Will we stand with this young democracy? Will we help them achieve stability? Will we help them become an ally in this war against extremists and radicals that is not only evident in Iraq, but it's evident in Lebanon, the Palestinian territories and Afghanistan? We're at the beginning stages of a great ideological conflict between those who yearn for peace and those who want their children to grow up in a normal, decent society -- and radicals and extremists who want to impose their dark vision on people throughout the world. Iraq is obviously -- Helen, has got the attention of the American people, as it should. This is a difficult war, and it's a tough war. But as I have consistently stated throughout the -- this presidency, it is a necessary war to secure our peace. I find it interesting that as this young democracy has taken hold, radicals and extremists kill innocent people to stop its advance. And that ought to be a clear signal to the American people that these are dangerous people. And their ambition is not just contained to Iraq","excerpt":"their ambition is to continue to hurt the American people. My attitude is we ought to defeat them there so we don't have to face them here, and that we ought to defeat their ideology with a more hopeful form of government. QUESTION: Mr. President, you're facing a rebellion from Republican -- key Republican senators who want you to change course and begin reducing the U.S. combat role. Given the mixed report that you present today, how do you persuade Republicans to stick with you as they look ahead to the next elections? BUSH: A couple of things. First of all, I respect those Republicans that you're referring to. I presume you're referring to friends of mine, like Lugar -- Senator Lugar, Domenici. These are good, honorable people. I've spoken to them. And I listened very carefully to what they have to say. First of all, they share my concern that a precipitous withdrawal would embolden Al Qaida. And they also understand that we can't let Al Qaida gain safe haven inside of Iraq. I appreciate, you know, their calls, and I appreciate their -- their desire to work with the White House to be in a position where we can sustain a presence in Iraq. What I tell them is this, just what I've told you, is that as the commander in chief of the greatest military ever I have an obligation, a sincere and serious obligation to hear out my commander on the ground. And I will take his recommendation -- and as I mentioned, to talk to Bob Gates about it, as well as the Joint Chiefs about it, as well as consult with members of the Congress, both Republicans and Democrats -- as I make a decision about the way forward in Iraq. And so, you know, I value the advice of those senators. I appreciate their concerns about the situation in Iraq. And I'm going to continue listening to them. QUESTION: Mr. President, in addition to members of your own party, the American public is clamoring for a change of course in Iraq. Why are you so resistant to that idea, and how much longer are you willing to give the surge to work before considering a change in this policy? BUSH: First of all, I understand why the American people are -- you know, they're tired of the war. People are -- there's war fatigue in America. It's affecting our psychology. I've said this before. I understand that. This is an ugly war. It's a war in which an enemy will kill innocent men, women and children in order to achieve a political objective. It doesn't surprise me that there is deep concern amongst our people. Part of that concern is whether or not we can win, whether or not the objective is achievable. People don't want our troops in harm's way if that which we're trying to achieve can't be accomplished. I feel the same way. I cannot look a mother and father of a troop in the eye and say, I'm sending your kid into combat, but I don't think we can achieve the objective. I wouldn't do that to a parent or a husband or a wife of a soldier. I believe we can succeed, and I believe we are making security progress that will enable the political track to succeed as well. And the report, by the way, which is -- as accurately noted as being submitted today -- is written a little less than a month after the full complement of troops arrived. I went to the country and said, I have made this decision. I said, What was happening on the ground is unsatisfactory in Iraq. In consultation with a lot of folks, I came to the conclusion that we needed to send more troops into Iraq, not less, in order to provide stability, in order to be able to enhance the security of the people there. And David asked for a certain number of troops. David Petraeus asked for a certain number. General Petraeus asked for a certain number of troops. And he just got them a couple of weeks ago. Military -- it takes a while to move our troops, as the experts know. You just can't load them all in one airplane or one big ship and get them into theater. They had to stage the arrival of our troops. And after they arrived in Iraq, it took a while to get them into their missions. Since the reinforcements arrived, things have changed. For example, I would remind you that Anbar province was considered lost. Maybe some of you reported that last fall. And yet today, because of what we call bottom-up reconciliation, Anbar province has changed dramatically. The same thing is now beginning to happen in Diyala province. There are neighborhoods in Baghdad where violence is down. There are still car bombs, most of which have the Al Qaida signature on them. But they're declining, you know. So there's some measurable progress. And you ask: How long does one wait? I will repeat as the commander in chief of a great military who has supported this military and will continue to support this military, not only with my -- with insisting that we get resources to them, but with -- but by respecting the command structure, I'm going to wait for David to come back -- David Petraeus to come back and give us the report on what he sees. And then we'll use that data, that -- his report, to work with the rest of the military chain of command and members of Congress to, you know, making another decision, if need be. QUESTION: You talk about all the troops now being in place, and only in place for the last three weeks or a month. Yet, three- quarters of the troops for the surge were in place during the period when this July interim report was written. Are you willing to keep the surge going, no matter what General Petraeus says, if there is no substantial Iraqi political progress by September? BUSH: You're asking me to speculate on what my frame of mind will be in September. And I would just ask that you give General Petraeus to come back and brief me. And then, of course, I'll be glad to answer your questions along that line. QUESTION: But there's been no -- but there has been no substantial political progress, even with three-quarters of the troops in there. BUSH: Well, as I mentioned... QUESTION: So can you keep that going through September even if there isn't... BUSH: As I mentioned in my opening remarks, we have felt all along that the security situation needed to change in order for there to be political progress. It's very hard for a young democracy to function with the violence that was raging. Secondly, there's a lot of the past that needs to be worked through the system. Living under the brutal tyrant Saddam Hussein created a lot of anxiety and a lot of tensions and a lot of rivalry. And it's just -- it's going to take a while to work it through. But they couldn't work through those tensions and rivalries in the midst of serious violence. And so the strategy was: Move in more troops to cause the violence to abate. And that's what David Petraeus will be reporting on. QUESTION: Question for you about the process you're describing of your decision-making as commander in chief. Have you entertained the idea that at some point Congress may take some of that sole decision-making power away through legislation? And can you tell us: Are you still committed to vetoing any troop withdrawal deadline? BUSH: You mean in this interim period? QUESTION: Yes. BUSH: I don't think Congress ought to be running the war. I think they ought to be funding our troops. I'm certainly interested in their opinion. But trying to run a war through resolution is a prescription for failure, as far as I'm concerned, and we can't afford to fail. I'll work with Congress. I'll listen to Congress. Congress has got all the right to appropriate money, but the idea of telling our military how to conduct operations, for example, or how to, you know, deal with troop strength is -- it's -- I -- I don't think it makes sense. I don't think it makes sense today, nor do I think it's a good precedent for the future. And so the role of the commander in chief is, of course, to consult with Congress. QUESTION: So if Reed-Levin or anything like it were to pass and set a -- BUSH: Well, I would hope they wouldn't pass, Jim. But I -- QUESTION: But -- BUSH: Let me make sure you understand what I'm saying. Congress has all the right in the world to fund. That's their main involvement in this war, which is to provide funds for our troops. What you're asking is whether or not Congress ought to be basically determining how troops are positioned, or troop strength. And I just -- I don't think that would be good for the country. David. QUESTION: Mr. President, you've said many times this war at this stage is about the Iraqi government creating a self-sustaining, stable government. Last November, your own CIA director, according to The Washington Post, told you about that government, quote, The inability of the government to govern seems irreversible. He could not point to any milestone or checkpoint where we can turn this thing around. And he said, in talking about the government, that, It's balanced, but it cannot function. BUSH: Yes. QUESTION: When you heard that, since that point, you think of how many hundreds of soldiers have been killed, how much money has been spent, why shouldn't people conclude that you are either stubborn, in denial, but certainly not realistic about the strategy that you've pursued since then? BUSH: You know, it's interesting, it turns out Mike Hayden -- I think you're quoting Mike Hayden there -- was in this morning to give me his weekly briefing. And I asked him about that newspaper article from which you quote. His answer was his comments to the Iraq Study Group were a little more nuanced than the quotation you read. He said that he made it clear the current strategy in Iraq wasn't working. That's his recollection of the briefing to the Iraq Study Group. He briefed them to the fact that it wasn't working and that we needed a change of direction. He also said that those who suggest that we back away and let the Iraqis' government do it -- this is in November of 2006 -- let the Iraqis handle it, don't understand the inability of the Iraq government at that time to take on that responsibility. He then went on to say -- this is what he -- his recollection of this conversation was that our strategy needed to help get the violence down, so that there could be political reconciliation from the top down as well as the bottom up. There has been political reconciliation from the bottom up. Anbar province is a place where the experts had -- or an expert had said that it was impossible for us to achieve our objective. This is the -- part of the country of Iraq where Al Qaida had made it clear that they would like to establish a safe haven from which to plan and plot further attacks, to spread their ideology throughout the Middle East. Since then, since this November 2006 report and since that statement to the Iraq Study Group, things have changed appreciably on the ground in Anbar province. And they're beginning to have the same change (ph), because the people on the ground there are sick and tired of violence and being threatened by people like Al Qaida, who have no positive vision for the future. And there's been a significant turn, where now Sunni sheiks and Sunni citizens are working with the coalition to bring justice to Al Qaida killers. And that same approach is being taken in Diyala. And so there's a lot of focus -- and should be, frankly -- on oil laws or elections. But, remember, there's another political reconciliation track taking place as well, and that's the one that's taking place at the grassroots level. Mike Hayden talked about that as well. QUESTION: So you think you've been realistic about the strategy and what's possible? BUSH: Well -- thank you for the follow-up. Nothing's changed in the new room. Anyway, yes. I mean, as I told you last November right about this time, I was part of that group of Americans who didn't approve of what was taking place in Iraq because it looked like all the efforts that we had taken to that point in time were about to fail. In other words, sectarian violence was really raging. And I had a choice to make, and that was to pull back, as some suggested, and hope that the chaos and violence that might occur in the capital would not spill out across the country, or send more troops in to prevent the chaos and violence from happening in the first place. And that's the decision I made, so it was a realistic appraisal by me. What's realistic as well is to understand the consequences of what will happen if we fail in Iraq. In other words, it's -- people aren't just going to be content with driving America out of Iraq; Al Qaida wants to hurt us here. That's their objective. That's what they'd like to do. They have got an ideology that they believe that the world ought to live under, and that one way to help spread that ideology is to harm the American people, harm American interests. The same folks that are bombing innocent people in Iraq were the ones who attacked us in America on September the 11, and that's why what happens in Iraq matters to security here at home. So I've been realistic about the consequences of failure. I have been realistic about what needs to happen on the ground in order for there to be success. And it's been hard work. And the American people see it as hard work. And one of the reasons it's hard work is because on our TV screens are these violent killings perpetuated by people who have done us harm in the past. And that ought to be a lesson for the American people to understand that what happens in Iraq and overseas matters to the security of the United States of America. QUESTION: On that point, what evidence can you present to the American people that the people who attacked the United States on September 11th are, in fact, the same people who are responsible for the bombings taking place in Iraq? What evidence can you present? And also, are you saying, sir, that Al Qaida in Iraq is the same organization being run by Osama bin Laden himself? BUSH: Al Qaida in Iraq has sworn allegiance to Osama bin Laden. And the guys who had perpetuated the attacks on America -- obviously, the guys on the airplane are dead. And the commanders, many of those are either dead or in captivity -- like Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. But the people in Iraq, Al Qaida in Iraq has sworn allegiance to Osama bin Laden. And we need to take Al Qaida in Iraq seriously, just like we need to take Al Qaida anywhere in the world seriously. QUESTION: Mr. President, in Jordan in November you stood by Prime Minister Maliki and said, He's the right guy for Iraq. Given this report card today and given the lack of top-down political reconciliation, can you tell the American people that you still believe he's the right guy for Iraq? BUSH: I believe that he understands that there needs to be serious reconciliation and they need to get law passed, I firmly believe that. I have had a series of conference calls with the prime minister, as well as the presidency council. In the presidency council, you would have the president, Talabani. You'd have the two vice presidents, Mahdi and Hashemi, as well as the prime minister. And I have urged them to work together to get law passed. It's not easy to get law passed in certain legislatures, like theirs. There's a lot of work that has to be done. And I will continue to urge... QUESTION: Do you have confidence in them? BUSH: Let me just -- I'm almost through with the first one, and I'll come back to the second one. And so I'll continue to urge the Iraqis to show us that they're capable of passing legislation. But it's not just us; it's the Iraqi people. And what really matters is whether or not life's improving for the Iraqi people on the ground. And, yes, I've got confidence in them. But I also understand how difficult it is. I'm not making any excuses, but it is hard. It's hard work for them to get law passed. And sometimes it's hard work for people to get law passed here. But that doesn't mean that we shouldn't continue to work to achieve an objective, which is a government that is able to, you know, provide security for its people and to provide basic services and, as importantly, serve as an ally against these extremists and radicals. QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. President. BUSH: No, not you. QUESTION: I'd like to switch subjects. BUSH: OK, is that harsh? QUESTION: Yes. BUSH: Like the new hall -- I should have been more gentle? Do we ever use kinder and gentler? No. Go ahead. QUESTION: If I could just switch subjects for a second to another big decision you made recently, which was in the Scooter Libby case, you spoke very soberly and seriously in your statement about how you weighed different legal questions in coming to your decision on that commutation. But one issue that you did not address was the issue of the morality of your most senior advisers, you know, leaking the name of a confidential intelligence operator. Now that the case is over -- it's not something you've ever spoken to -- can you say whether you're at all disappointed in the behavior of those senior advisers? And have you communicated that disappointment to them in any way? BUSH: First of all, the Scooter Libby decision was, I thought, a fair and balanced decision. Secondly, I haven't spent a lot of time talking about the testimony that people throughout my administration were forced to give as a result of the special prosecutor. I didn't ask them during that time and I haven't asked them since. I'm aware of the fact that perhaps somebody in the administration did disclose the name of that person. And, you know, I've often thought about what would have happened had that person come forth and said, I did it. Would we have had this, you know, endless hours of investigation and a lot of money being spent on this matter? But it has been a tough issue for a lot of people in the White House, and it's run its course, and now we're going to move on. Wendell. QUESTION: Mr. President, you have spoken passionately -- BUSH: Oh, I'm sorry, John. Okay. QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. President. QUESTION: You're taking it away from me? BUSH: I am. QUESTION: After doing the fair and balanced, you're going to take -- BUSH: Yeah. (Laughs, laughter.) PRESS MEMBERS: Ohhh. QUESTION: (Off mike.) QUESTION: You were going to come back to me, sir. BUSH: You got the mike, then John, you're next. Possession deal, you know what I'm saying? QUESTION: Thank you, sir. You have spoken passionately about the consequences of failure in Iraq. Your critics say you failed to send enough troops there at the start, failed to keep al Qaeda from stepping into the void created by the collapse of Saddam's army, failed to put enough pressure on Iraq's government to make the political reconciliation necessary to keep the sectarian violence the country is suffering from now from occurring. So why should the American people feel you have the vision for victory in Iraq, sir? BUSH: Those are all legitimate questions that I'm sure historians will analyze. I mean, one of the questions is, should we have sent more in the beginning? Well, I asked that question, Do you need more? to General Tommy Franks. In the first phase of this operation, General Franks, you know, was obviously in charge. And during our discussions in the run-up to the decision to remove Saddam Hussein after he ignored the Security Council resolutions, my primary question to General Franks was: Do you have what it takes to succeed? And do you have what it takes to succeed after you succeed in removing Saddam Hussein? And his answer was yes. Now, history is going to look back to determine whether or not there might have been a different decision made. But at the time, the only thing I can tell you is that I relied upon military commander to make the proper decision about troop strength in acting. And I can remember meeting with the Joint Chiefs, who said: We've reviewed the plan, and seemed satisfied with it. I remember sitting in the PIAT (ph), or the situation room, downstairs here at the White House. And I went to commander and commander, that were all responsible for different aspects of the operation to remove Saddam. I said to each of them, Do you have what it takes? Are you satisfied with the strategy? And the answer was yes. We have worked hard to help this country reconcile. After all, they do have a modern constitution, which is kind of a framework for reconciliation. And after all, there was a significant series of votes where the people were given a chance to express their desire to live in a free society. As a matter of fact, 12 million Iraqis went to the polls. What happened then, of course, is that the enemy -- Al Qaida -- attacks the Samarra mosque, which of course created anxiety and anger amongst the Shia and then all of a sudden the sectarian violence began to spiral. Reconciliation hadn't taken hold deep enough in society to prevent this violence from taking hold. And so I have a -- you know, I've got to decide whether or not it's OK for that violence to continue or whether or not it makes sense for us to try to send more troops in to quell the violence, to give the reconciliation process further time to advance. My concern is that, as a result of violence and killing, there would be chaos. Now that's -- that's a state of affairs that thugs like Al Qaida need to survive, and they like chaos. As a matter of fact, they like to create chaos in order to create conditions of fear and anxiety and doubt. Out of that chaos could come a further escalation of violence in the Middle East, and this is what's important for the American people to understand. That violence and that chaos would embolden extremists groups, whether they be Shia or Sunni. And they would then get into competition with each other. Such chaos and violence would send a mixed signal to the Iranians, who have stated that they believe Israel ought to be wiped off the map. People would begin to wonder about America's resolve. Al Qaida would certainly be in a better position to raise money and recruit. And what makes all this scenario doubly dangerous is that they have proven themselves able to attack us and kill nearly 3,000 of our citizens, and they would like to do it again. And therefore the strategy has got to be to help this government become an ally against these people. What happens in Iraq -- and I understand how difficult it's been. It's been hard. I have received a lot of inspiration, however, from meeting with our troops, who understand the stakes of this fight, and meeting with their families. And, you know, we owe it to our troops to support our commanders: smart, capable people who are devising a strategy that will enable us to succeed and prevent the conditions I just talked about from happening. QUESTION: Your administration has cited Al Qaida leaders such as Zawahiri as saying that if we leave prematurely, it would be a glorious victory for Al Qaida. But the reason that we can't leave or haven't been able to leave is not because we're getting defeated in any way militarily, it's because the Iraqis can't get it together so far. So why can't we counter those messages and, obviously, not withdraw precipitously, but begin some sort of gradual withdrawal that prevents ethnic cleansing but also allows our military to get out? BUSH: Well, there's a lot of discussion about a scenario in which our troop posture would be to guard the territorial integrity of the country of Iraq, to embed and train, to help the Iraqi security forces deal with violent elements in their society, as well as keep enough special forces there to chase down Al Qaida. As a matter of fact, that is something that I've spoken publicly about, said that's a position I'd like to see us in. However, I felt like we needed to send more troops to be able to get the situation to quiet down enough to be able to end in that position. And in terms of my own decision-making, as I mentioned earlier, I definitely need to be in consultation, and will be, with General David Petraeus, who asked for the additional troops in the first place, troops which have been in place -- fully in place for about three weeks. And so, I would ask members of Congress to give the general a chance to come back and to give us a full assessment of whether this is succeeding or not. And it's at that point in time that I will consult with members of Congress and make a decision about the way forward, all aiming to succeed and making sure that Al Qaida and other extremists do not benefit from a decision I might have to make. Mark? QUESTION: Yes, sir, Mr. President. BUSH: Yes, sir, Mark. (LAUGHTER) QUESTION: How come -- thank you. Thank you, sir. (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: How comfortable are you -- sir, how comfortable are you with your homeland security secretary saying, in the face of no credible intelligence of an imminent threat against the United States, that he has a gut feeling that one is coming this summer? And, sir, what does your gut tell you? BUSH: My gut tells me that -- which my head tells me as well -- is that when we find a credible threat, I'll share it with people to make sure that we protect the homeland. My head also tells me that Al Qaida's a serious threat to our homeland. And we've got to continue making sure we've got good intelligence, good response mechanisms in place; that we've got to make sure we don't embolden them with -- by failing in certain theaters of war where they're confronting us; that we ought to continue to keep the pressure on them. We need to chase them down and bring them to justice before they come home to hurt us again. And so it's a serious issue that is going to outlast my presidency. As I say, this is the beginning stages of what I believe is an ideological conflict that -- where you've got competing visions about what the world ought to be like. What makes this more difficult than previous conflicts is that there's the assymetrical use of power. In other words, IEDs and, you know, suicide bombers are the main -- the main tactical device used by these thugs to try to achieve, you know, strategic objectives. Their objective is to impose their vision of the -- on the world. Their objective is to drive the United States out of parts of the world. They want safe haven. They -- they -- they -- they'd love a society where women have no rights, just like the society that they worked to impose, with the Taliban, on the -- on the women of Afghanistan. That's their vision. And it's in our interests to defend ourselves by staying on the offense against them. And it's in our interests to spread an alternative ideology. We have done this before in our nation's history. We have helped people realize the blessings of liberty, even though they may have been our enemy. And freedom has an amazing way of helping lay the foundation for peace. And it's really important as we head into this ideological struggle in the 21st century that we not forget that liberty can transform societies. Now, the interesting debate is whether or not a nation, you know, like Iraq can self-govern, whether or not these people even care about liberty. As you've heard me say before, I believe -- strongly believe that freedom is a universal value, that freedom isn't just, you know, for Americans or Methodists, that freedom is universal in its application. And so when they voted in '05, I wasn't surprised -- I was pleased that the numbers were as big as they were to defy that many, you know, threats and car bombers, but I wasn't surprised. And this is the real challenge we face. And Iraq is just a part of a broader war against these jihadists and extremists. It's a -- it is a -- it is a -- we will be dealing with this issue for a while, just like we dealt with other ideologies for a while. It takes time for ideologies to take root. I firmly believe that you'll see the democracy movement continue to advance throughout the Middle East if the United States doesn't because isolationist. That's why I told you that I'm making sure that we continue to stay diplomatically involved in the -- in the -- in the region. Condi Rice and Bob Gates will be traveling there in early August to continue to remind our friends and allies that we're -- one, we view them as strategic partners and secondly that we want them to work toward, you know, a freer societies and to help this Iraqi government survive. It's in their interests that Iraq become a stable partner. And I believe we can achieve that objective. And not only do I believe we can -- I know we've got to achieve the objective so we will have done our duty. This is hard work. And one of the things I talked about in the opening comments was, you know, do we do it now or basically, you know, pull back, let the Gallup poll or whatever poll there are decide the fate of the -- of the country. And my view is that if that were to happen, we would then have to go back in with greater force in order to protect ourselves. Because one of the facts of the 21st century is that what happens overseas matters to the security of our country. QUESTION: Good morning, Mr. President. Given the events on the ground in Iraq and the politics here at home, has U.S. military deployment to Iraq reached the ceiling or can you allow any further military escalation? BUSH: You're trying to do what Martha very skillfully tried to get me to do, and that was to... QUESTION: Can I have a follow-up? BUSH: Yes, you can, because you're about to realize I'm not going to answer your question.... (LAUGHTER) ... except to say this: There's going to be great temptation to -- not temptation. There will be -- you won't be tempted. You'll actually ask me to speculate about what David Petraeus will talk to us about when he comes home. And I just ask the American people to understand that the commander in chief must rely upon the wisdom and judgment of the military thinkers and planners. It's very important that there be that solid connection of trust between me and those who are in the field taking incredible risk. And so I'm going to wait to see what David has to say. I'm not going to pre-judge what he may say. I trust David Petraeus' judgment. He's an honest man. Those of you who have interviewed him know that he's a straight shooter, he is an innovative thinker. I was briefed by members of the CODEL that came back that said that it appeared to them that our troops have high respect for our commanders in Baghdad, as do I. Now, do you have a follow-up on perhaps another subject, another area, another... QUESTION: How hard is it for you to conduct the war without popular support? Are you personally -- do you ever have trouble balancing the -- between doing what you think is the right thing and following the will of the majority of the public, which is really the essence of democracy? BUSH: Yes, it is. And, first of all, I can fully understand why people are tired of the war. The question they have is: Can we win it? And, of course, I'm concerned about whether or not the American people are in this fight. I believe, however, that, when they really think about the consequences, if we were to precipitously withdraw, they begin to say themselves, maybe we ought to win this; maybe we ought to have a stable Iraq. Their question, it seems like to me, is: Can we succeed? And that's a very important, legitimate question for anybody to ask. I think many people understand we must succeed. And I think a lot of people understand we've got to wait for the generals to make these military decisions. I suspect -- I know this: that, if our troops thought that I was taking a poll to decide how to conduct this war, they would be very concerned about the mission. In other words, if our troops said, Well, here we are in combat, and we've got a commander in chief who is, you know, running a focus group, in other words, Politics would be -- is more important to him than our safety and/or our strategy, that would dispirit our troops. And that's a lot of constituencies in this fight. Clearly, the American people, who are paying for this, is the major constituency. And I repeat to you, I understand that there -- this violence has affected them, and a lot of people don't think we can win. There's a lot of people in Congress who don't think we can win as well. And, therefore, their attitude is, Get out. My concern with that strategy, something that Mike Hayden also discussed, is that just getting out may sound simple, and it may affect polls, but it would have long-term, serious security consequences for the United States. And so sometimes you -- you know, you just have to make the decisions based upon what you think is right. My most important job is to help secure this country. And, therefore, the decisions in Iraq are all aimed in helping do that job and that's what I firmly believe. The second constituency is the military, and I repeat to you, I'm pretty confident our military do not want their commander in chief making political decisions about their future. A third constituency that matters to me a lot is military families. These are good folks who are making huge sacrifices, and they support their loved ones. And I don't think they want their commander in chief making decisions based upon popularity. Another constituency group that is important for me to talk to is the Iraqis. Obviously, I want the Iraqi government to understand that we expect there to be reconciliation, top-down, that we want to see laws passed. I think they've got that message. They know full well that the American government and the American people expect to see tangible evidence of working together. That's what the benchmarks are aimed to do. They also need to know that I'm making decisions based upon our security interests, of course, but also helping them to succeed and that a poll is not going to determine the course of action by the United States. What will determine the course of action is: Will the decisions that we have made help secure our country for the long run? And finally, another constituency is the enemy, who are wondering whether or not America has got the resolve and the determination to stay after them. And so that what's I think about. And, you know, I'm guess I'm like any other political figure. Everybody wants to be loved -- just sometimes the decisions you make and the consequences don't enable you to be loved. And so, when it's all said and done, if you ever come down and visit the old, tired me down there in Crawford, I will be able to say, I looked in the mirror and made decisions based upon principle, not based upon politics. And that's important to me. Thank you all for your time. I loved being here at this new building. Thank you. QUESTION: Can I just ask you about the Al Qaida intelligence report, please? BUSH: What was that? QUESTION: The intelligence... BUSH: This is amazing. QUESTION: I know. I know. BUSH: The new me. (LAUGHTER) The Al Qaida intelligence report? QUESTION: The intelligence analysts are saying Al Qaida has reconstituted in areas of Pakistan, saying the threat to the West is greater than ever now -- well, as great as 2001. What's happened? You tell... BUSH: OK, I'm glad you asked. Thank you. Thank you. I appreciate that opportunity to... QUESTION: Thank you for coming back. BUSH: I'm happy to do it. This is not the new me. I mean, this is just an aberration. In other words... QUESTION: It's over, next time? BUSH: I'm not going to leave and then come back for somebody to yell something at me. QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE) BUSH: Yes, exactly. Thank you. Thank you. I appreciate that. Exactly. There is a perception in the coverage that Al Qaida may be as strong today as they were prior to September the 11th. That's just simply not the case. I think the report will say since 2001, not prior to September the 11th, 2001. Secondly, that because of the actions we've taken, Al Qaida is weaker today than they would have been. They are still a threat. They are still dangerous. And that is why it is important that we succeed in Afghanistan and Iraq and anywhere else we find them. And that's our strategy, is: to stay on the offense against Al Qaida. She asked the question, Is it Al Qaida in Iraq? Yes, it is Al Qaida, just like it's Al Qaida in parts of Pakistan. And I'm working with President Musharraf to be able to -- I mean, he doesn't want them in his country. He doesn't want foreign fighters in the outposts of his country, and so we're working to make sure that we continue to keep the pressure on Al Qaida. But, no question, Al Qaida is dangerous for the American people, and that's why -- as well as other people that love freedom. And that's why we're working hard with allies and friends to enhance our intelligence. That's why we need terrorist surveillance programs. That's why it's important to keep -- and I would hope Congress would modernize that bill, and that's why we're keeping on the offense. Ultimately, the way to defeat these radicals and extremists is to offer alternative ways of life so that they're unable to recruit, that they can use -- they like to use frustration and hopelessness. The societies that don't provide hope will become the societies were Al Qaida has got the capacity to convince a youngster to go blow himself up. What we need to do is help governments provide brighter futures for their people so they won't sign up. And the fundamental question facing the world in this issue is whether or not it makes sense to try to promote an alternative ideology. I happen to think it does. They say, He's idealistic. Yeah, I'm idealistic. But I'm also realistic in understanding if there's not an alternative ideology presented, these thugs'll be able to continue to recruit. They'll use hopelessness to be able to recruit. And so it's a -- thank you for asking that question. QUESTION: Is bin Laden... BUSH: Thank you all. QUESTION: Is bin Laden alive?

Louis will be remembered for his generosity of spirit, wise counsel, and the enormous personal integrity that guided all aspects of his long and productive life. His enthusiasm for basic science encouraged Lucille P. Markey, one of the prominent clients of his law firm, Steel Hector & Davis, to become a benefactor of many research institutions, including this one. Following Mrs. Markey's death, he was instrumental in establishing the Lucille P. Markey Charitable Trust as an organization dedicated to the advancement of biomedical research. Under his chairmanship, the Markey Trust had a profound impact on the quality of scientific research in the United States, shining a bright light on the need for philanthropic investment in science and serving as a model for many foundations which followed. In 1994, The Rockefeller University recognized Louis Hector's enormous contributions to the advancement of science and medicine with an honorary doctoral degree. We will miss his keen intelligence, astute judgment, and inspiring optimism. His influence and legacy will be felt throughout the University for many years to come.

Differences appear to be emerging among the state attorneys general, as well as among state regulators and lawyers for smokers in private lawsuits, over issues like the ability of smokers to bring lawsuits under a settlement plan.   A1     Focus on Syphilis Study  A Presidential apology will be issued on Friday to the survivors among the group of 400 men in what has come to be known as the Tuskegee experiment. The men were subjected to an experiment designed to study the long-term effects of untreated syphilis on black men. But their wives and children, who may have been exposed to syphilis, have remained largely out of the spotlight.   A1     Arizona Governor Faces Trial  Gov. Fife Symington of Arizona is scheduled to go on trial in Phoenix on Tuesday on 22 charges of fraud, lying and extortion. The Governor, once a fast-rising star in the Republican Party and a land developer, is accused of misleading and pressuring lenders in a desperate effort to shore up a multimillion-dollar real estate empire that went bankrupt. If convicted, he could be sent to prison for scores of years.   B9     Fight Over Census Heats Up  Republican leaders in Congress appear to be heading for a showdown with the White House over their opposition to the use of statistical sampling to arrive at final population figures in the next census. Many political analysts say sampling would help Democrats and hurt Republicans because it would tally members of minority groups and poor people who might otherwise go uncounted, which could affect electoral districting.   B9     Marines in Crash Are Sought  The Navy and Coast Guard teamed up to search by sea and air after a helicopter with four marines aboard crashed into the Pacific Ocean. The helicopter, based in El Toro, Calif., crashed and sank after lifting off at sea from the Juneau, an amphibious transport ship.   (AP)    Sailor Is Found Dead  A man who was pitched overboard from a disabled sailboat during a rescue attempt has been found dead. The sailboat was bumped by a ship attempting to rescue the man and his two comrades. The captain of the sailboat, the Ankh, was hurt during a voyage from Bermuda to the ship's port in Rhode Island. The ship sent out an emergency call about 450 miles east of Cape Henry, Va.   (AP)    Arizona District to Vote  Voters in the 3d Congressional District in northern New Mexico will decide on Tuesday who will succeed Bill Richardson, the Democratic Representative who resigned in February to become ambassador to the United Nations.   B8    NEW YORK/REGION   B1-7    A New Chess Champion Who Can't Take a Bow  The I.B.M. computer Deep Blue unseated Garry Kasparov, the world chess champion, as the finest chess-playing entity on the planet. Mr. Kasparov resigned the sixth and final game of the match after just 19 moves. Grandmasters and computer experts alike went from praising the match as a great experiment to smacking their foreheads in amazement at the champion's abrupt crumpling.   A1    Stodgy old I.B.M. has now come up with its own media star, even geekier and more glamorous than Microsoft's Bill Gates: Deep Blue, its 1.4-ton chess computer. I.B.M. executives said it was hard to determine how Deep Blue's celebrity would  translate into increased sales, though the company's marketers are no doubt conjuring up new advertising campaigns featuring the electronic grand master.   B4     Pataki Offers Rent Plan  Gov. George E. Pataki proposed immediately lifting rent protections for a small number of wealthy tenants, which appeared to lay the groundwork for a broader plan to remove controls from apartments as they become vacant. The proposals stake out a middle ground between Republicans in the State Senate who want to abolish the current rent regulations and Democrats in the Assembly who want to preserve them. The regulations will expire after June 15 if state lawmakers do not reach an agreement to extend them.   A1     John Cardinal O'Connor urged state lawmakers yesterday to preserve the current rent regulation laws until a panel could examine changes that would not hurt the poor and middle classes. In a sermon at St. Patrick's Cathedral, he said ''dignified affordable housing'' was a human right. He did not offer solutions of his own but said a broadly representative commission should be convened to make recommendations to the State Legislature.   B6     Harbor Dredging to Begin  A floating dredge is scheduled to begin scooping thousands of tons of accumulated mud from one of the main channels plied by the container ships that move into and out of New York Harbor. New York and New Jersey have come up with a few innovative ways to dispose of dredged mud, but they still have not devised a long-term plan to accommodate all the mud, which contains pollutants.   B1     2 Men Charged in Ambush  Two men were charged with attempted murder and three counts of robbery in the ambush and shooting of a retired police officer and an off-duty detective during a payroll robbery in Queens on Friday. The authorities have identified the men as Aaron Boone, 26, of 53-18 Junction Boulevard in Corona, and Robert Majors, 31, of 134-16 229th Street in Laurelton, Queens. Both men have long criminal records and have served prison sentences, the authorities said.   B3      BUSINESS DAY   D1-13     Mini-Van's Appeal Fading  Mini-van sales are falling after more than a decade of steadily rising sales. No one disputes that the mini-vans are roomy, practical and cheaper than most sport utility vehicles and some of the sedans people are buying instead. But more and more people are rejecting the mommy-mobile image that mini-vans project.   A1     Phone Companies' Jitters  Large local phone companies around the United States that serve both rural areas and urban areas are bracing for a massive redistribution of revenue caused by telephone deregulation. Some say the changes could jeopardize the nation's tradition of universal phone service.

Because primate animals have to be blood type-matched with human recipients and our World Health Organization Collaborating Center is the only laboratory performing such tests, I have been involved in practi cally all such xenotransplants (transplants between different species) since early 1960. I would like to share my experience in 1963 of the immense gratitude and relief of the first successfully xenotransplanted patient: \\"Doctor, but for that monkey, I would be a dead man. I am thankful for every day I live.\\"    About 30 patients received primate kidneys in the 1960's before the availability of dialysis","excerpt":"their clinical course was not much different from that of patients transplanted with kidneys from unrelated human donors.   With the advent of cyclosporin and, most recently, of an experimental antirejection medication, new possibilities are opened to save patients, many of them young and vigorous, who are dying because of the failure of only one organ in otherwise healthy bodies. I believe that Ms. Roy's perspective would be changed by a visit to a transplantation ward where she could see and talk to patients slowly dying while awaiting the so scarce human donor organs.   Moreover, the laws do not allow the removal of an organ from an animal to \\"entail enormous suffering.\\" Such procedures are strictly monitored by the institutions and by state and Federal authorities: an organ is removed under deep anesthesia, followed by euthanasia.   There are thousands of patients whose hearts were repaired using pig heart valves. It must also be taken into consideration that baboons are considered pests, and there is a bounty on them in several African countries. Surgeons would prefer not to kill a baboon or any other animal, but they hope that xenotransplantation will save dying patients; such a hope is strengthened by the Pittsburgh case.

(Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $24.) Abani's protagonist, Elvis Oke, lives in a slum near Lagos, Nigeria, where the poor pick on the extremely poor, violence is ubiquitous and justice rare. The author was arrested in 1985, when he was 18, in connection with a politically dangerous novel he had written two years earlier.    THE BRONTË MYTH, by Lucasta Miller. (Knopf, $26.95.) In a book about biography as much as about the Brontës, Miller surveys the mythification of the three brilliant bad-luck sisters on the blasted heath of Yorkshire as a growth industry, a process of romantic adoption and transformation that started while Charlotte, the last to die, was still on the scene.    A QUESTION OF BLOOD, by Ian Rankin. (Little, Brown, $22.95.) Rankin's 14th novel about Inspector John Rebus adheres fairly closely to the procedural formula, though its author sometimes cites the perceptions of the Rolling Stones. This time around, Rebus himself is in trouble for being seen drinking with a man who turns up the following day as a murder victim.    TRIOMF, by Marlene van Niekerk. (Overlook, $25.95.)

STRANGERS: Homosexual Love in the Nineteenth Century, by Graham Robb. (Norton, $26.95.) A brilliant work of social archaeology by a writer who comes to gay history by way of writing the lives of Rimbaud and Balzac; he has discovered that there were plenty of gay people way back when, that everybody knew this and that attitudes were not radically different from what they are now, though the criminal penalties could be a lot more severe.    DOT IN THE UNIVERSE, by Lucy Ellmann. (Bloomsbury, paper, $13.95.) A cheerfully subversive novel whose heroine, Dot, an inconspicuous wifey in an English seaside town, acquires a taste for blood in an accident and takes to wiping folk out, including herself; after a spell in hell, she is reborn to an American family, but retains, for social observation and comment, all her British powers of snideness.    DANCING WITH CUBA: A Memoir of the Revolution, by Alma Guillermoprieto. (Pantheon, $25.) In 1969 the author, then a 20-year-old Merce Cunningham dance student, took a teaching job in Castro's Cuba. She and Cuba did not get on; though she did her best, she found homosexual artists more appealing than Fidelista officials.

It is not, however, as you state, \\"because of the reluctance to raise the taxes\\" that the Federal unemployment insurance program, \\"meant to ease the pain of recession,\\" is much less effective than it used to be. It was the elimination of the uniform Federal tax and the substitution of the right of states to set the level of the tax they imposed on businesses that started this debacle.   The states largely substituted a regressive tax on business, easing the burden on larger employers, transferring costs to smaller companies. In addition to the regressive taxes, the ceilings on taxable wages bear little relation to the benefits paid to a company's laid-off workers.   In Pennsylvania the maximum annual taxable wage is $8,000. Consider two industries suffering layoffs, garment and steel. The garment workers making $160 a week could have drawn $82 a week in unemployment insurance in 1990. The steelworkers earning $550 a week would be entitled to $181. The employers of both would contribute to the fund on the first $8,000 of wages, and their experience-rated tax percents could be the same, even though their employees received vastly different benefits.   This regressiveness and disproportion came about because the unemployment system was delegated to the states. The low level of benefits, about 35 percent of what workers were earning at their last jobs, and the limited duration of benefits also result from relegation to the states.    In other countries, a uniform national unemployment insurance system recognizes that the national economy has an impact on employment levels, with states having little influence. Benefits in most developed economies (except South Africa) are set at 60 percent or more of previous earnings, and durations of benefits are longer. Also, in other countries there is an employment system focusing on training, education, counseling and relocation, with unemployment assistance truly an adjunct to re-employment.   This interstate competition system has encouraged a bidding war. \\"Businesses argue,\\" you state, \\"and many politicians agree, that a lower unemployment insurance tax improves the business climate of a state and makes it more attractive to companies that might wish to come there.\\" When smaller businesses argue thus, they are being seduced by a class argument","excerpt":"their economic self-interest would be better served by a more equitable system -- shifting the tax burden to larger and less competitive enterprises better able to pay.    When politicians agree, they are misdiagnosing the problem and prescribing the wrong cure; if they seek job creation, they should ease the burden on smaller enterprises, which create jobs while larger ones are shedding employees.   One of the many reasons unemployment insurance is aiding fewer workers is that more workers are discouraged -- by employers, because most states have tightened eligibility requirements and because many unemployment compensation bureaucracies are employer-sympathetic and user-unfriendly. In most states it is not illegal for an employer announcing a layoff to threaten those who apply for benefits during temporary layoffs with not being recalled. Because of funds cuts many offices are understaffed, lines are long and counseling (benefit rights and vocation guidance) is nonexistent.    The Keynesian counter-cycle concept underlying the 1935 legislation -- collect taxes when times are good, pay benefits to sustain purchasing power during downturns -- is undermined by the present system. As soon as the funds build up a substantial balance, business presses for givebacks. Reserves built during periods of full employment, such as World War II, were given back to employers through refunds and credits. That benefit funds are in shaky financial condition is not an accident; it is inherent in a system that fails to treat the money as a true trust fund.    In 1985, the Pennsylvania fund faced a fiscal crisis. As part of a tripartite deal, business and labor agreed with government that they would come up with a solution: 60 percent of the deficit reduction would come from business and 40 percent from labor. When the A.F.L.-C.I.O. proposed, instead of the conventional business-political solution of cutting benefits and eligibility, to generate its share through a one-tenth of 1 percent of payroll tax, the business community balked. They did not want any worker contribution (routine in other countries) that would encourage the idea that unemployment benefits were a normative right. They pay for the system and thereby exercise decisive influence over it.   Representative Thomas J. Downey is right to say, \\"It's a classic economic march of folly.\\" It may be too late to correct the situation for this recession; it's not too late to revise this nonfunctional unemployment compensation system for layoff victims and a society ill served by the present system.

Beloved daughter of the late Charles Cohn and Bella Cohen Cohn, adored sister of Seymour Cohn and the late Mildred Cohn, Maurice Cohn, Irene Colvin and Sylvan Lawrence, devoted and loyal wife of the late Henry Miller, and cherished aunt and great-aunt to each and every member of the Cohen and Cembalest families. Born on October 20, 1906 in New York City, the youngest daughter in a large and accomplished family, Pearl devoted herself to her studies, eventually becoming a teacher in the New York City Public School System. As a young girl, Pearl began her life-long involvement with Tranquillity Camp. As the ideal embodiment of the Cohen family credo ''Noblesse Oblige,'' Pearl soon became the indispensable right-hand of her uncle, the late Elias A. Cohen, one of the truly great men of his time, who founded Tranquillity Camp in 1919. After his sudden passing in July of 1952, Pearl shouldered the tremendous responsiblity of keeping the Camp going. For well over 50 years, Pearl selflessly and tirelessly devoted every minute of every day to her family, and to each of the children whose character was so quietly and subtlely molded by her example. Despite her towering intellect and photographic memory, Pearl, like so many members of the Cohen family before her, never talked down to anyone. To us she was a unique individual, a giant. When flattered by anyone, she would characteristically brush it off with a small wave of her hand, saying ''It's nothing. I just do what I do.'' She made it all seem so simple. Services will be held on Sunday, August 31, 2003, 11AM at Schwartz Brothers - Jeffer Memorial Chapel, 114-03 Queens Blvd., Forest Hills, NY. In lieu of flowers, contributions to Tranquillity Camp, Inc., 170 Tranquillity Rd., Earlton, NY 12058, would be appreciated.    MILLER--Pearl C. The Officers, Board of Directors, Staff and all the children of Tranquillity Camp are deeply saddened by the passing of our beloved President, Pearl C. Miller. From her first days there as a child some ninety years ago through all the ensuing decades as the leader, conscience, soul and spirit of Tranquillity, to all who knew her, from the youngest camper to the oldest Alumni, she was simply ''Pearl.'' However, there was nothing simple about this truly remarkable individual. For many years, Pearl taught in the NYC Public School system and assisted her uncle, the late Elias A. Cohen, who founded Tranquillity Camp in 1919. After his sudden passing in July, 1952, with nothing much more than the credo ''Noblesse Oblige'' as their guide, an unwavering and totally dedicated Pearl, together with her late husband, her beloved Henry, at her side, her family and other devoted Tranquillity - ites, worked unceasingly to keep the little camp going. They overcame countless obstacles","excerpt":"their efforts paid off as the little camp survived and grew. But the original ideals on which Tranquillity was based have never changed. As the years turned into decades and the decades into generations, the number of people whose characters and lives were indelibly enriched by the timeless lessons passed on by Pearl at Tranquillity became legion. Following Pearl's example, many returned and gave of themselves to help Camp. Although tens of thousands of children were campers over the years, Pearl got to know each one as an individual. To the amazement of so many campers who asked Pearl if she remembered them, her reply invariably included a family history and a story or two about a parent, grandparent, great-grandparent or other relative who came to Camp. Like many of the great people who will be remembered over the ages, Pearl's vision was on a scale almost too vast to comprehend; but she never lost sight of where she was. No detail was ever too small to be overlooked--and she saw to all of them. Everyone who knew Pearl will carry in their heart, to be treasured for all time, the memory of a shared special moment. None of us will ever forget the Barn story, walks through the White House garden, hearing the story of Gilda Van Gelder or Pearl's Friday night message after services. As a rule, she preferred praise to criticism. To inspire a single camper, she would instead talk to a group of children, sometimes with the admonishment, ''Don't be a Schlemiel.'' Pearl was often referred to as ''the First Lady of Tranquillity.'' To honor this great woman, we need only follow her instruction to ''carry on.'' Pearl, we pledge to do just that, year after year after year. While you will always be missed, you will never leave us, for you will remain in our minds and in our hearts forever. Services will be held on Sunday, August 31, 2003, 11 AM, at Schwartz Bros.-Jeffer Memorial Chapel, 114-03 Queens Blvd, Forest Hills, NY. In lieu of flowers, contributions to Tranquillity Camp, Inc, 170 Tranquillity Rd, Earlton, NY 12058, would be appreciated.    MILLER--Pearl C. Throughout one's journey through life, you come upon certain people that you can never forget. Pearl C. Miller has been a guiding light, mentor, surrogate parent when needed and a friend. With her wisdom, guidance, kindness and generosity, she played a major role in our lives. We will never forget and always remember the countless times we called upon her to help us through the many challenges we faced. While growing up on Tranquillity Farm, Pearl made us members of the Tranquillity family. Pearl C. Miller will always remain in our hearts and in our minds. We will never forget and pledge to carry on in a way that would make her proud of who we have become. With Love Always, Allyson Pettit Benjamin and Justin Pettit    MILLER--Pearl C. The Tranquillity Alumni mourns the passing, and celebrates the life of our Pearl, a rock and a profound influence on children and adults for nearly a century. Pearl taught generations of children the lessons of Tranquillity Camp as originally articulated by her beloved Uncle and our founder, Elias A. Cohen. We were taught to be good people, good Americans and to share our good fortunes in the spirit of Noblesse Oblige. Together with husband Henry, she devoted her life to nourishing the lives of tens of thousands of people. In tribute to her life we pledge to keep her dream alive. Our sympathies to the Cohen family, and to Pearl's extended family throughout the world. The Tranquillity Alumni    MILLER--Pearl C. The officers and directors of the Elias A. Cohen Foundation, Inc, mourn the passing of President Emeritus Pearl C. Miller, who served so ably as President for over twenty years. In demeanor and action, Pearl exemplified the character, spirit and determination that were the hallmark of her late uncle, Elias A. Cohen. She has fovever set the standard that the rest of us and our descendants will need to strive for. Like a beacon, Pearl brought us all together, and with her gentleness and consideration always evident, proved that unity was the better path.

To all of the cousins of my generation, you were ''Aunt Petey.'' We knew there was no choice, so we shared you with all the children of Tranquillity. Through all the years, you had enough love for all of us. There must be a bright, new star in the heavens. There is no need to look. You stayed on to help us, never thinking of yourself; we will never forget. You are now with your beloved Henry. I will feel you in my heart--always. Your Loving Nephew, Richard Lawrence    MILLER--Pearl C. To my older sister Pearl, my ''Petey.'' Throughout all the years, we have been like two peas in a pod, different yet the same.

Done in China marker, colored pencil and chalk on large sheets of paper, they are composed of curving shapes that seem like a cross between technological and intestinal forms. In one, a pinkish-red tube twists into a circle, its two ends joined by a mysterious ice-blue cylinder that seems to be generating vapor. In another, a ribbon-shaped tube, highlighted with touches of yellow, orange, red and blue, disgorges smaller versions of itself from a funnel-shaped opening.   What is most striking about the forms is the torment to which Mr. Newman subjects them. They are kinked and squeezed where they bend","excerpt":"their ends are tied and stretched, and in general they enact a kind of monumental, rubbery version of sadomasochistic posturing. This vision is mollified somewhat by the delicacy of Mr. Newman's draftsmanship; his line is unusually elegant and firm, and he works his highlighting to a handsome burnish.   One suspects that the faint grids against which he sets his literally painstaking forms are intended to cushion their psychological eccentricities. If so, the device works only in part. In his sculptures seen elsewhere, which correspond closely to these drawings, Mr. Newman strikes a successful balance between the mechanical and the anatomical, and the results are both buoyant and crisp. In the drawings, however, despite their high technical accomplishment, an unappealing cartoonlike freakishness prevails.

When their parents are burned as witches by the good citizens of Lausanne, Bea and Colin reject the barony and flee first to China, then to Ayuthia, city of the Thais. There they make androids, explore ''the Gift'' - a legacy from their mother - and struggle with their feelings for each other. Those readers who have followed Han Suyin's political writings, her huge memoir or her romantic novel, ''Love Is a Many Splendored Thing,'' may at first be perplexed by this book. Where are the autobiographical tidbits, the fervent, prolix descriptions of China's role in the coming world order? Eventually, however, all becomes clear. It is a parable - the author's underlying concern is the fusion of the West's scientific rationalism and the East's natural mysticism into a single utopian vision. When Bea and Colin reach Ayuthia they are whirled into a gigantic plan to revolutionize the world by using their gift. In this paradisaical city all seems possible, for a time; but ultimately Ayuthia falls, and with it, the purity of their dream.

One of the researchers, Thure E. Cerling, a University of Utah geologist, said the findings suggested that the nation's highly radioactive nuclear wastes could be deposited at Yucca Mountain, in southern Nevada, without fear of polluting underground waters.    Yucca Mountain has been chosen by the Federal Government as the primary prospective site for a nuclear waste dump, in part, because preliminary studies showed that it appeared to be unlikely that ground water would flood a waste repository installed 450 feet underground. Mineral Deposits Found    But in one of a number of test trenches dug across faults near Yucca Mountain, experts found a network of carbonate veins. The mineral deposit often is associated with water.    Some experts have said the minerals were deposited in the last Ice Age, which ended about 12,000 years ago, when ground water rose to a level that would fill the proposed underground nuclear dump.    But Dr. Cerling and the other researcher, Jay Quade, also of Utah, say the deposits are much, much older.    \\"These findings provide no evidence of rising ground water at the site,\\" Dr. Cerling said. \\"I can't say positively that this would never happen, but this study certainly provides no evidence for such a scenario.\\"  More Work Is Needed    As a result, he said, Yucca Mountain \\"looks a lot better than a lot of other places\\" as a safe, stable place to store radioactive nuclear wastes. But he cautioned that \\"there is still a lot of work to be done\\" before the geology in the area is fully understood.    Experts who disagree with the study's conclusions said that its type of analysis was not new, having been previously raised by some Federal scientists, and that it was based on data from Yucca Mountain that ignore much evidence to the contrary.    Two high-level Federal panels are studying the ground water issue","excerpt":"their findings are expected to settle the issue. The first report is due early next year.    In the current issue of the journal Science, the journal of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the researchers said the carbonates found in the trench, Number 14, were deposited thousands of years before the last Ice Age and that ground water had not risen to the level of the proposed nuclear repository for more than 300,000 years.    The carbonates, Dr. Cerling said, \\"were formed in the soil or by soil-forming processes. The important point is that they would have formed in the unsaturated zone, which means there is not permanent water there.\\"    Dr. Cerling said that means the deposit of nuclear wastes at the Yucca Mountain site was less likely to pollute underground water.

On the other side sat his wife, a partner with him in the firm of Venturi, Rauch & Scott Brown. A firebrand in her own right, she wrote, with her husband and Steven Izenour, ''Learning From Las Vegas'' in 1972, which opened the collective architectural eye to the notion that the sprawl of honky-tonk landscapes represents a new and vital urban form.   It might have made more sense to discuss with them their ongoing desire for nonmonumental architecture rich with historical and psychological symbolism.

Though \\"Fallen From Heaven\\" ultimately takes the shape of a dark comic parable about life, fate and death, the route to those giant themes is wry, twisty and lighter than a pig's wings.   The episodic narrative weaves deftly among three connected sets of characters ranging across Lima's social classes: Lizardo and his wife, Jesus, an old couple bent on completing a marble mausoleum even if it means selling the family heirlooms","excerpt":"their former housekeeper, a blind old woman who lives in a shack with her two small grandsons, and a radio talk-show host whose on-air name is Don Ventura.

He was County Clerk and Clerk of the Supreme Court and Commissioner of Jurors, Kings County, and former President, CEO and Chairman of Independence Savings Bank, and President of Martin's Department Store. Bill was a long-time board member of many institutions, including Brooklyn Law School, Helen Keller Services for the Blind, Brooklyn Botanic Garden, Brooklyn Hospital Center, Prospect Park Alliance and the New York Organ Donor Network. He was a graduate of the Boston Latin School and Yale College ('41), and a First Lieutenant in the Army (1942-1946). In addition to his dedicated public service, Bill will long be remembered for the sense of humor and sound advice that guided his family and many friends through life, as well as for the candy and silver dollars he found in their ears. He is survived by his wife Phyllis","excerpt":"their four children: John Levin (and Louisa Swift), Peter (and Anna) Levin, Emme (and Jonathan) Deland, and Kate Levin (and Mark di Suvero); seven grandchildren: Dylan, Mariah, Rawle, Will, Ned, Kate and Veri; and his sister Jean Brenner.

All of us at Independence Community Bank mourn the death of Wilbur A. Levin, 84, a friend, business leader, and generous public citizen. We extend our deepest sympathy to his wife, Phyllis, his children, grandchildren and the entire family for their loss. ''Bill'' Levin joined the Bank's Board of Trustees in 1965, was elected Executive Vice President in 1972 and became our 10th President in 1973, a post he held until 1985 when he became Chairman of the Board, retiring in 1995. During his tenure Mr. Levin had a pivotal role in creating a strong bank despite the deregulation of interest rates that led to economic upheaval in the banking industry. He also played an industry leadership role with the Community Bankers Association of NY State, frequently representing the Bank and the industry in Washington and Albany on regulatory issues and other challenges. Bill Levin set a high personal standard for community service and made it part of the Bank's business philosophy. In addition to many other civic activities that have enriched the life of the city and its people, Bill Levin was instrumental in the renaissance of the Downtown Brooklyn commercial district and the revival of the Brooklyn Botanic Garden and Prospect Park. He continues to be the inspiration for the active involvement of Independence and its executives in the civic and economic life of the communities where we live and work. Bill Levin also brought a high moral tone to everything he did which stands as an example to everyone in business. As a friend, a business leader and an extraordinary public citizen, all of us will miss him. Charles J. Hamm, Chairman Alan H. Fishman, President & CEO and The Board of Directors of Independence Community Bank   LEVIN--Wilbur A. The Brooklyn Hospital Center is profoundly saddened by the passing of its esteemed Trustee, Wilbur A. Levin. Bill Levin has been a Trustee of The Brooklyn Hospital Center since June of 1964. Over his tenure of forty-one years, he served as Chairman of The Governance Committee (formerly Nominating Committee), the Development and Community Relations Committee, and the Joint Conference Committee. He was currently a member of the Executive Committee, and had previously served on the Operations Committee, and Financial Development Committee. In 1986, he was the first Trustee to receive the Hospital's Founder's Medal at the First Founders Ball event, and in 1999, he was recognized as the Hospital's Distinguished Trustee at the United Hospital Fund Annual Distinguished Trustee Luncheon. His integrity, thoughtfulness, and sense of humor will be greatly missed. The Board of Trustees, and the entire Brooklyn Hospital family extend deepest sympathy to the Levin family.

Even if one sets out specifically to find it, the English countryside is often lost to the traveler through the permanently dirty double-glazed windows of British Rail or, worse, through a haze of fear at driving on the wrong side of the road. Unless one has discovered the estimable National Trust, which has chosen and converted over 150 of its properties - farmhouses, mill cottages, castle watchtowers, even country-house lodges -making them available for rental all year round. In one of these holiday cottages, furnished with traditional (if uninspired) English furniture and appliances, in the midst of moorland, coastline, farmyard or garden, it is difficult not to come away with some truer sense of rural England.   The National Trust is a charity that was founded in 1895 to protect the nation's remaining places of historic interest and natural beauty. As well as protecting thousands of acres of countryside and coastland, it cares for every kind of historic building bequeathed to it, from medieval abbeys to isolated dovecotes, and among these are several that have been fully equipped to accommodate holidaymakers in the mood for a vacation in a remote setting.

With the mountains themselves, bleak and immemorial, for backgrounds, and enough costume extras to excite the professional envy of DeMille, the picture also is blest with superimposed titles of almost poetical compactness and imagery. The principal actors, in long belted coats with curved daggers and astrakhan caps, seem as authentic as the rocky ethnological wastes in which they move among shaggy flocks and herds.Even their tribe names have a barbaric beauty: Circassians, Abkhasians, Kabardins, Ossetians, Ingushes","excerpt":"their languages take the ear back a hundred centuries to pastoral, nomadic lands and prehistoric migrations; in their faces and eyes are the secrets of the cradle of civilizations. It is really very doubtful whether the Bolshvik organizers (here represented by Boris Babochkin of \\"Chapayev\\" fame) have resolved all their tribal differences and boundary disputes and have brought them tamely to heel in one vast ideological family, as the picture makes out. But even friendship for propaganda's sake these days is better than no friendship at all.So, when Beta, the tall, glum Ossetian, and Mussa, the fat, irascible Ingush, traditional enemies, turn from highway banditry to the service of the cause, clasp hands and march back together to save their villages from the darkness of the ancient ways, the moment is a thrilling one. Especially noteworthy is the acting of K. Daushvili as Umar the Kabardin. From the instant when Umar's interesting Eurasian face is cut by the Cossack's whip until the final, amusingly melodramatic annihilation of the White army in the pass, \\"Friends\\" affords priceless glimpses into the windows of another world.

In ''The Cameraman'' (1928), which was lost for decades in the middle of the last century, this incomparable comedian is in love with a pretty girl who works on MGM newsreels, and sets out to impress her with his camera work. (There's live piano accompaniment for two of the screenings.) In ''Spite Marriage'' from 1929, Keaton's last silent picture (with sound but no dialogue), he plays a star-struck dry cleaner who falls in love with, then unexpectedly marries, a Broadway diva.

The picture focuses on an elegant family ravaged with debts","excerpt":"their mansion is falling to pieces—and so (on a grand scale) are they.The movie, which is intensely operatic, begins well; two members of this oppressive tribe detest the entire clan and are eager to humiliate it. One is a defiant transvestite, who says that he's possessed by the soul of his dead aunt, and the other is the beautiful, restless wife of one of the glum sons. (Norma Bengell—who bears a stunning resemblance to Jeanne Moreau — brings strength and subtlety to a complex part.) Although the Brazilian director, Paulo Cesar Saraceni, has studied with Bernardo Bertolucci and Marco Bellochio; his extrav-vagent personas seems more akin to those of Federico Fellini.About halfway through the movie—after a botched suicide and a successful one—the narrative suddenly jumps 17 years and becomes thoroughly confusing. The characters haven't aged at all (although some of them have grown quite crazy). There's some incest afoot, but—due to the fact that a baby or two were born off camera—it's terribly hard to tell which mother is making out with whose son, and who did or didn't sleep with the gardener.However, the most impassioned couple hits the sack in such a public spot that their relatives needn't miss a single motion. (Despite the lack of privacy, this scene is extraordinarily, erotic.) But much of the acting declines into gusts of bitter laughter and stagey declamations, as hatred becomes the motivation for almost everything. Two characters rend their clothes in rapid succession, acorpse gets its face slapped—finally, we're in a realm beyond tragedy or lunacy, and the emotions have become too exotic to follow.The photography is magnificent throughout: the browns, blacks, and whites of the landscape simmer in contrast to the lush green gardens, and there's a daring shot of a lifeless body that recalls Mantegna's foreshortned view of the dead Christ. Although the movie doesn't fulfill the promise of its first scenes, let's hope that more of Mr. Saraceni's films are shown in this country.

Jenkins, the authors of the apocalyptic thrillers in the ''Left Behind'' series, have had their winning streak snapped. The pair's previous six novels all entered the Times hardcover fiction list at No. 1","excerpt":"their new one, ''The Rising,'' makes its debut this week at No. 2, behind James Patterson and Howard Roughan's ''Honeymoon.'' LaHaye and Jenkins's new book tells the not-so-cheerful story of the birth of the Antichrist to a literature professor named Marilena; it's the first of three planned prequels to the events of the first book in the ''Left Behind'' series. ''The Rising'' may not have landed at No. 1, but LaHaye and Jenkins remain an outsize force in the publishing world. The previous 12 books in the ''Left Behind'' series have sold more than 40 million copies; these guys have even sponsored a truck on Nascar's Craftsman Truck Series circuit. (This was probably a doomed experiment; who wanted to drive a race truck with the words ''left behind'' stamped on it?) LaHaye and Jenkins have not been bothered by critics who find their books anti-Catholic, anti-Jewish and anti-United Nations, or by those who've pointed out that their prose does not exactly crackle and pop. ''Pedestrian writing, thin characters -- I can handle the criticism,'' Jenkins told Newsweek's David Gates last year. ''I write to pedestrians. And I am a pedestrian. I write the best I can. . . . The literary-type writers, I admire them. I wish I was smart enough to write a book that's hard to read.''    PASSING IT ON: Like Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins, a lot of best-selling writers have learned to shrug off bad reviews. And maybe with good reason. According to a ''World Book Day'' survey released this month in England, only 11 percent of readers said they bought the last book they read for pleasure because of a review. (Seven percent said cover design was the deciding factor, and only 6 percent cited advertising.) What did drive these readers? Word of mouth. One in four of those polled said the last book they read was recommended by a friend or family member; only loyalty to a favorite author was mentioned as often. According to the survey, the top 10 word-of-mouth titles in Britain since 1997 include ''The Da Vinci Code'' at No. 1, ''The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time'' at No. 2 and ''The Lovely Bones'' at No. 3. For a bonus question, the survey asked readers to recommend a book for Prime Minister Tony Blair. More than a third thought Blair should pick up a copy of ''How to Win Friends and Influence People.'' The second most popular recommendation for Blair was just as cheeky. Eighteen percent thought he should buy, and reread, the 1997 Labor Party Manifesto.

Furthermore, it is not only the Baltic states that never chose to be associated with Moscow. This applies as well to the other republics, as the Soviets themselves are increasingly admitting. Even the Communist-controlled Georgian Supreme Soviet, before the recent elections in which the nationalists won, condemned the forcible Bolshevik takeover of that republic, which enjoyed independence between 1918 and 1921.

Armstrong (\\"Feuding Lawyers Get a Hearing","excerpt":"Their Peers, an Earful,\\" news article, Jan. 19) did, as your reporter correctly noted, turn into a credibility contest. It is often difficult to determine who is telling the truth in such a contest, but in this case it should be rather simple. Mr. Armstrong had told a reporter for Manhattan Inc. magazine that \\"one of the judges  [ at a Second Circuit judicial conference ]  had forbidden  [ Dershowitz ]  ever to return to his courtroom again. It was because of the way he behaved in the courtroom.\\"   At our debate, Mr. Armstrong said that in fact two Federal judges had excluded me from their courtrooms (at first he claimed they were both in the audience, but when pressed, he backed away from that assertion).   Excluding a lawyer from a judge's courtroom is a very serious matter. Federal courts, being courts of record, require that all rulings must be a matter of written record. If I had ever been excluded from the courtroom by a New York Federal judge -- which I most certainly have not -- it would be a matter of written record.   I challenge Mr. Armstrong to produce the records of the two judges he claims excluded me because \\"of the way  [ I ]  behaved in  [ their ]  courtroom.\\" He will not be able to, because the events that Mr. Armstrong said occurred never in fact took place.

Appealingly, this would not turn out to be a one-way traffic.

Since the film is its own mark of achievement, it must also be noted that, despite its commendable sincerity, it is often as callow as its principals' dedicated but fumbling efforts to make it as people and movie makers.Its title notwithstanding, this amalgam of documentary, cinema vérité and reenactment is the diary of Brandy (Michaux French) and Stanton Kaye. Through off-screen narration and onscreen dialogue, we follow Mr. Kaye (herein called Simon Weiss) through his early youth, in his drive to make movies in his native Los Angeles, his arrival here to join with his \\"patron,\\" Brandy, to make a movie","excerpt":"their personal relationship on a cross-country auto trip to her native Chicago and L.A. and back again in a strained affair that ends in apparent contentment complete with a baby daughter, cats and a dog.As noted, there are reprises of the action from Brandy's view as she falls in love with Simon but is flatly rejected by him long before the happy ending. And we are also introduced to their parents and friends in vignettes that, like the entire account in this movie about them and their movie, are often static and rarely emotionally equal to the muted anguish and trials projected by the dialogue.Miss French, a petite but unspectacular brunette, and Mr. Kaye, a largely placid type despite the problems, who reportedly are in their twenties, are obviously devoted to their film.
