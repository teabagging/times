If those assumptions change, an entirely new spreadsheet must be constructed.

Such nostalgia powerfully stokes today's $8 billion market for breakfast cereal, which is eaten by an estimated 80 million adults, adolescents and children daily. It's not surprising, given such numbers, that the cereal box has become practically a metaphor for artifice and packaging in modern American life. Yet it's the stuff inside that usually gets all the publicity, especially from nutritional critics who say a lot of it is just vile, sweet, overpriced junk. They overlook cereal boxes' cultural value.    Which you may not think much of either. Still, boxes can command hundreds of dollars on the nostalgia market. More important: \\"Walk into any grocery store, stroll down the cereal aisle, and you'll realize that cereal is more than a food -- it's an all-American form of entertainment,\\" writes Chuck McCann, the original voice of Sonny, the Cocoa Puffs cuckoo bird (\\"Wuuwk . . .

He wrote this in the foreword to \\"Cerealizing America: the Unsweetened Story of American Breakfast Cereal,\\" by Scott Bruce and Bill Crawford, a new book that tracks cereal's Elvis-like trajectory from turn-of-the-century wholesomeness to the corny excesses of modern times.

But as the popularity of the New York Cabaret Convention attests, there is a steady, loyal audience for the old songs and an abundance of performers who want to sing them. Last year the convention, an annual clearinghouse of cabaret talent from around the country put on by the Mabel Mercer Foundation, moved from Town Hall to fancier new digs at the Frederick P. Rose Hall, at Jazz at Lincoln Center. On Monday it begins its 17th season with the first of five consecutive early-evening performances that continue through next Friday. Each show has a different theme. The opening night show, ''Say It With Music,'' a tribute to Irving Berlin, has the strongest roster of talent: a partial list includes Klea Blackhurst, Judy Blazer, Barbara Carroll, Bill Charlap, Steve Ross and Sandy Stewart. Tuesday's show, ''Classic Cabaret Cross-Country,'' is a national showcase of mostly little-known performers, of whom the best known are Christine Ebersole, Amanda McBroom and Billy Stritch. On Wednesday Andrea Marcovicci, Ann Hampton Callaway and others will honor the cabaret legend Hildegarde. Thursday's show, ''It's Today!,'' is a musical grab bag whose strongest (and most familiar) talent is the singer Mary Cleere Haran. In ''The Glory of the Gershwins'' next Friday, the outstanding guests include Wesla Whitfield, Lumiri Tubo (above) and Julie Wilson. The typical Cabaret Convention evening is a marathon than can last up to three hours. Because the convention is a talent showcase, the performers run the gamut, from supremely gifted to marginal hopefuls.

But as part of its Haydn festival -- and as an educational gesture -- the Orchestra of St. Luke's has revived the work. In its production, directed by Barbara Pollitt, the story will be conveyed through shadow theater, projections and dance, with masked dancers and actors, and offstage singers, accompanied by the St. Luke's musicians.

Valery Gergiev conducts a musically authoritative and dramatically compelling performance. The cast is strong, with Galina Gorchakova, Olga Borodina, Dmitri Hvorostovsky and, in his first Russian role, the tireless Placido Domingo, who hurls himself thrillingly into the part of Ghermann.

Gavin Bryars, a British composer whose music vaguely relates to that of Busoni, medieval chant, early Steve Reich, modern jazz and the Edwardian salon, is represented by one of his strongest pieces, \\"Jesus' Blood Never Failed Me Yet,\\" in which the hymn of that name is sung on a tape loop by an emphysematic tramp and honored by a growing texture of orchestral support and listening. Works by Julia Wolfe, Pamela Z and Steve Martland are also on the program. Tomorrow night at 8, Alice Tully Hall, (212) 721-6500. Tickets: $25. (Griffiths).   CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY OF LINCOLN CENTER. Spirituality has become a force to be reckoned with in classical music, and it has been the principal interest of the English composer John Tavener since 1977, when he joined the Russian Orthodox Church. Mr. Tavener's fascination with the mystical side of religion has yielded a repertory of deeply beautiful works that have grown more expansive and lyrical with the years. His \\"To a Child Dancing in the Wind\\" is the centerpiece of a Chamber Music Society program that also offers the Mozart favorite, \\"Eine Kleine Nachtmusik,\\" and Dvorak's String Quintet in G (Op. 77).

The most unexpected visitors are the reunited POGUES, led by SHANE MacGOWAN. Formed in London in the wake of punk rock, the Pogues made common ground between the pugnacity of punk and the drive of traditional Irish songs: pennywhistle and accordion accompanied Mr. MacGowan's beery brawl and battered-romantic lyrics. But his tailspin into alcoholism led to the band's breakup in 1996. The group has reunited for a tour that includes four New York City shows.

The CHIEFTAINS, who brought Irish traditional music to the world, have long reserved St. Patrick's Day for Carnegie Hall. They started in the 1960's as traditionalists, playing old Irish tunes on old Irish instruments. Then they found fusions: with Celtic-rooted American country music, with Celtic music in Spain, even with Chinese music that uses instruments similar to Celtic lutes and flutes. On this tour, they are paying tribute to their harpist, DEREK BELL, who died in 2002; they are joined by stepdancers and a Celtic group from Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, the COTTARS.

And this week a few more veteran punk bands are coming to New York.    On Thursday RANCID  -- the long-running sequel to the short-lived late-1980's band OPERATION IVY  -- begins a four-night stand at the B. B. King Blues Club and Grill. Since the early 1990's Rancid has been bashing out beery, sing-along punk songs, sometimes leavened with ska or reggae. Thanks in part to the patronage of Green Day's Billie Joe Armstrong, a devoted fan who points a steady stream of Green Day fans in Rancid's direction, the group has built a solid career without much support from rock radio stations.    The specter of punk-rock patronage hovers over the opening acts too: for those four nights it will be the 1990's again. Thursday's opening act is H2O, the band led by Toby Morse, a former roadie for the influential New York hardcore band Sick of It All. Friday's opening act is THEO AND THE SKYSCRAPERS, the latest project of the indefatigable former lead singer of the Lunachicks, a ubiquitous downtown punk band of the 90's. On Saturday it's the LORDZ (formerly the Lordz of Brooklyn), one of a handful of punkish New York bands whose music prefigured the rock-rap boom of the late 90's. And on Sunday it's another punk-rock rapper (though he prefers the term ''thugcore''), DANNY DIABLO, formerly of Crown of Thornz and Skarhead. 8 p.m., 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan","excerpt":"sold out.

Last year's sensation, Arcade Fire, built an entire album around the idea of the funeral: the regret, the loss, the mystery and the life-goes-on. Now Band of Horses, a new group from Seattle that has a shimmering, guitar-drenched debut album, ''Everything All the Time'' (Sub Pop), also heads to the undertaker's for some rock 'n' roll salvation. The focal point of the record, the song ''The Funeral'' -- which, the band has said in interviews, is as much about death as it is about the dread of birthdays -- both soars and sulks, led along by sheets of electric guitars by Benjamin Bridwell (above, left) and Mat Brooke (right) that begin as teardrops and rise to majestic heights. ''At every occasion I'll be ready for the funeral,'' Mr. Bridwell sings in a voice high and thin, an acceptance that sounds both glum and joyous. The band makes a sweep through New York-area clubs this weekend, with Mt. Egypt and the Can't See as opening acts.

The guitarist and noisemaster Nick Zinner and the drummer Brian Chase carve out caverns of sound for the screecher-singer-high-kicker Karen O (above with Mr. Zinner, left, and Mr. Chase) to dance and strut around in, daring a listener to keep up with her. That might sound possible inside your headphones, but onstage she is as electric a performer as the downtown rock scene has produced in many years. The band's new album, ''Show Your Bones'' (Interscope), adds new textures like dry acoustic guitar, as Karen O sings -- really sings, not just screams -- about the glum aftermath of a failed affair. (''When you mean it on the inside you still can't get to me,'' she sneers in ''Way Out.'') But it's not a softening: dramatically and intensely the band always finds its way to a full-volume, heavy-as-Zeppelin erotic release. And you still can't keep up with Karen O, though it is impossible not to try. (Tuesday and Wednesday at Roseland Ballroom, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, 212-777-6800","excerpt":"sold out.)
