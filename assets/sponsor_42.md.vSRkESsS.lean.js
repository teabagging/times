This year, the strategy of trying to anticipate market moves was further discredited when numerous professional timers missed the August stock market rally. And to add insult to injury, a recent issue of the Harvard Business Review included an article entitled ''The Folly of Stock Market Timing.''   Essentially, investors who try to ''time'' the market sell off large chunks of stocks and switch into Treasury bills, or other safe havens, when they believe stocks have peaked and are heading down. But they must also know when to start buying stocks again and get out of cash instruments when stocks begin to head upward - and that often is the hardest turn to call. In contrast, most money managers are almost always fully invested in stocks or bonds, and tend to ride out the market cycles.

Ms. Rethorst has her own quiet but insistent choreographic voice. And the new quintet for women, danced in rather tatty practice clothes and without music, offers a clear view into Ms. Rethorst's fascinating work.    At first, particularly with the occasional sounds of Friday's last demonstrators and the police outside in the East Village streets, \\"Sometimes to Grace\\" looked like a series of inconsequential little movement sketches. A woman entered, sank to a crouch and cupped the air and floor with her hands as if in a dream, in a still, poetic image that also ended the dance. Another woman entered with a plain wooden chair, one of six that eventually made their way onto the stage to form, with alertly resting and moving bodies, a mysterious landscape. The women came and went in no very ordered-looking sequence. There were moments when they overtly acknowledged one another's presence.

L. Rothafel is conspicuous.The picture is called \\"Such Men Are Dangerous.\\" In the making of some of the air scenes for this production on Jan. 2 last, ten persons including the director, Kenneth Hawks, met death in a collision of flying machines over the Pacific. Warner Baxter, the featured player, and a man who doubled for him in a parachute leap were in a third machine far enough away from the accident not to be damaged. The pilot raced this machine back to the shore to summon rescuers.There is in this film an exciting flash of Mr. Baxter's double making a parachute jump from an airplane. It is an episode that not only recalls the tragedy of the film workers but also the mysterious death of the Belgian financier, Captain Alfred Loewenstein.Mr. Baxter is first seen in a marvelous make-up, with a prominent aquiline nose and a heavy, pointed beard. He impersonates Ludwig Kranz, a man of immense wealth and great power. The opening scene is devoted to the pretentious marriage of Kranz and Elinor (Catherine Dale Owen). As the married couple are coming out of the church, a girl happens to remark on Kranz's forbidding appearance. It is overheard by the bridegroom, who realizes that the girl was probably correct. That night Elinor runs away, leaving no reason for her disappearance. This causes Kranz to reflect further on his ugliness.Kranz is an individual who makes up his mind quickly. He decides to seek revenge on his wife for humiliating him. He tells his secretary to have a drawing account of $100,000 in three banks in Europe in the name of Pierre Veillard. He then orders his airplane and goes forth on a journey alone. While flying the Channel, he, unseen by the pilot, fastens on a parachute and then leaps from the machine to the sea.His disappearance is told with big headlines in the newspapers and the next thing the spectator knows is of his visit to Dr. Goodman, a famous plastic surgeon. Kranz, posing as Veillard, says that he wants his back straightened and his face improved. Can it be done? Dr. Goodman is reluctant to take the case. He is a humanitarian and believes first in attending to war cases. Kranz, however, offers him a check for ¬£20,000 and Goodman decides that as this money can go toward helping many worthy people, he will undertake the case.The next seen of Kranz is when his head is covered with bandages and, eventually, when he is thoroughly healed, he is the handsome Mr. Baxter. Dr. Goodman then returns to Kranz the ¬£20,000 check, as he realizes that this patient is the man who had contributed most generously to his war work.From then on until Kranz decides to uncover his identity to his wife, he is Pierre Veillard, a popular man with the women, and one who attracts even his own wife. Everything seems to have been given attention in this story except Kranz's voice, which one might presume would be recognized. His eyes have been covered with double-lens spectacles, his chin with a beard and his upper lip with a heavy mustache, but the voice is the same, except that after posing as the fascinating Veillard his tones are cheery.It is natural that Kranz's nature should change with his improved appearance. He has a taste for everything in a lighter vein, including clothes. People no longer look in awe at him, but smile. In the old days the financier never experienced a wholesome smile in his direction.This story was written by Elinor Glyn, and Ernest Vajda undertook to write the dialogue. Mr. Vajda has done exceedingly well with a minimum number of words.Mr. Baxter gives a serious and highly effective portrayal of Kranz, who in the end is told by Elinor that his soul was uglier than his physiognomy. Catherine Dale Owen is lovely as Elinor. Albert Conti does capital work as Kranz's secretary and Hedda Hopper makes the most of the part of Elinor's grasping sister. Claude Allister is amusing as a hen-pecked husband, an extravagant type, but nevertheless a merry specimen. Bela Lugosi gives a sincere performance as Dr. Goodman. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"Skin Deep.

As Captain Ira Bronson he seems to ask for trouble, but because the story has to be worked out in a certain way the men all are cowed. Bronson is the type of screen character who is only too ready to use his fists, and his son, Tim, is alluded to in a caption as a \\"chip of the old block.\\" Tim also delights in a scrap, and one becomes rather bored with the constant punches on the jaw that punctuate this yarn.The whole idea of the director and the author is to portray Bronson as a brute, and in that they succeed. He is averse to recognizing his own wife, whom he had deserted many years before the story begins. Tim does not know that the pale-faced woman is his mother, but she reveals this fact to him when he is endeavoring to embrace a young woman whom he has rescued from a none-too-pleasing saloon. Tim's harsh nature is supposed to be softened by this information.In the last chapter the bad ship Black Heron, with its motley crew, is caught in a presumably savage storm. The storm is not especially effective, for it seems rather as though the vessel had run into little more than a Scotch mist. Nevertheless, the characters go through the motions of making it appear to be a frightful gale.Mrs. Bronson has stowed away aboard ship, and she is on deck when Bronson orders his son, at the point of a pistol, to go aloft to furl a sail, Tim reluctantly obeys his father, and when he is high above the deck Tim misses his footing through the rolling of the vessel. Then Bronson's cruel nature changes as he thinks his son is going to crash to his death. The hard old mariner goes up to the young man's rescue, and he succeeds in getting Tim to a point of safety, but in doing so he, the old skipper, falls to the deck.Mr. Beery gives a strenuous and clever performance as the callous captain. Mrs. Wallace Reid is competent as the sad but determined mother. The story, however, aside from being implausible, is none too clear, and for that reason one is never greatly perturbed by the hectic events.

Perhaps it is coincidence, but several of the videos on display at Team Gallery refer to cinema. In ''The Abandonments'' (2005-6) a young man dressed as a dandy tap dances in the rain with an umbrella, an imitation of Gene Kelly in ''Singin' in the Rain.'' In ''Uncharted Settlements II'' (2005), shot at a ''Star Wars'' convention at the Indiana Convention Center in Indianapolis, the camera follows someone dressed as a storm trooper mingling with devoted fans, also dressed as their favorite ''Star Wars'' characters. But the most adventurous cinematic reference is to Stanley Kubrick's ''2001: A Space Odyssey,'' the inspiration behind ''Dark Night of the Soul'' (2005-6). The video tracks a figure in a space suit, above, wandering through the exotic scenery of the American Museum of Natural History after hours, to the poetic sound of a flute. The chic, odd camera angles suggest detachment, making the suited figure seem as if he were visiting some strange, remote world.
