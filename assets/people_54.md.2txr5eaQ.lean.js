But the great cultural effervescence that has taken place since the death of Generalissimo Francisco Franco in 1975 has infused Madrid with a new vitality that is just now coming to fruition.   This year the city is beginning what it hopes will be an annual event - a Fall Festival, or Festival de Otono of nearly 100 events over a six-week period. The festival will conclude Oct. 30 with a concert by the Vienna Philharmonic, led by Leonard Bernstein, in the Teatro Real. Among other events on the festival schedule: the Stuttgart Ballet will perform in the Palacio de Deportes nightly from Oct. 23 to 27; and the National Orchestra of Spain, accompanied by the famed Basque chorus, Orfeon Donostiarra, will play in the Teatro Real Oct. 29.

(By necessity, such a comparison omits the 1980-81 recovery, which lasted only one year.) For each of the five sustained recoveries since 1954, changes in long-term interest rates were rather subdued during this one-year expansion phase (see table).

A fiercely independent, selfdescribed perpetual student, died unexpectedly on November 30th from complications of brain cancer and stroke at age 88. Born in Newberry, South Carolina and raised in Norristown, Pennsylvania, Winnie arrived in New York City in the early 1940s, newly wed to Dr. Lloyd T. Barnes of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. While raising three daughters, she returned to school to complete the education denied to her in her youth because of her gender and race. She began her studies at Columbia, then New York University, where she earned a bachelors and masters degree in early childhood education, later teaching at The Dalton School and neighborhood public schools on the upper east side. Winnie also was a student of finance and investments at Temple University, the Bank of New York, and the New School for Social Research, as well as a student at GIA. With her husband of 50 years, she relished month-long trips to the exotic, including China, Russia, Japan, India, Iran, Egypt, Italy and France, each time making an extended study of the arts, crafts and culture of the region, including cooking and culture classes at the China Institute and Asia Society. She learned to handcraft rugs of oriental and middle eastern design by the latch hook method. After the death of her husband in 1993, Winnie devoted herself to the Hunter College Religious Studies program, where, immersing herself in study of religions of the world, she came to be regarded as a godmother to the religion program. Winnie served for 12 years on the board of the coop where her family resided for over 50 years, and was regarded as queen of the building. She was a long-time member of The Riverside Church, where her service included chancel flower chairperson, and arts and crafts department co-chairperson. Both Winnie and her husband were active members of the Boule and Reville Clubs.

Produced in the Soviet studios to celebrate the fortieth anniversary of Chekhov's death last year, these two vignettes of life in Czarist Russia are amusing bits of buffoon artistry.The better of the two—the one called \\"Marriage\\"—is a delightful little farcical satire on a marriage ceremony in a middle-class Russian home. And \\"Jubilee\\" is a broad, burlesque conception of a petty bank president's day, with his chattering wife and a garrulous woman disturbing his pomposities.

Into it the producers have seen fit to show how the yellow men work and how the white men play or idle. No white man is depicted doing anything but enjoying himself or virtually yawning, while the coolies are perspiring under the burdens. Even en a steamship that is being unloaded by the scores of stoic Chinese the director delights in turning his camera on the immaculate form of an officer in white leaning over the rail.When the foreigners of Shanghai are depicted having a game of lawn bowling, the Russian producer takes care to remind the audience that the Chinese are pulling rickshaws, unloading vessels or working at lightning speed in factories. He calls attention to the presence of warships and the British naval ensign flutters on the screen.But so long as one can ignore the propaganda, there is a good deal of Shanghai's activities set forth with imaginative camera work.\\"3 Comrades and 1 Invention\\" is a naïve Russian comedy and it elicited quite a good deal of laughter by its simple ideas of fun, such as an invention failing and the turning on of an improvised shower bath. It is quite well filmed and competently acted, though sometimes rather sluggishly.Two young men, Makhov and Akhov, invent a soap-box maker. They test it and it works like a charm, a box rolling out after the inventors have put into the machinery four sides of wood. But later, when they show it to the factory council, or some such body, the blessed thing won't work. Makhov and Akhov are disappointed, and eventually they discover that the mainspring is missing. It has evidently been extracted by an interested person who makes boxes for the soap factory.Makhov and Akhov are an ingenious pair. A log or two and other bits of trees and they have a navigable craft, with paddle wheels, to travel to town to display the wonderful box invention. On the way down the stream many things, some mildly comic, happen to them.The German one-reel film \\"Killing the Killer,\\" one of the most remarkable pieces of work that has ever been pictured, is still holding forth at the Cameo. It will perhaps be remembered that the exciting passage in this subject is the fight between a mongoose and a hooded cobra. Every time this film is shown it draws loud applause.

He led the nation through a great depression and a world war. He succeeded through a combination of, in the words of NBC News's John Hart, ''charm and politics, guile and deception.'' He was loved by his friends, who apparently represented the majority of Americans, and hated by his enemies. Oliver Wendell Holmes once said that Roosevelt had a second-rate mentality but a first-rate personality.  Even most of his detractors, however, will admit that he was a formidable leader. His New Deal policies laid the foundations for this country's current political state, much of which is now being questioned by President Ronald Reagan.

Like all pictures seeping over from England nowadays, it is more than a little infected with the virus propagandistus, but, over and above that common-carrier failing, it is a model of sheer incredibility crossed with what (carrying ing out the charity idea) we might designate as espionage melodrama. \\"Espionage\\" is a polysyllabic word for spy, and the word \\"spy,\\" even to some charitable students of melodrama, even in wartime, is a call to battle.Offhand, we should say that the chief distinction of \\"The Secret Four\\" lies in the internationally collaborative character of its auctorial department. And more than that, leaving out Angus MacPhail and Roland Pertwee, those imperialist suspects, we should felicitate that department on the acquisition of a talent who is certainly the most unpronounceable screen writer of the year, whatever his politics.

During his 21 years of service as chief executive from 1957 to 1978, Marlboro became one of the world's most valuable brands.

Additionally, a number of acquisitions in the consumer goods business, such as Miller Brewing Company, helped lay the groundwork for the company's successful diversification into the food business in the 1980s and 1990s. Under Mr. Cullman, the company also greatly expanded its philanthropic activities, becoming a significant contributor to the arts, among other areas. Mr. Cullman was himself a committed outdoorsman, conservationist and philanthropist, serving as chairman of the Atlantic Salmon Federation and on the board of the World Wildlife Fund.

And while past years have featured prominent players from the classical mainstream, this season kicks off refreshingly with Ethel, above, a young and often amplified string quartet that counts among its influences Led Zeppelin and Genesis along with Gustav Mahler. The program includes the String Quartet No. 2 by the omnivorous downtown clarinetist Don Byron (temptingly subtitled ''Four Thoughts on Marvin Gaye'') as well as works by each of the quartet's members. Oddly enough, even free series like this do not always fill the auditorium, but opening the new season with Ethel will at least help the series reach the younger listeners that should be its target audience. The concerts continue on May 28 with the Russian pianist Konstantin Lifschitz offering a rare two-part traversal of Shostakovich's complete Preludes and Fugues. The German violinist Arabella Steinbacher makes her New York debut on June 11 with a fiery Grieg-Schnittke-Brahms-Ravel program. And the guitarist Sharon Isbin teams up with the mezzo-soprano Susanne Mentzer for a mostly Spanish duo-recital on June 25.
