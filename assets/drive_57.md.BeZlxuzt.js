His idea is an excellent one, for this film provides both laughter and information.Although some of the talk was made when the pictures were taken, the greater part of the monologue was written by Robert E. Sherwood, playwright and screen writer, who has done his task in his usual effective fashion.This film reveals Mr. Fairbanks's activities in Honolulu, his first stop, and thereafter in Japan, China, the Phillipines, Siam, the jungles of India, Delhi and other places, after which the flippant and agile performer takes a leaf from his old production, \\"The Thief of Bagdad,\\" and rides, through camera wizardry, over Egypt, Italy, Switzerland, France, England and then home, not forgetting the pistol and machine-gun reports as he passes over Chicago.Victor Fleming, the motion picture director","excerpt":"Chuck Lewis, production manager, and Henry Sharp, a camera man, went with Mr. Fairbanks on this enjoyable journey. Aside from meeting celebrities, Mr. Fairbanks never misses an opportunity to have a game of golf and among the places in which he enjoys the royal and ancient game, are Tokyo and Bangkok. In India he goes on a big game hunt and brings down two leopards, saying after killing the last cat, that he had always wanted to put a leopard on the spot.First he is beheld having his morning constitutional aboard the vessel bound for Hawaii. It is safe to assert that few men could do the exercises Mr. Fairbanks sets himself on this stretch. In Honolulu, where, as in other towns, there are throngs to greet the film star, he meets Duke Kahanamoku, the champion swimmer, Sojin and Sessue Hayakawa, the Japanese actors. Then follow scenes in Tokyo, where Mr. Fairbanks shows a native maiden arising in the morning and having her hair dressed. In a studio \\"shot\\" Mr. Fairbanks makes a literal quick jump to China and having interested himself enough there, he goes on to Siam, where he is entertained by King Prajadhipok, whose name he pronounces without the least hesitation.But it is in India, in the realm of the Maharajah of Cooch-Behar, that he has his thrilling experiences in shooting big game from the back of an elephant. Here there is also a clever fantastic bit, depicting Mr. Fairbanks's dream. A tiger appears prowling around, and after chasing persons and picking up something that looks like a convenient dummy, lo and behold one perceives Mr. Fairbanks going after the big cat. He loses his gun, but what of it? He continues to give battle to the wild beast with his strong hands. The dénouement comes when Mr. Fairbanks is seen fighting furiously on the floor of his tent with a tiger skin.In India Mr. Fairbanks enjoys the hospitality of the Maharanee of Cooch-Behar and the young Maharajah. These glimpses are especially interesting.The agile actor is also perceived standing at the door of the Taj Mahal and, what is rather jarring, one hears somebody singing \\"My Little Gray Home in the West.\\" At Mandalay Mr. Fairbanks is in a more reverential mood, for while the distant spot comes to the screen, with the \\"dawn coming up like thunder out of China across the bay,\\" one is entertained by the singing of Kipling's \\"Mandalay.\\"There are many other features in this compilation of scenes, which are always wonderfully entertaining.

Both are rich in dance history and offer lively, continuing forums for national and international dancers and choreographers.    The Pillow, as everyone calls it, got under way this year with a gala on June 18, running regular programs from last Tuesday through Aug. 28.    This week it features the MARTHA GRAHAM DANCE COMPANY, carrying on despite its recent upheaval in artistic leadership, in a fascinating early-American dance program. It includes early works of Graham with rarely seen dances by the pioneering Ruth St. Denis and Ted Shawn, with whom Graham began her career as a member of the Denishawn company. Shawn later founded Jacob's Pillow.    The Pillow's other ensemble is Australia's inventive CHUNKY MOVE, recently seen at the Joyce Theater in its ''TENSE DAVE,'' a cinematic exercise on a revolving stage.

Graham, $55; Chunky Move, $20.    The American Dance Festival takes place on the campus of Duke University. It began June 9 and runs until July 23, usually offering two companies per week, Monday through Saturday. This week is particularly exotic, with two foreign troupes. EMANUEL GAT DANCE from Israel, in a program that includes Mr. Gat's take on ''THE RITE OF SPRING,'' plays Monday through Wednesday at the Reynolds Industries Theater. Then the BRENDA ANGIEL AERIAL DANCE COMPANY from Argentina, promising a ''sensational exploration of flying, space and movement,'' filling the university's Page Auditorium, takes over through Saturday (a related article, Page 10).

And he went back to a wellspring of 20th-century culture, the rituals of black American churches: gospel music. The piece used the 12-part structure of a Protestant church service, and stretched to about 100 minutes, plus intermission.    Jazz composers like Charles Mingus have re-created preaching and prayer meetings with down-home, gospel-charged jazz. But \\"In This House/On This Morning\\" is closer in approach to Duke Ellington's Sacred Concerts, touching on spirituals and uptempo gospel among many other idioms. Without the program notes and Mr. Marsalis's comments from the stage, the music could be perceived as another of his recent large works that toy with styles from the most basic blues to the most abstruse hard-bop. He leads a septet -- with Wes Anderson on alto saxophone, Todd Williams on tenor saxophone, Wycliffe Gordon on trombone, Reginald Veal on bass, Eric Reed on piano and Herlin Riley on drums -- that can whisper and croon and strut, though it never shouts.
