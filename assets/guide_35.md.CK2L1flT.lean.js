Grace Is Inviting Tenders of Up to 180,000 Shares"},{"year":"1996","title":"W. R. Grace & Company said yesterday that it was under formal investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission over charges that it failed to disclose a reserve fund set up by its health care business. The S.E.C. investigation is the second now under way into the disclosure practices of Grace. The company, based in Boca Raton, Fla., previously said that an investigation was looking into allegations that Grace failed to disclose $24 million in retirement benefits given to its former chairman. The investigation involving the reserve fund focuses on accusations similar to those made by Grace's former internal audit chief in an age-discrimination lawsuit filed last  May. The former auditor, Norman Eatough, contends that Grace set up a reserve fund to avoid paying Federal taxes owed by the National Medical Care Inc. unit,  the provider of kidney dialysis services.
