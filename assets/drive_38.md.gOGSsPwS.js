Since tongues are supposed to be in cheek in this importation, one might expect the delicate nuances for which such Gallic comedies are noted. But such isn't the case in this whacky lampoon of the tribulations of a cocotte and her coterie. The mad pace of this stylized antic is wearying long before the happy dénouement and the plot convolutions are likely to be more confusing than hilarious.Claude Autant-Lara, who directed and will be remembered for his sensitive work in \\"Devil in the Flesh,\\" as well as his scenarists, Jean Aurenche and Pierre Bost, have leaned heavily on slapstick and speed in the Mack Sennett tradition and have managed to avoid tickling the funny bone.In adapting Georges Feydeau's turn-of-the-century boudoir romp, \\"Occupe Toi D'Amelie\\" (\\"Take Care of Amelia\\"), they are relating the storyéin terms of a photographed playéof a fickle Parisian damsel of easy virtue, who is happy in her chosen calling. But since she is carefree, she is willing to be squired by the friend of the young officer who is paying her rent while her patron is away for a month serving his country.Thereafter the involvements are many. The young man, a rake in love with a married woman, is anxious to get married in order to inherit his fortune, a legacy held in trust by a bucolic Belgian uncle. The heroine, a lady apparently amenable to almost anything, is charmed by a Balkan prince, and, later, agrees to a \\"mock\\" marriage to the frenzied hero arranged by the conniving officer. Since true love does finally find a way, one can suppose that things turn out happily for all concerned. But it is a long time coming.Danielle Darrieux is beautiful and lively as the beleaguered mistress, and Jean Desailly, as the \\"chaperon\\" for whom she falls, also is properly harried and handsome. Andre Bervil, as her patron, who finds that his friend has taken his job too seriously, adds a comic touch or two, and Victor Guyau, as the uncle","excerpt":"Aslan, as the roguish royal admirer and Carette, as the venal father, athletically attempt to keep things moving.

My house cat seems to spend most of the day asleep. Why? It would seem that animals are most vulnerable when asleep and therefore would evolve to sleep less and less.   A. Since we cannot interview cats about their habits, there is so far no way to be sure why they sleep so much. Carnivores, or meat eaters, in general sleep a lot, and scientists have speculated that there are evolutionary advantages attached to so much sleep. For example, carnivores tend to stuff themselves when they eat, and do not get hungry again for some time. If they wander around, they risk being seen by potential prey, who can then get out of the neighborhood","excerpt":"asleep, they advertise their presence as little as possible. Moreover, sleeping animals are often hard to detect in the wild; a carnivore small enough to be eaten by a bigger carnivore might actually reduce its risks by being asleep. In general, animals will tend to do whatever they can to reduce their energy demands; carnivores might save a lot of energy by sleeping except when hunting or eating.

Justin Lin, the writer and director of this shrewdly tense piece of storytelling, recognizes that sometimes it's good for a filmmaker to stir up trouble. He does so by taking the group most often orphaned into stereotypical behavior by teen films, Asian-Americans. Ben (Parry Shen), a naive grind of an overachiever, is pulled into an orbit of friends and small-time criminals. First comes a lucrative cheating operation, a hustle that gives the boys way too much spare cash to go along with their extra free time. And the kids find that their brains and ambition work just as well racking up the kinds of activities that don't look good on a college application. Their homeroom-based guile finally leads Ben, who eventually wants to break free, into one last, potentially liberating crime.

Common mud, or \\"earthen architecture,\\" to use the stiffer technical term, has come to the fore again as architects march backward in time in search of style and shelter.   An increasingly urgent question is how to preserve the relics of this primitive form of shelter, which grows so gracefully out of the earth from which it was dug, but which also melts when it rains, cracks when it heats and cools, flakes in the wind and shudders when the earth quakes.   Santa Fe sophisticates aside, more than 30 percent of the world's people still live in earthen homes, said Neville Agnew, scientific program director at the Getty Conservation Institute in Marina del Rey, Calif. The institute is a sponsor of the Sixth International Conference on the Conservation of Earthen Architecture here this week.   Not a few of the more than 300 participants who came from about 30 countries were surprised to learn from Richard Pieper, a New York architect, that many 19th-century homes in rainy upstate New York are really nothing more than bricks of mud beneath Greek Revival and Gothic Revival wooden skins.   That these houses could survive so long in such a hostile clime serves to underscore the versatility and durability of earthen architecture, often scorned in this and other parts of the world as a sign of poverty. But a new appreciation for its advantages over cement and wood is emerging: with foot-thick walls, an earthen home acts as a thermal stabilizer, damping daily temperature swings by keeping the warmth of the day at night and the cool of the night during the day.   Indeed adobe construction, which dates back 10,000 years, may serve mankind for centuries to come. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration, looking forward to human colonization of the moon, has considered building structures there by filling bags with moon rocks and dust, and stacking them up.   For now, though, the economic crisis in poorer nations has drawn attention to mud. \\"The housing problems of the Third World are such that we cannot ignore any technology,\\" said Hugo Houben, a Belgian who is vice president of the International Center for Earth Construction in Grenoble, France. \\"How are we going to build thousands of classrooms and hospitals?\\" he said. \\"We have got to revitalize local know-how and use it.\\"   It seemed both incongruous and fitting to hold the Adobe 90 conference in New Mexico, where multimillionaires live in splendid adobe-style mansions in Santa Fe only a few miles from primitive Pueblo Indian adobes that are still occupied nearly a millennium after their construction.   More than 500,000 Americans lived in 176,000 adobe homes in 1980, according to census figures, mostly in New Mexico, Texas, Arizona and California. About 1,500 new adobes are built annually. Given the labor involved, it is cheaper in this country to build a conventional home, but in drier parts of Africa, Asia and South America, mud is the cheapest and perhaps the only option for shelter.   Adobe is made by mixing clay, sand and silt and forming the mixture into bricks, which dry hard in the sun. In some countries the preferred technique is rammed earth, in which the mud mixture is piled into a wooden form that is removed when the mud is dry. In a third method, called puddling, layer upon layer of mud is applied by hand.   Sun-baked bricks are used in the American Southwest","excerpt":"asphalt or chemicals may be added to stabilize the mud. Sometimes straw is added to bind the mud and promote drying.   Adobes need much attention, especially after rains, but they hold up well if the roof and foundation are good. \\"All it needs is a good hat and a good pair of shoes,\\" said Paul G. McHenry Jr., an architect in Albuquerque.   But matters are far more complex when it comes to preserving archeological remains, all the more so because many earthen landmarks are still occupied. The ravages of time and neglect can be seen just 20 miles north of here in the remains of Fort Selden, a 19th-century Army outpost set in a clump of cottonwoods in the Mesilla Valley. The walls have crumbled, and only the outlines of the encampment can be discerned.   Nearby, 64 slabs of adobe stand on the parched desert floor like rows of ancient Mayan steles. They are part of two experiments in adobe conservation. On one side, Michael R. Taylor, an archeologist with the National Park Service, is trying different coatings, caps and foundations on 13 walls built five years ago, comparing their resistance to the elements with the resistance of a \\"control\\" wall that has had no special protection or treatment - \\"amendments,\\" as they say in the adobe game. These techniques are being explored as ways of preserving historic adobe buildings, but they might eventually be found useful in new construction.   Mr. Taylor has found, for example, that it does not help to top a wall with a cap of regular bricks overhanging the sides. A cap but serves only to dribble rainwater right into the mud, badly eroding the upper part.   Another concern is water entering from below by capillary action. No concrete apron or foundation has worked, Mr. Taylor said. \\"We have not come up with anything better than keeping the water away with a good slope away from the walls.\\"   Nearby is a more elaborate experiment started two years ago by the Getty institute. Lined up in three rows, 51 test walls are subjected to a variety of stresses including spraying and wind. Each wall has a different protection, like a chemical treatment or a textile canopy, except for one control wall of adobe.   Mr. Agnew of the Getty institute said that injecting either of two chemicals into the walls proved highly effective in consolidating the adobe and retarding decay. These are alkylalkoxysilanes, similar to bathtub caulking, and diisocyanates, used in the manufacture of certain paints. These chemicals react with moisture and bind to the clay.   One of the test walls stands under a tentlike structure made of a special synthetic knitted cloth, dun colored to match the desert, originally developed for horticulture. The wall under this \\"aerotextile\\" will be examined for wear over the next year or so.   Another approach to preservation is to rebury excavated structures, so Mr. Agnew is also testing \\"geotextiles\\" to wrap around archeological materials to protect them from moisture, roots and insects until they are dug up again for study.   But debate rages among experts over the use of chemical or other irreversible preservation methods on archeological sites. \\"To experiment on an object is a very serious thing; you can totally destroy it,\\" said Alejandro Alva Balderrama, an architect with the International Center for the Study of the Restoration and Conservation of Cultural Property, an international agency in Rome.   He cited the case of earthen remains at Gela, in Sicily, that were destroyed because a plastic tent put up to protect them created an unexpected microclimate. He and other experts favor regular maintenance, by which new mud plaster is applied to shore up decaying structures.   Mr. Agnew of the Getty institute strongly dissents. Regular maintenance for occupied earthen structures like the casbahs of North Africa is appropriate, he argues, but not for abandoned old sites. \\"After 100 years of mud repair, you don't have a historic object anymore,\\" he says. \\"If you can find the right chemical, combined with shelter, you can minimize damange to the historic fabric.\\"   If chemical treatments to preserve ancient earthen architecture are controversial, such constraints do not apply to new construction. The rub here is money. Mr. Houben of the Center for Earth Construction in Grenoble helps developing countries build housing. Mud and labor are cheap in those countries, but they cannot afford the stablizing chemicals. They must turn to local resources and know-how, he said, adding, \\"What we stabilize with is gray matter, not cement.\\" For Adobe, Whether Humble or Fashionable, It's Mud to Mud"},{"year":"1922","title":"The Harlem River Speedway, formerly reserved for the exclusive use of horsemen, is now being paved.
