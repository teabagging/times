An extraordinary trumpet player, he has often been faulted for not having the experience needed to lead a band. Mr. Hargrove, these critics say, was pushed into the limelight by his recording label, groomed for stardom but not prepared for the responsibilities. If Mr. Hargrove's first set on Tuesday night is any example, he has been paying attention to those critics. He has fashioned a taut and precise band and constructed an exciting, carefully arranged set that led off the group's improvisations.   The set opened with two pieces from his new album, \\"The Vibe\\" -- the title song and \\"Caryisms.\\" Played together, they resembled a suite and moved through a liquid transition that had an aura of unpredictability to it. At times the group's drummer, Greg Hutchinson, stopped playing, leaving the piano and bass to play alone","excerpt":"tempos changed and the group's dynamics crested and fell.

In direct antithesis to Cecil B. De Mille's historical spectacle now at neighborhood theatres is this imported curio, made in 1943. Produced by Italo Tancredi and released by Anna Careggio Corporation, it frames a small army of players in ten contemporary, dramatic vignettes, while sternly echoing the Deuteronomy laws.Piety and sincerity are admirable, so is good acting. But so, in a movie, is shrewd showmanship, which is why Mr. De Mille remains a good ten miles ahead of this two-and-a-half hour Italian job. Its most intriguing aspect is the chance to study such people as Valentina Cortese, Rossano Brazzi and Massimo Girotti in action some fifteen years ago.The real disappointment is that an ambitious film, applying such basic wisdom to so many levels of modern society, could be so short on imagination, originality and even wit. And if the vintage sound track seems a bit muffled and scratchy, so does the direction of G. W. Chili, especially with the human nuances of his ten narratives.Of the two sections on covetousness, one skittishly shows a country lass almost trading her honor for a bracelet. The other, a potential triangle around a neighbor's wife, is sensitively played by Mario Ferrari, Bella Starace Sainanti and Mr. Girotti. The thievery episode has a solid performance by Roldano Lupi, as a \\"black sheep.\\" In a coy \\"Sabbath\\" portion, a child re-unites her parents.The law on idolatry provides a stark close-up of a doomed financier. Just as glum is the tale of a village feud killing, with, incidentally, the picture's one unexpected story twist. The adultery sequence, featuring Mr. Brazzi, is dank, dismal and embarrassing.In a sourly exasperating slice of life that takes the cake, a nice teacher and gentle priest are disgracefully hounded and some sneering \\"false witnesses\\" casually exonerated. The victims, Assia Noris and Carlo Campanini, are so well played that it hurts. The nearest thing to drollery is the fate of a society figure who snubs his simple parents only to have his daughter elope with a swineherd. Clumsy treatment ruins it.In the best and shortest fragment, on blasphemy, a crippled painter loses a lovely neighbor to nunhood. Miss Cortese and Ugo Sasso are truly touching in this spiritually perceptive cameo, skillfully sketched by D. Fabbri, the scenarist.Ten is a tall number for an episodic picture in any language (even with competent English titles). And the crammed contents are linked ponderously in a long, warning movie sermon that has authority but little power.

It would be both visible and accessible, offering the passerby proximity to posterity.    Ezri Tarazi  A shell of polished white concrete would encase 110,000 gallons of oil -- enough to keep a memorial flame lit for 365,000 days. The capsule would rest inside the tank. When the fuel runs out, the capsule would be revealed. An enduring flame, seen in every synagogue, accords with Tarazi's background as an Israeli Jew. He is the designer of, among other things, the gas masks that Israelis wore during the gulf war.    Benjamin Strouse, Eric Liftin, david reinfurt, Michael Rock and John Stewart  These Internet and design specialists propose a way to turn the ephemeral Internet into a lasting global network of time capsules. They would establish a Web site and invite anyone creating any kind of capsule anywhere to send in the coordinates. The Web site operators would then send each registrant a metal disk inscribed with the locations, so a future discoverer of one capsule would know where to look for all the others.    Zaha Hadid  The internationally known Iraqi-born architect brings a new approach to the traditional time capsule torpedo. Her proposal takes the form of a titanium dart, to be concealed within a rock formation in Central Park. Artifacts would be packed in metal modules stored in bubbles of borosilicate glass. The bubbles would be protected by a space-age fabric bladder filled with argon gas.    Gaetano Pesce  What lasts a millennium? Sequoia trees, says this Milan artist and designer. He proposes using lasers to engrave microscopic characters on the trunks of saplings. As the trees mature, the writing would become progressively more legible until people a thousand years from now could read that, for instance, John loves Mary.    IDEO  By contrast with designs that would hide the capsule, the proposal from this Palo Alto, Calif., industrial design firm -- specifically, Blaise Bertrand and Craig Syverson -- purposely exposes it. People would be encouraged to post, paste and paint on the six-foot kiosk that contains the capsule. Over centuries, the column would bulge with layers of protection -- and information.    Morphosis  Like several other proposals, this one from a Santa Monica architectural firm would use Central Park as a depository. The striking aspect of the proposal is how to record the site. The designers would print a location map on the most mass-produced object in the world: the Coca-Cola can, 4.5 billion of which are produced each month. Of these, the designers reason, at least one should make it to 3000.    Greg Lynn and Jeffrey Kipnis  This design resembles an Issey Miyake dress, for Lynn and Kipnis propose that the future measure of beauty will be voluptuousness. They would create 99 capsules to be installed, one a year, through New York City. Each capsule would differ in shape as well as in content. The data would be encased in thermoplastic containers, and then stowed inside a metal casing. The casing, in turn, would be scored, like an LP record, with grooves and ridges that would produce sound when played with a stylus.    Lindy Roy  This South African-born architect proposes creating 1,000 metal eggs, each a foot high and honeycombed with a series of interior compartments. The eggs would be distributed as heirlooms that could be reopened and augmented by each generation for the next 1,000 years.    Pentagram  Give me your tired, your poor, your oversize accessories. Pentagram, the New York design group, has done the gallant thing with its capsule -- carefully insulated, packaged and sheathed in metal, and then hidden in plain sight.

His new film, \\"Gates of Paris\\" (called \\"Porte des Lilas\\" in France), is a touching indication of it. It opened at the Fine Arts yesterday.Where M. Clair was often mocking and ironic in the past, in such sparkling films as \\"Le Million\\" and \\"A Nous la Liberté,\\" he is tender, good-natured, facetious and not a little sad in this. His theme is the force of human kindness and the value of helping others with a little love.As he did in many of his previous pictures, notably \\"Sous les Toits de Paris,\\" he has chosen a corner of Paris and a handful of Paris types to represent the cosmos he is thinking about in this film. The corner is a working-class area near one of the ancient \\"gates,\\" and the people are workers, one criminal, bistro denizens and a genial bum.This bum is the principal character, for it is he, a neighborhood joke, who does the amazing and audacious thing of giving a secret hiding-place and home to a notorious fugitive criminal who is trapped in the neighborhood. And it is he who acquires new strength and happiness by helping this man in need, then turns on the ingrate and destroys him when the latter attempts to betray a loving girl.This may sound like a solemn melodrama, and in some of its details it is a little strong on the heavy business of violence and guns. But always M. Clair is the mellow and droll observer who finds the goodness or homely human failings in the best of his characters.Pierre Brasseur as the neighborhood \\"stupide\\" constitutes the most appealing of these, combining a sweetness of nature with his heavy and clumsy ways. As the girl whom he hopelessly worships and who later falls in love with the crook, little Dany Carrel is as attractive as, and a much better actress than, Brigitte Bardot. Henri Vidal is handsome and dynamic, with a touch of gentleness, as the crook, and Raymond Bussièrres is heavily Gallis as the bartending father of the girl.As a melancholy guitarist, M. Clair has Georges Brassens, a well-known Parisian cafe singer of anarchistic songs. M. Brassens, according to the stories, has never hidden his hatred of the cops—\\"les flics\\"—who are the villains in this picture, and his surliness comes out in the film. He makes perhaps the weakest and least appreciable of all the characters. His principal contributions are some moody, guitar - accompanied songs.Indeed, it is too bad—and surprising—that M. Clair has not employed more music of the sort that M. Brassens sings, or of a more poignant nature, through the film. For this is a picture and a subject that cries for the musical refrains and the complements of melody that used to feature M. Clair's earlier films. It is bitter-sweet and sentimental, a reflection of the Paris that lived under the rooftops and in the bistros. M. Clair should have given us more songs.But \\"Gates of Paris\\" is, without them, still a genial and wistful film. It is in black-and-white, which is appropriate, and the English subtitles do their job.
