In accordance with military policy, celebrations of Hanukah as well as Christmas will be muted in deference to the Muslim nation's beliefs.   There are from 500 to 800 Jewish soldiers, sailors, marines and airmen in the American force in Saudi Arabia, according to Rabbi David Lapp, director of the JWB Jewish Chaplains Council. He said there are currently two Jewish chaplains on the land and two at sea in the Persian Gulf area.    Hundreds of menorahs, candles and Hanukkah gifts were sent by Jewish organizations, schools and individuals in advance of the holiday, although, again out of deference to the Saudis, some were careful not to ship products made in Israel. The Saudis have allowed the shipments.    Margery Wise, the owner of the Jewish Quarter, a Judaica shop in White Plains, N.Y., that shipped 300 menorahs to members of the armed forces, said she got the idea after watching a news program about Christmas gift packages being prepared for shipment.   \\"People don't think there are many Jews in the military, but there are a lot more than we think,\\" she said. \\"And because the whole celebration is low key, we wanted to be sure they wouldn't get lost in the shuffle.\\"  Mozart and Sacred Music     When officials at the Eastern Baptist Theological Seminary in Philadelphia found a long-lost Mozart manuscript in a seminary safe last summer, they agreed that it should be sold to raise money for the financially strapped school. But there were many suggestions about what the proceeds should be used for, including efforts to strengthen the theology department, to build a new library and to reduce tuition costs.   In November, after the manuscript sold for $1.7 million at an auction at Sotheby's in London, the president of the seminary announced that he and the board of trustees had found an appropriate use for the proceeds.    The president, the Rev. Manfred Brauch, said most of the money would be used \\"to provide a strengthened offering in the area of sacred music,\\" including \\"programs involved with the place of music in the life and worship of the congregation.\\"   The seminary received the 14-page Mozart manuscript in 1950 from the family of William Howard Doane, a 19th-century Cincinnati hymn writer and industrialist. It had been left in the seminary safe since 1957. The pieces on the manuscript, the \\"Fantasy in C Minor\\" and the \\"Sonata in C Minor,\\" were already well known, but the manuscript included original music not found in other versions of the pieces. It was reportedly purchased on behalf of a group of Austrian cultural organizations.  What's in a Symbol?     If there is a cross atop a mountain near a city, is it appropriate for the symbol to appear on official vehicles and uniforms in that city? Or is the use of the cross, and perhaps the cross itself, an unconstitutional endorsement of religion?   Those are some of the questions before a Federal District Court judge in California who is hearing two lawsuits about a tall concrete cross on Mount Helix in San Diego County.    The case began last year after the police and fire departments of La Mesa, Calif., changed their insignia to give new prominence to the cross on the nearby mountain. The cross had occupied a much smaller place on the previous emblem, which remains the seal of the City of La Mesa.   Betty Wheeler, the legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union chapter in San Diego and Imperial counties, said that once her office decided to challenge the new insignia it also decided to tackle the separate question of the constitutionality of the cross itself.   The Mount Helix cross, which is 35 feet tall, was built in 1925 on private land that was subsequently deeded to San Diego County along with an adjacent nature theater.    Because of their similarity, the two cases were heard together before Judge Gordon Thompson Jr. in San Diego. Both sides have submitted briefs and are awaiting a decision.    In the past, Federal judges have handed down a variety of rulings on the display of such religious holiday symbols as nativity scenes and menorahs on public property.    Ms. Wheeler argued that the California case was a violation of the Constitution because the cross and the insignia are \\"permanent, year-round\\" objects, and are \\"much more fundamentally and profoundly a symbol of the Christian religion in a way that holiday scenes are not.\\"    But John Meyer, a lawyer representing La Mesa in the case, said the insignia does not imply endorsement of Christianity by the police and fire departments. \\"If Mount Helix had an avocado on top of it, it would depict an avocado,\\" he said.

He is a poet with the camera, a master of an almost forgotten virtuosity.To be sure, Senhor Barreto had a nicely pictorial locale and an amazingly colorful group of people to vitalize in this film. His Cangaceiros are such caparisoned brigands as used to roam the northern ranges of Brazil, pillaging, resisting law and order and sometimes playing the boastful roles of Robin Hoods. And the country is dry and dramatic, like some of our own Western locales. The material is highly inviting and the director does it proud.When his bandits attack a village, they do so tremendously. When they slap a hot brand on a captured woman, the act is more violent than a rape. When his proud and pigheaded bandit leader orders the \\"gallop\\" torture applied to a pitiably pleading peon, he does so with an arrogance that makes one cringe. All the actions of the bandits in this picture are terrible and frightening.And when they gather for relaxation and the enjoyments of the dance, there is a passion and wildness in the rhythms that make the blood run cold rather than hot.All this contributes to the vigor and beauty of this raw outdoor film, apart entirely from the story, which is obvious and pat. It is the story of a violent animosity that slowly grows up between the bandit leader and his fine young lieutenant when the latter takes pity upon a beautiful school teacher whom the bandits have carried away. This romantic situation leads to obvious tragedy when the lieutenant runs away with the lady, is pursued by the band and eventually killed.However, an excellent bit of drama is used for the final episode, and this does a great deal to lessen the tedium of some lengthy boy-girl scenes.Most striking figure in the picture is the bandit captain, whom Milton Ribeiro, plays with a fine, ugly, evil-eyed fierceness that nails you down in your chair. Alberto Ruschel as the young lieutenant is a solid fellow, too, and Vanja Orico as a bandit-woman is not the type you'd like to meet in the dark.The musical score is thrilling—a fit one in every way. This \\"Cangaceiro\\" is a picture that will cause the Western fans to rub their eyes.

The people of the Central African Republic no longer see much of Bokassa since he is incommunicado (with a death sentence commuted to life imprisonment) in a tiny cell.

Because prions don't jump easily from one species to another, the researchers say the protective effect probably arose from frequent eating of human flesh, rather than of infected animals.

The isolated house is magnificent but decrepit Victoriana, not beyond the power to attract—especially Marian. And the price is right. Nine hundred dollars. Not a month. But for the whole season.Ben thinks there must be a catch, and what about the housework? \\"The house takes care of itself,\\" says the woman who, with her rather dotty brother, is offering it for rent. There is, of course, octogenarian mom at the top of the house. But she's no trouble. Just leave a tray outside her room at mealtimes. Marian agrees. She'll care for mom herself.And so begin the events of \\"Burnt Offerings,\\" which opened yesterday at a number of theaters, an excursion into eeriness led with admirable though not perfect assurance by the director, Dan Curtis.Here is the house as vampire—alluring, renewing itself on injury, violence and death","excerpt":"capable of menance, vengeance, outrage and murder.To it, in all innocence, come such solid actors as Karen Black as Marian; Lee Montgomery as her son, David; Bette Davis as Ben's old Aunt Elizabeth, and Oliver Reed, as Ben, who is subject to nightmares about a childhood funeral, one of those old-fashioned glass-sided hearses and a chauffeur (Anthony James) whose face is going to haunt a lot of dreams for months to come.Director Curtis times his audience immersions into the ice bath of terror with such skill that moviegoers will scarcely have the leisure to ask why some of the renters aren't a bit more observant and curious about their dwelling.Only at the end does Mr. Curtis falter. Part of the climax is predictable; and, in another part, he relinquishes his deftness in favor of violence and gore on a scale that clashes with his earlier restraint.Nevertheless, such is his ability that, at the approach of the denouement during a preview of \\"Burnt Offerings,\\" members of the audience began murmuring and shouting nervous jokes in a vain effort to break the undeniable tension.Rental agents hereabouts should get down on their knees and give thanks that \\"Burnt Offerings\\" is opening now. It's the kind of movie that does for summer homes what \\"Jaws\\" did for a dip in the surf.The PG rating (\\"Parental Guidance Suggested\\") seems attributable to one long shot of Marian diving nude into a swimming pool; to a couple of scenes indicating the state of Ben's and Marian's sex life, and, perhaps, to the climactic gore.
