The fact that investors have continued buying notes and bonds, even as yields fell below 13 percent, has led analysts to conclude that the Treasury's new issues might be sold without the large drop in prices and increase in yields that has preceded other major Treasury financings this year.    The size of the Treasury's borrowing program next week is in line with market predictions.

Despite the large reputation enjoyed by Mozart, the underdogreputation borne by Salieri and the provocative nature of any Antheil work, the work by Elliott Carter is likely to be most significant.   The Mozart work is 28 measures of march music, written in 1782 for ''Die Entfuhrung aus dem Serail.'' It will be presented by Newell Jenkins in his Clarion Concerts next Wednesday in Alice Tully Hall.  The ''Marsch der Janitscharen'' was discovered two years ago in Berlin by Gerhard Croll, director of the Musicological Institute of the Univeristy of Salzburg, who came upon it in a Viennese copy of ''Entfuhrung.'' The brief march accompanies the Turkish soldiers' arrival onstage before they greet the Pasha. In future performances of the opera it will, no doubt, provide the Janissaries with more relaxed entries, as printed scores of the opera provide only nine measures of music for the massive stage action.

''The Japanese, the Western Europeans and a lot of others now see not only how callously the Kremlin has handled this episode,'' a White House aide said, ''but also, by extension, how dangerous it is to trust their good will on other questions like arms control.

The flow of arms began only a few months after the American hostages seized at the United States Embassy in Teheran in 1979 were released on Inauguration Day in 1981. The United States specifically authorized Israel to make the sales to Iran for a period that by different accounts ranged from 6 to 18 months. But the United States watched them continue after that, even as the Reagan Administration aggressively promoted a public campaign, known as Operation Staunch, to stop worldwide transfers of military goods to Iran. First Evidence of Link    Occasional published reports since 1981 have linked Israel to the sale of some American-made arms and spare parts to Iran in the early 1980's, but no United States Government authority for those sales has been publicly demonstrated before now. The change in policy came before the Iranian-sponsored seizure of American hostages in Lebanon began in 1982, eventually leading the White House to trade arms for hostages in the Iran-contra affair.

One warning was delivered by Thomas R. Pickering, the American representative at the United Nations, to Abdul Amir al-Anbari, the Iraqi delegate.   The Iraqis deny any intention of using chemical weapons, but United States officials noted that President Hussein has named a new Interior Minister, Ali Hassan al-Majid, who is accused by human rights groups of overseeing chemical gas attacks on Kurds in March 1988.    United States officials expressed hope that their warning, backed by the fact that American and allied forces occupy 20 percent of Iraqi territory and have dominion over the Iraqi skies, will deter Baghdad from using chemical arms on the rebels.  No Final Decision     The Administration officials did not specifically state publicly what actions American forces might take if a chemical attack against Iraqi civilians was detected, and no final decision had been made on the military options.   But they said the main recommendation drawn up at meetings held on Friday by the National Security Council to discuss the situation was for resuming air strikes rather than renewed ground attacks from United States forces in Iraq.    \\"The ground option is definitely precluded,\\" the official said, \\"That leads into the destruction of Iraq, and we've said that won't happen. It would mean a longer ground war with the risk of backlash and casualties. An air strike was the most likely option.\\"    Another Administration official said there had been no meeting so far between President Bush and his senior aides to review the options.   The intelligence reports were based on intercepted communications between the Iraqi high command and field commanders, officials said. But no subsequent intelligence monitoring has indicated that such weapons have been used so far, despite claims from Iraqi opposition groups that their forces have suffered mustard gas attacks.   Any large scale use of nerve agents or mustard gas, a blistering agent with a relatively low death rate, has the potential to create thousands of casualties, officials said.    The state of Iraq's chemical arsenal remains a mystery to United States intelligence officials. After the nerve and mustard gas attacks threatened by Iraq did not occur during the Persian Gulf war, searches failed to yield the stocks of chemical weapons believed to have been deployed with Iraqi troops in Kuwait, one official said.   Chemical warfare experts believe that most of Mr. Hussein's arsenal of nerve agents has deteriorated in short-term storage and the factories where those supplies could be replenished have been bombed. However, Iraqi forces are believed to still have large amounts of mustard gas available.  Insurrection Continuing     The insurrection was reported to be continuing today in a number of Iraqi cities. The Baghdad Government pressed a campaign to put down the revolts using Republican Guard units flying helicopter assaults and directing tank and artillery fire against the rebels.    United States officials said the uprising was most intense in southeastern Iraq, where fighting was reported in as many as 20 cities and towns, and was most intense in Najaf and Karbala.   Also, an official said, the Baghdad Government now appears in no hurry to accept the repatriation of 60,000 or more prisoners of war being held in Saudi Arabia because it is feared these demoralized troops might join the insurrection upon returning to Iraq.   Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, traveling in Saudi Arabia, was the first high-level Administration official to speak publicly about the warning to Baghdad against the use of chemical weapons to put down the insurrection.    \\"We had reason to believe they might be planning such activity,\\" Mr. Baker told reporters Friday night. \\"We think it is important to warn them.\\"   One senior Administration official said that the intercepted Iraqi communication was very precise in its reference to chemical agents and, therefore, immediately set off alarms in Washington.   \\"We got an intercept on Thursday indicating that they were going to drop a gas bomb on a specific place at a specific time,\\" the official said. Referring to the diplomatic warning that followed, he added, \\"We told them in very explicit terms that this was something that would not be countenanced.\\"   Another official from an allied government said the intercepted communication was an instruction from the military high command in Baghdad to field commanders who were being urged to \\"use the liquids\\" because \\"time is not on our side.\\"    One United States official said that there were also indications that the Iranian Government, which supports the Shiite-based opposition in Iraq, had also learned of Iraqi plans to use chemical weapons and this might explain the call for Mr. Hussein's resignation issued Friday by President Hashemi Rafsanjani of Iran.   Teheran Radio reported today that refugees fleeing the southern Iraqi city of Basra said the rebellion had intensified. Southern Iraq is the stronghold of Shiite Muslims, who represent about a 55 percent majority of Iraq's population of 17 million and an overwhelming majority in Iran.  Kurds Claims Successes     Another 10 to 15 percent of the Iraqi population, largely in the northeast, is made up of Kurds, who have mounted several major rebellions in the last three decades to establish their independence from Baghdad.    Kurdish opposition forces claimed that the provincial capital of Sulaimaniya had fallen into their hands Friday with the defection and surrender of 5,000 Iraqi Army troops.   \\"The town was taken after government, Baath Party and security offices were overrun in fierce street fighting with Iraqi security forces,\\" a statement from the Iraqi Kurdistan Front issued in Washington said.   \\"Iraqi helicopter gunships attacked the population in the town center of Sulaimaniya with rockets and gunfire,\\" the statement said. \\"A dozen civilians were killed and many more wounded.\\" The Kurdish opposition claimed that seven additional Kurdish cities were in rebellion and had put the Iraqi Army garrisons to flight.    The Associated Press, in a dispatch from Nicosia, said that Iraqi Government forces bombarded Karbala for 12 hours on Friday. The news agency, quoting travelers and opposition members, said rioting had broken out in Baghdad on Friday after noon prayers at mosques in several sections of the city and that some protesters tried to march on the Presidential Palace.
