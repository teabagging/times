Among the more beguiling examples of the latter group are the tiny, decorative pamphlets that make up the Simple Cooking Series, distributed through the mail by a Boston publishing company.   John Thorne, by profession an editor of publications for the Massachusetts Department of Public Welfare, is both author and publisher of the pamphlets. A food buff whose interest in cooking began in his early 20's, he follows his fancies and writes each pamphlet on a single dish or type of food, including lore, hard facts on buying and handling ingredients, and recipes.

Iger, the president of ABC Entertainmentpredicted today.   In a press conference here today, Mr. Iger said the subject of scaling down the network had come up at some ABC business meetings, though he added that such a move was still several years down the road.   ABC, NBC and CBS currently program 22 hours of prime time programs a week. Mr. Iger said that cutting back those hours would become necessary because the shows that fill the \\"bottom half\\" of the weekly ratings list were now unprofitable.   \\"We need to reduce the burden on the networks to program those unprofitable hours,\\" Mr. Iger said. \\"I really do believe it will be tough for a network in the future to support 22 hours of programs.   \\"It would be to our advantage to rid ourselves of the less profitable hours.\\"   He said the network should \\"cede those hours to our affiliates.\\"   With a new season of prime-time programs around the corner, Mr. Iger said he was eager to proclaim good news about ABC's immediate future. But he spent most of his time here trying to put the past to rest.   Mr. Iger braced for the press conference during the three-week press tour here today, aware that as he put it: \\"I'm going to get beaten up about 'Thirtysomething' and 'China Beach.' I'm sure I'll still hear something about 'Twin Peaks,' too.\\"   Mr. Iger canceled those three highly regarded dramas this spring, prompting protests from supporters in the press and the viewing public.   The criticism was recently underscored when canceled series became the story of the nominations for this year's Emmy Awards. \\"Thirtysomething\\" received eight nominations, \\"China Beach\\" took six and \\"Twin Peaks,\\" four.    For Mr. Iger, the turnaround from praise to criticism has been especially abrupt. Only last year he was being celebrated in the press as the only programmer still trying to make innovative breakthrough television.   This year, he said, \\"I'm taking a lot of abuse.\\" He was smiling when he said it.   Mr. Iger, even-tempered and affable even when he is stepping into a bull's-eye, is taking the abuse in good spirit because he says he knows that it is the business, and not personal taste, that dictates decisions about which shows survive and which do not.   Still there have been some moments when the passion about these particular series has hit especially close to home.    In June, Mr. Iger vacationed in Hawaii. He was about to leave his hotel for a day of snorkeling when he passed through the lobby, carrying his snorkeling equipment in a bag prominently marked ABC.   A woman in the lobby saw the ABC logo and stopped him. She was irate, he said.   As Mr. Iger told the story: \\"She said: 'Do you work for ABC? Please tell me whom I can write to about canceling \\"Thirtysomething.\\" They've ruined my life on Tuesday nights. What kind of jerk would make a decision like that?' \\"   Responded Mr. Iger, \\"This is your lucky day.\\" He got another earful later in the month, about canceling \\"China Beach.\\" \\"I picked up the phone,\\" Mr. Iger said, \\"and my mother says, 'Robert, what can you be thinking?' \\"   The prospects for a two-hour movie continuation of \\"Thirtysomething\\" are \\"getting more and more remote,\\" Mr. Iger said.   ABC would like to do it and the production studio, MGM, would like to do it as well, he said. \\"But this,\\" he said, \\"is one of the more complicated deals I've dealt with this in this business, with a number of interlocking problems.\\"   He said the decision to cancel the series last spring came after a season when it was never clear what was going to happen with the show. \\"Some stars said they didn't want to go on","excerpt":"some did,\\" he said. \\"Some of the creative people didn't want to go on; some did.\\"   He said an important faction on the show wanted there to be \\"definitive closure\\" to the series in last year's final episode. \\"But MGM didn't want that,\\" he said. \\"They thought they might still sell it to us again or make new episodes for the Lifetime channel.\\"   Though he declined to give details of what \\"definitive closure\\" for the series would have meant, Mr. Iger said: \\"I approved the direction the creative people wanted to take in ending the series. We wanted an ending with impact.\\"    One star of \\"Thirtysomething,\\" Ken Olin, who played Michael Steadman, has said he was 100 percent sure that the series was completely over and that reprising his character held no attraction for him.    Mr. Iger, however, said one snag in the deal has been Mr. Olin's demand that he direct the movie.    All the stars and creators of the series would have been contractually obligated to remain with \\"Thirtysomething\\" had ABC decided to renew it. But once the decision was made to cancel it, they all became free of those obligations.   \\"It would be awfully hard to put it all back together again now,\\" Mr. Iger said.    By not being completely up to date on the news from the supermarket tabloids, ABC's programmers inadvertently opened themselves to criticism about another show, a new reality-based series called \\"F.B.I.: The Untold Stories.\\"   The series' producers sent ABC a \\"presentation\\" tape, sort of a shortened pilot, in the spring spring to show how the series would be formatted.   The case they chose to dramatize involved the contract killing of a judge in Texas. ABC's executive vice president of programming, Ted Harbert, said the network was completely unaware of the fact that the convicted killer in the case is the father of Woody Harrelson, who plays Woody Boyd, a bartender in the NBC series \\"Cheers.\\"    Mr. Harbert said this presentation would almost surely be turned into a full-length episode.   The connection between Charles Harrelson and his son, Woody, was widely reported by tabloid newspapers several years ago, and has also been extensively covered by newspapers in Texas.   To complete the odd circumstances surrounding this programming decision, ABC has scheduled the F.B.I. series to run opposite \\"Cheers\\" at 9 P.M. on Thursday nights.   A spokeswoman for NBC said today that the network would not comment on ABC's decision to run the show against \\"Cheers.\\" Woody Harrelson also declined to comment on ABC's F.B.I. series when asked in earlier reports in a Houston newspaper.    \\"There's no logic in saying we shouldn't play it against 'Cheers,' \\" Mr. Harbert said. \\"That's where this series is scheduled. Am I supposed to move it for one night because of this connection?\\"   Reporter's Notebook; Despite the Praise, These Shows Won't Be Back"},{"year":"2004","title":"Ten older American soldiers are among nearly 900 American soldiers who have died fighting in Iraq","excerpt":"some died of medical ailments that might have excluded them from earlier conflicts, others under fire in heat of battle; their deaths have created different landscape of grief since men leave behind total of 11 grandchildren, 21 decades of marriage, years of service to communities, mortgages nearly paid off and long careers that were already pointed toward retirement; table show all 10 casualties, showing age, rank, armed forces unit, date and place of death, and cause of death; photos (L) GRAY ELEGY -- The War's Oldest Casualties; In Iraq War, Death Also Comes To Soldiers in Autumn of Life"},{"year":"1956","title":"Wadsworth repts accord near","excerpt":"some differences reptd on makeup of govs bd AGREEMENT NEAR ON U.

A published history referred to the abandoned Penn Central rail yard as a \\"nursery for dreams.\\"   Such long-vacillating architectural visions in New York are certainly not unusual -- they number in the hundreds and probably encompass a major portion of the city's architectural efforts. But cheering the current railroad yard proposal is unusual. Not just from the lack of any meaningful direction for its advancement, but because current movement is in the    opposite    direction. Instead of \\"relocating\\" the roadway, a major rebuilding of the existing structure is about to proceed, and the potential for a huge park land development is another pleasant dream when we consider that the dilemma for the future will be how to maintain existing parks.   Does anyone actually believe that the $70 million newly renovated structure will be removed and the roadway relocated this century? The coalition of community groups should be congratulated for their imaginative design, but will the design be appropriate at a time well into the future?    Other goals and needs may then be of a much higher priority for this very large railroad yard area. For instance, environmentalists, concerned about the greenhouse effect and global warming, warn about potential rising water levels at the shoreline. This might require that the development be placed on stilts. Not to worry. The planning department's Special Manhattan Landing District, covering almost as large an area and planned well over a decade ago, though likewise unrealized, was also to be partially placed on stilts.   As housing, economic and social conditions in the city continue to decline and their ills compound each other, perhaps rationality and reason will return. What if this very large, repetitiously planned area, which has nevertheless so long remained a wasteland, could meanwhile provide a good deal of badly needed housing through mobile home placement? When the long-abandoned railroad yards really reach a point in time for actual renewal, the mobile installation could be moved to some other long-established wasteland. SEYMOUR B.

Every time we heard about a casualty, we were waiting for a call and fax from headquarters to come in. Every day, the anxiety was there. I have made five or six calls to families in our area. Some people are very quiet","excerpt":"some get angry at you. You're standing there in your uniform. They want to take it out on you. In this case, the first words we told his parents were, 'He is alive.' We visited them every day for almost two and a half months. I was wounded back in Grenada in '83. My wife was notified, so she gave me tips when the time came for me to make duty calls. She stressed over and over that if a soldier's wounded, just say 'He's alive' immediately.''   interview by Catherine Saint Louis   What They Were Thinking"},{"year":"1941","title":"Greeks harboring Brit soldiers face death penalty GREEKS AIDING BRITISH FACE DEATH IN ATHENS","excerpt":"Some Get Five-Year Terms for Giving Cigarettes to Prisoners"},{"year":"1941","title":"60 Negroes appear at office to apply for work","excerpt":"some get jobs ' SLAVES' LIKE JOB BUREAU; Hiring Center in Bronx Finds Work for 25% on First Day"},{"year":"1933","title":"Farm Pay Lowest in 34 Years","excerpt":"Some Get Only Room, Board"},{"year":"1945","title":"hanging decreed for 36 aides","excerpt":"some get prison sentences 36 DACHAU KILLERS TO DIE BY HANGING; Camp Commander and Doctor Among the Sentenced--3 Get 10-Year Jail Term"},{"year":"1958","title":"410 transferred to other schools PUPILS ARE BUSY IN LITTLE ROCK","excerpt":"Some Get Temporary Jobs -- Movies and Television Occupy Many Others"},{"year":"1945","title":"fraternization between GIs and girls, Schierstein and in Berlin, described FEW FRATERNIZE AS BAN IS LIFTED","excerpt":"Some GI's Stroll With German Girls but as Many More Decline Association Food Main Thought in Berlin"},{"year":"1923","title":"12 new types of aircraft being built Britain Builds 12 New Types of Navy Aircraft","excerpt":"Some Giant Boats Can Ride Roughest Sea"},{"year":"1959","title":"P Conerly article on pre-game habits, reactions of players ' Butterflies' Attack Pro Elevens Before Every Opening Kick-Off","excerpt":"Some Giants Discuss Plays While Others Meditate, but All Are Nervous"},{"year":"1939","title":"N Y C Business World","excerpt":"Some Gift Orders Canceled"},{"year":"1941","title":"U S retailers plan early gift promotions EARLIER START DUE IN HOLIDAY SELLING","excerpt":"Some Gift Promotions to Open Well Before Thanksgiving, the Usual Date"},{"year":"1939","title":"surveys, U S Business World","excerpt":"Some Gift Reorders Appear Dry Goods Jobbers' Stocks Low New Peak for Costume Jewelry Fluorescent Sales to Spurt Cool to Vandenberg Plan Hides Sell at Steady Prices Dual Duty Coat Sales Spurt Expect Gains in Grocery Sales Gray Goods Trading Light"},{"year":"2012","title":"A lot of interesting people with birthdays this week, including several award winning supporting actors","excerpt":"some gifted musicians; and a great basketball player who needed a haircut.

While Some Babies Are Burping, Others Are Making a Buck"},{"year":"1992","title":"A month with the Rangers leaves so many impressions, some perhaps debatable, including these:   THE LEADER: Mark Messier throws fewer body checks than ever before. Despite impressive statistics, his ineffective shifts are more than rare. But even when he seems exhausted and overworked, he pulls game-winning plays out of his back pocket the way a magician pulls quarters from your ear. It is impossible to understate the confidence he generates throughout the roster. These players revere him the way the Bruins did Bobby Orr.   THE REPORTER: John Davidson's Olympic hiatus was good for CBS, good for him and good for hockey on the national level. But he was missed on the air of the MSG network and in the corridors near the locker rooms at Madison Square Garden. Aside from Tony Kubek, what other former athlete takes his reporting role so seriously and does it so well?   THE FIGHTER: People who oppose fighting in hockey should hear the Garden crowd cheer and chant \\"Domi! Domi! Domi!\\" before and after Tie Domi throws punches. Some people go to the circus to see the clowns","excerpt":"some go to hockey to see the goons. No, that doesn't make it right. But when Domi is on the ice, he has everyone's attention, from the bench to the back rows.   THE CUSTOMERS: Speaking of back rows: When the league's best team is averaging more than 1,000 unsold seats a game for the season, and when tickets are unsold at the door for a high-profile team like Chicago, it suggests that hockey seats, in this economy, are priced too high for this market. Teams in smaller markets, with worse records and less advertising, draw a better percentage of capacity.   THE GOALIE: Where would the Rangers be without goalie John Vanbiesbrouck, who has started the last 12 games while Mike Richter has been injured? Vanbiesbrouck shakes off trade rumors, the occasional soft goal and the odd bad game with a mental toughness that is extraordinary.   THE IMPORT: Like many European players in their first North American season, Sergei Nemchinov seems to be tiring from the grinding number of games. After scoring 23 goals and 17 assists in the team's first 53 games, he has had only one goal and no assists in the last 11. He remains a diligent worker, but it is Darren Turcotte, with 25 goals, who is emerging as the No. 2 center. Will Nemchinov move over to the \\"checking line\\" and Turcotte go alongside Mike Gartner? The Rangers' depth is only adequate at this position and don't be surprised to see a fresh face, perhaps Rob Zamuner, getting a longer look there in the next few weeks.   THE FACILITY: There are minor league buildings with better ice surfaces and better press boxes than Madison Square Garden, but there are few pro teams in any sport with a better public relations department than the Rangers. Still, no amount of news-media savvy and sophistication can put a positive spin on unsafe work conditions for the players and a substandard work environment for the press. Hockey knockers in the news media who say this great sport is a bush-league business need not look any further than the most famous rink in the biggest city.   THE PLAYOFFS: Despite their undeniable success this season, the Rangers are hardly guaranteed playoff success. They still don't match up well with the Washington Capitals, who have a 4-2 record against them this season after bouncing them from the first round in six games last spring. This time, the Rangers could last four rounds or leave in four games. Impossible? Look up last spring's records, which showed the Blackhawks first over all in the regular season and among the first to exit in the first round of the post-season.   THE TRADING DEADLINE: General Manager Neil Smith now admits it was a mistake last spring to acquire Joe Kocur at the trading deadline and put pressure on him to be the enforcer. It damaged the chemistry of the team, as a major slump followed. Will that experience inhibit Smith at this year's March 10 trade deadline?   THE FUTURE: The Rangers might not be the team that pries Eric Lindros from the Quebec Nordiques, but it won't be for lack of effort. Their interest is frequent and serious, backed with money and players. As a junior, Lindros displayed a bubble-gum card of Messier on his locker. They became friendly at the Canada Cup last September. Now that he is 19 years old and much maligned, Lindros needs someone such as Messier as a mentor. The Rangers will be among the finalists in the bidding.

The Hotel and Motel Fire Safety Act of 1990 began to have an impact on the marketplace with a drastic revision of the Federal Travel Directory. This makes it the first guide to American lodging that lists only places that have a smoke detector in every room, wired into the hotel's electric system, and, in the case of buildings taller than three stories, have installed a sprinkler system. Battery-operated smoke detectors are unacceptable because batteries wear out and can be stolen.    The Federal Travel Directory has been published for years, but now the safety act dictates that it may list no American hotel or motel unless it conforms to the law's provisions. To accomplish this, the Government gathered a list of conforming properties from the states and territories and then purged from the Federal Travel Directory all the places not on this master list, shrinking the directory from 9,000 listings in December to 4,164 in January. Federal Travel Directory    The Federal Travel Directory is not a likely rival for the Mobil Guide or the A.A.A. Tour Book, because the type is pretty small and there are no pictures.

Madonna and Wesley Snipes are not.   So say residents of the photogenic brownstones that line the streets of Hamilton Heights. The well-kept buildings are full of the architectural details producers love: front steps and stoops, wrought-iron railings and window boxes.      But residents complain that many film crews block tenants from their homes, commandeer prime parking spaces and leave litter and damage behind. Some have even become a little aggressive. \\"There are people who will lean out their windows and bang pots when they start to film,\\" said Christina Lee, a member of Community Board 9.   Fed up, civic leaders are trying to set up a system in which those who film in the community board district would make some kind of contribution: donating library books, planting trees or giving money to neighborhood groups.   \\"Residents of the neighborhood make an extraordinary effort to preserve old buildings, to come up with gorgeous front stoops and front gardens, and do whatever is needed to make their neighborhood a lovely place,\\" Ms. Lee said.    \\"The film makers go in and film, leave their garbage behind, and disappear, never to be heard from again.\\"   As incentive to shoot movies and television shows in New York, the city offers free permits and help coordinating productions. The Office of Film, Theater and Broadcasting gives producers suggestions for filming sites, clears their plans with the sanitation and transportation departments and even provides protection through a 27-member movie and television police unit. The film makers pay for other expenses they incur, like moving parking meters or changing street lamps.    While film makers are encouraged to notify neighborhoods about their work, they do not have to, said Julianne Cho, a spokeswoman for the film office. Regarding donations, she said: \\"That's an arrangement that would be made outside our office. There is no precedent in our office for this kind of thing.\\"    On his own, Mr. Cosby gave $1,000 to the Convent Avenue Neighborhood Association after filming his television mystery show there last summer, and residents say the entertainer kept inconveniences to a minimum. By contrast, residents say the crew of a movie starring Mr. Snipes tried to block residents from their homes on Convent Avenue between 143d and 144th Streets.   Also last summer, when Madonna shot a music video at 270 Convent Avenue, residents say crew members tried to keep them from entering their lobby, and then mistakenly told owners of the co-op apartments that they had gained permission from their landlord to do so.   \\"There were some hard feelings and also a confrontation,\\" said Wil Buckery, treasurer of the Convent Avenue Neighborhood Association. \\"A member of the board of directors of the building had to approach the Madonna people and sit down and talk eyeball to eyeball about what the true situation was.\\"   Ms. Lee, an entertainment lawyer, said the community board wanted to begin telling producers that contributions are \\"a tradition.\\" And board members say they can describe Mr. Cosby's donations and how makers of the television series \\"N.Y.P.D.
