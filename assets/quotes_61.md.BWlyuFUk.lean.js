Set mostly in a poor New York neighorhood where disenfranchised blacks and impoverished Irish immigrants vied for the lowest rungs on the economic ladder, the show also details the cutthroat competition between Juba and his neighborhood rival, John Diamond, a hotshot Irish stepdancer.

Not with Barbara Stanwyck's rafter-rattling portrayal of a homicidal housewife in \\"Crime of Passion,\\" yesterday's screen accompaniment to a new stage bill. Co-starring Sterling Hayden and Raymond Burr, this United Artists release is the most curiously misguided dramatic missile to hit town (and the Palace) in some time.Miss Stanwyck, of course, is a sterling trouper who can do about anything, and has. But never has she switched gears so abruptly during one performance as in this odd number, which has a becoming, trim look about it (producer Bob Goldstein) and shows signs of thoughtful directing (Gerd Oswald) and writing (Joe Eisinger).The first ten minutes, in fact, offer some wry fun for Miss Stanwyck and the audience. As a seasoned San Francisco tabloid reporter, she breezily commutes from a \\"lovelorn\\" column to a wonderfully authentic courthouse press room. She also meets, attracts and is married to a visiting detective, Mr. Hayden. So far, so good.With the honeymooners settled in Los Angeles, the picture rather joltingly gets down to cases, specifically Miss Stanwyck's sudden, frenzied and, finally, murderous ambition for her unaggressive spouse.The cause of it all? The extremely dull social life of one of the world's crackerjack police divisions, the downtown Los Angeles Detective Bureau. It is a tightly intra-mural world, as seen here, of cocktail sessions, with the men swapping tight-lipped shop talk and empty-headed wives gossiping. In this world, too, the bored, frustrated wife of a second-grade detective can insure an inspectorship for her husband by easily seducing the inspector. When he reneges, she shoots him.That is the shrill but smoothly-machined course of action in a picture with some interesting footnotes and at least one compelling character. And, fantastic or not, the background remains original.So is a goodly portion of the dialogue. Miss Stanwyck's exchanges with Mr. Burr, as the smitten inspector, are so convincing that a taxpayer may feel uneasy. And in a mighty ticklish role, Mr. Burr, as a man with a conscience, is excellent.Mr. Hayden does what he can as the dumbest detective-husband on record. Fay Wray (welcome back!), Virginia Grey, and Royal Dano are quite good in fairly thankless roles.As for Miss Stanwyck's transition from the nice, sassy gal in the press room to a maniacal stalker, we don't believe it. Come off it, Miss Stanwyck. Once a reporter, always a lady.

That would scarcely befit gentlemen. But a certain vexation and impatience were clearly perceptible.There was a good bit of restless foot-scuffling, and those fellows down in the front row (at the first performance in the morning) let out some suspiciously hollow guffaws. No wonder, \\"The Bride Is Much Too Beautiful\\" is surprisingly circumspect with Mlle. Bardot.Let the story be trite and inconclusive. That is an artistic flaw that can be (and has been) tolerated by the admirers of Mlle. Bardot. They have borne with her through all sorts of far-fetched and senseless banalities, so one more lapse into the childish is not likely to discourage them.And this one is trite and inconclusive. In it, Mlle. Bardot spends an hour (after proper introductions) trying to capture the man she loves. She is a photographer's model and he is her bland employer, an elegant magazine editor who can't see beyond the end of his nose.Not even when he poses with her for a series of photographs representing a fancy wedding does he sense what is giving her the flutters. And it is only when she runs through the woods in a sheer negligee that the light dawns and he smartly takes out after her.That's the gist of what happens. Enough said. And, believe us, that chase in the woods and the scenes that immediately precede it are about the only ones in the picture that appropriately employ the conspicuous talents of Mlle. Bardot. (The preceding scenes have the lady, in the diaphanous negligée, searching farcically—and vainly—for someone to be kind to her.)Can you wonder those fellows in the front row were letting out hollow guffaws?Caught in this patent triviality with the petulant Mlle. Bardot are Louis Jourdan as the obtuse employer, Micheline Presle as his hopeful lady friend and Jean-François Calve as a model (opposite gender) who swoons hopelessly for Mlle. Bardot.Fred Surin was the director of this obviously incomplete film, which may have been trimmed in transit. The English subtitles are rather stingy, too. Screen: Brigitte Bardot","excerpt":"Stars in 'The Bride Is Much Too Beautiful'"},{"year":"1957","title":"THERE is certainly nothing subtle about \\"The Miller's Beautiful Wife,\\" an Italian comedy in costume, color and CinemaScope, which came yesterday to the Normandie. The story is studiously limited to making one obvious point, which is that man's elemental urges are easily disturbed by a lovely dame. And the fact that Sophia Loren is amply qualified to play the title role is not concealed from the public. It is generously revealed throughout the film.This is not said in criticism. Miss Loren is a monument to her sex, and the mere opportunity to observe her is a privilege not to be dismissed.As the buxom wife of a handsome miller in the area of Naples in the seventeenth century, Miss Loren arouses the fancy of the Spanish governor, who makes a valiant effort to seduce her—and that is the sum of the show. The governor goes slightly daffy, he causes the miller to be jailed. But the wife is dutiful and — well, that's the way it goes.It would be nice to be able to say the humor of this show matches its principal adornment, but that—too bad—is not so. The screen play by a quartet of writers is a hodge-podge of heavy-handed farce, in which Vittorio De Sica as the governor has to bear the most burdensome load. For an actor of his distinguished talents to have to have his face plastered with flour or to toss himself, dressed in wig and costume, into a country pond is something close to an outrage and a measure of the poverty of this film. Miss Loren also has to go through precisely the same routines.Others are equally offended. Yvonne Sanson as the governor's wife—a lady as buxom as Miss Loren — is stupidly abused, and Marcello Mastroianni as the miller has to play a fool. And Paolo Stoppa, a comedian of extraordinary skill, is reduced to acting a poor clown in an unbecoming costume.Mario Camerini's broad direction and all the money in the world cannot save this fatuous buffoonery. All it has is Miss Loren's ample charms.

Using an instrument of the composer's time, these quirky works, mixing lyricism, sudden exclamations, thrusting rhythms and languid meditation, would be cleansed of their pianistic mannerisms, stripped of their lush pedalings and revealed anew. And there is, in fact, much to be discovered in \\"authentic\\" renderings of these works (I have been admiring, for example, how a Dutch pianist, Trudelies Leonhardt, has disclosed their almost Baroque affects in her performances on an early-19th-century instrument, recorded on the Jecklin label).   But after hearing the first recital in this series by Seth Carlin at Merkin Concert Hall on Wednesday night, I am not sure why he undertook this project. Mr. Carlin is accomplished enough as a technician (though he tends to tighten up after a few pages of strenuous patter). He is sensitive enough in using the instrument to shape vocal lines. He even has a genteel respect for the material. Moreover, Mr. Carlin, who is a professor of music at Washington University in St. Louis, has a background that would raise expectations: degrees from Harvard and Juilliard, lessons with Rosina Lhevinne and Wilhelm Kempff, assorted prizes and grants.

That's why, perhaps more than any other American city, New York has been a beacon to writers and a ready-made backdrop for novels. So much so that it's entirely possible to plan a vacation based solely around literary New York -- to eat at the same restaurants, stay in the same hotels, explore the same city as a beloved fictional character. (Try that in, say, Tulsa.) This journey may reveal a fresh glimpse of a city that is, tantalizingly, never fully knowable. As the novelist Paul Auster writes in ''The New York Trilogy:'' ''New York was an inexhaustible space, a labyrinth of endless steps, and no matter how far he walked, no matter how well he came to know its neighborhoods and streets, it always left him with the feeling of being lost.'' Here, Mr. Auster is setting down the thoughts of his protagonist, Quinn, a mystery writer. But both men know that New York is a place worth getting lost in any time of the year.    WHERE TO STAY -- New York is an expensive town. But let's say you're traveling on a budget, or you're cheap, and you'd like a literary justification for booking into a hotel where Continental breakfast means walking to the corner deli. Try the Y.M.C.A. That's where P. B. Jones stays. He's the narrator of ''Answered Prayers,'' Truman Capote's dishy, thinly fictionalized tale about Manhattan's well heeled.

Track and field, then, provided us with probably the earliest and most enduring example of the sports metaphor, but almost every sport has made contributions.

It is being regenerated -- not in corners and in isolation, but in open and abundant communities, as documented by the photographer Edward Serotta. OUT OF THE SHADOWS: A Photographic Portrait of Jewish Life in Central Europe Since the Holocaust (Birch Lane/Carol, $49.95) documents Jewish communities in Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia and Germany. The photographs are surprising, poignant and convincing, depicting secular activists and religious adherents, rock concerts and reopened synagogues, professors, travel agents, rabbis and, always, children. The layering of past with present -- captured in a photograph of the old Jewish cemetery in Prague, where headstones are crowded eight centuries deep -- drives the book. Mr. Serotta intensifies those layers by highlighting his prints with strong whites and vivid blacks, as if time itself were being depicted. Ancient heralds warned of the damnation that accompanies joy. \\"But,\\" the Book of Psalms holds, \\"joy comes with the morning.\\" These communities are waking to the morning. IN SHORT: NONFICTION","excerpt":"Starting Over"},{"year":"1996","title":"Before he married Eva Wasierski, Tom Riley's life was \\"so uneventful, so without particulars, it might have been ordered from a catalogue.\\" An energetic  and opinionated world traveler, Eva prodded and enlivened this quiet pet-shop owner who had rarely ventured outside his native Chicago. They had planned to go to Egypt to celebrate their 10th wedding anniversary -- but instead Tom finds himself alone, mourning Eva's death in Lago de Luz, the small Mexican town where they spent their honeymoon. \\"You can't run from sorrow,\\" his sister warns  him. To which, with admirable logic, he replies, \\"I can cry in some warmer place, at least.\\" As the opening chapters of Sandra Scofield's latest novel, A CHANCE TO SEE EGYPT (HarperCollins, $22), make plain, Tom's journey is a metaphor: without Eva, he thinks he cannot cover new ground. But when, shortly into his stay, an incident at the hotel leads him to take up residence elsewhere, we understand that Tom is ready to venture beyond his past. Drawn to  the strength of a local woman, he slowly awakens to his love for her beautiful and spirited 18-year-old daughter, aptly named Divina. Ambushed by his emotions, Tom is aware that \\"he had not so much earned his joy as accepted it.\\" While this May-December romance may seem terribly familiar, Ms. Scofield (whose novel \\"Beyond Deserving\\" was a finalist for the National Book Award) gives it her own  skillful twist. With its lively cast of characters and its vividly rendered setting, \\"A Chance to See Egypt\\" emerges as an absorbing story that allows us to delight in Tom Riley's elation at the unexpected gift of a life renewed.

Last year, the going rate for the most sought after law graduates was $43,000, up from $37,000 the year before. Summer interns who had completed the first two years of law school earned $850 to $900 a week.   Although salaries will go up again this year, probably to somewhere around $47,000, the whole concept of the going rate seems to be on its way out.

In both cases, there is an irresistible temptation to look too closely at the details, to demand both subtlety and grand effect, and to instantly put the experience into the context of the broader canon. Usually, though, a work cannot really be seen until one steps back, stops worrying about the brush strokes and  sees it with the perspective that distance affords. With a painting, one can have it both ways instantly, but in music perspective is a matter of time rather than space.         Philip Glass benefits from this distance more than many composers. Even for listeners who are sympathetic to his style, with its repetitive chord figures, scale runs and arpeggiated bass lines, his works can be numbing on first hearing. And \\"The Voyage,\\" which he composed for the Metropolitan Opera, sounded ponderous and diffuse when it had its premiere in 1992.
