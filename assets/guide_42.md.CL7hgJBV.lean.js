Mr. Jarecki took film of a continuing tragedy and shrewdly wove the footage into a grim, watchable wormhole narrative about a family's decades-long tumble into a shattering pile of self-denial, lies and abuse. In the case of the Friedman family of Great Neck, on Long Island, the videotapes and eight-millimeter films say plenty. The amiable, deep bond between father and sons is tested when a child pornography scandal rocks their homes and lives. Mr. Jarceki so recognizes the archetypal figures in the Friedman home that he knows to push things any further through heavy-handed assessment would be redundant. This translates into an astonishing amount of confidence in his judgment.
