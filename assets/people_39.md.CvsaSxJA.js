Perhaps as a sign of the so-called stressful economic times, though, the maximum cost of violating the rule has been slashed in half, from $500,000 to $250,000.   The rule is aimed at keeping owners quiet publicly during negotiations with the players for a new collective bargaining agreement. The negotiators don't want their efforts undermined by individual owners' making comments that conflict with the official bargaining position.   When it was first imposed in 1979, some owners labeled the rule the ''Grebey discipline code,'' after Ray Grebey, who was then the owners' chief negotiator. This time the rule has been instituted by Commissioner Peter Ueberroth.

That's what the title character has to face in Griffin Dunne's hilarious mock documentary LISA PICARD IS FAMOUS (2000). Just as Lisa (Laura Kirk) has won a small part in a Melissa Gilbert television movie, her pal Tate (Nat DeWolf) stages his dreadful one-man show about homophobia and it's a hit. Mr. Dunne plays the filmmaker documenting the adventures of Lisa, who proves to be highly self-absorbed.

The German original, known as \\"Melodie des Herzens,\\" is being shown simultaneously at the Eighth Street Playhouse. The Berlin film-makers cannot point with any degree of pride to this effort, for aside from poor direction, inadequate vocal recording, childish dialogue, the story itself leaves one mystified as to why it was ever thought deserving of spending money on it to bring it to the screen.While there is little to choose between the two editions of this production, the one in German at least has its deliberate dialogue spoken by native actors. The English copy, with the same players, has but one or two lines that are not uttered with a decided foreign accent. How the recording of the voices in this production has been accomplished is of small consequence, for it might have been preferable to have had still further haphazard synchronization than to have the lines spoken as they are, with ludicrous hesitation as well as a German accent.This inept story tells of Julia Balog (Dita Parlo), a Hungarian servant girl, who falls in love with a soldier named Janos Garas (Willy Fritsch), the son of moderately well-to-do country folk. Julia is discharged by her mistress for staying out too late with Janos on the eve of his leaving with his regiment for military maneouvres. The girl later frets over a bill she owes to a landlady, and the woman, after demanding payment, dilates upon the money Julia could make if she joined the feminine throng at the notorious Paradise Café. Julia is impelled to take up the sordid existence, so as to put by a comfortable sum that she believes will help her and Janos to marry so soon as Janos is discharged from the army.Soon after Janos's return, however, he sees the once simple Julia, with painted lips and touched-up eyebrows, in the Paradise Café, and there ensues a futile attempt at a quasi satisfactory ending.All this is set forth without a whit of imagination. There are long periods when no lines are spoken and none of the characters has a chance to be lonely, for no matter where they go they seem to be followed by an orchestra.There have been many silly American productions, but none that falls as low as this. Hanns Schwartz is credited with the direction. He has only succeeded in causing Herr Fritsch and Fräulein Parlo, two ordinarily competent players, to give performances that make them look like amateurs.

Yeltsin ended an impasse with parliamentary opposition by shelling the building in which they organized a sit-in. Russia lasted 25 months from coup to crisis","excerpt":"Ukraine lasted 20 months from revolution to crisis. The paper says the outcome will be similar in the two countries. It will destroy all the symbols and romantic illusions built up by voters. Kommersant concludes that while many feared Ukraine was leaving Russia forever, they must now be glad because now their Slavic neighbors are walking the same path Russia took from its own 1993 crisis.    KURIL ISLANDS BECOME WEALTHY: The Russian Government is to approve a program Thursday whereby more money will be invested into the Kuril Islands than in any other region of Russia. The program will spend about $1,000 per month per resident from 2007 to 2015 to make the islands a more attractive place to live for Russian citizens. The territory seized by the Soviet Union at the end of the Second World War is also claimed by Japan.    VEDOMOSTI    BEST ALUMINUM IN THE WORLD: Oleg Deripaskas Rusal won the title for the most profitable aluminum corporation in the world,with a 2005 profit of $1.65 billion. Rusal is the worlds third largest aluminum corporation. It closest competitor in profitability is Chinas Chalco.    IZVESTIA    LENIN BUSTS FASHIONABLE AMONG GARDENERS: Volgograd retiree Viktor Simonyants found a bust of Vladimir Ilyich Lenin in the basement of his old automotive shop. It was thrown down there after it became necessary to do so. He rescued and restored the bust, and it now sits proudly in his garden outside the city. The Ilyich works, as images of Lenin are often called, are being collected along with sculptures and pictures of other Soviet leaders by many of Russias retiree-gardeners. Mr. Simonyets says his view of Lenin has not changed and hopes over time the founders historical role will be given objective consideration.    GOVERNMENT TO ATTRACT WORLD-CLASS RESORTS: The Ministry of Economic Development and Trade announced a competitive contract to build world-class resorts in Russia. The programs special economic zones will create attractive conditions for prospective developers in Russias picturesque but as yet harsh areas. Officials expect around 40 applications from regional governments vying for the zoning contracts, but only five will be chosen. Among those likely to win contracts are areas around Lake Baikal, the Black Sea, and mountainous skiing areas.    GAZETA    THE WEAKER SEX EMERGES IN UNITED RUSSIA PARTY LIST: Every fourth United Russia candidate for the October 8 regional parliamentary elections is a woman, said Vyachezlav Volodin, a party leader. The majority of the candidates on the newly-completed party list have been selected from among Russias regional intelligentsia; very few businessmen or bureaucrats made the cut. Instead of ideology the party will focus on concrete deeds, like increasing agricultural output, building roads and improving schools.    MINISTRY PROPOSES NEW BANKRUPTCY LAWS: In response to a boom in consumer lending, the Ministry of Economic Development and Trade has prepared amendments to the nonfunctional law on bankruptcy that will make lending safer for banks and cheaper for borrowers. According to Valery Kurgashov, vice-president of Promsvyzbank, if the law helps banks to recover assets from loan recipients, these losses do not have to be included in the cost of obtaining credit. There is one loophole, however: if money is lent on the basis of false documents, bankruptcy claims will not be successful.    VREMYA NOVOSTEI    LAST AL QAEDA MILITANT IN RUSSIA NAMED: The Chechen prosecutors office announced on Wednesday charges against a 45-year-old Jordanian, Abu Khavs, an Al Qaeda leader in Russia. In mid-July prosecutors opened an international investigation into his activities, accusing him of taking part in the June 12, 2004, assault on the village of Avtura. Prosecutors expect to add more charges in the near future. Abu Khavs has been active in Chechnya since 1994, when he arrived with Al Qaeda militants from fighting in Tajikistan.    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA    ANTI-NUCLEAR CAMP CONCLUDES IN TOMSK: Activists from an international environmental organization, Eco-protection, and the Tomsk Student Ecological Inspectorate capped off their seventh-annual anti-nuclear camp on Wednesday with an unsanctioned protest against the import of depleted uranium into Russia. Twelve activists were arrested. Also on Wednesday, the campers met with representatives from the Siberian Chemical Plant, who claimed that there is no radioactive waste on the premises. Officials do not consider depleted uranium to be waste, however.

Currently, there is a ceramic-sculpture renaissance in America, and artists are stretching the historically demure limitations of clay - pots, bowls and figurines - to make full-fledged figures colored with all matter of gaudy glaze or, radically, with no glaze at all.  It is obvious that, during the heady era of Art Deco, Gregory had already explored these possibilities, borrowing idiosyncratically from primitive and sophisticated European sources, such as Brancusi, and American social-realism, which celebrated idealized broad-shouldered bodies.

Ambassador Albright immediately denounced Nigeria, whose delegate was at the meeting, and she proposed that the Security Council consider punitive action. Five weeks later the U.N.

The story of what happened in between is a revealing tale of why it's so difficult today to get the U.N. to stand against even the most outrageous human rights abuses.         During the cold war it was always hard to get the Security Council to take up human rights cases because the Soviet Union would veto any condemnation of itself or its allies.

A1    Bombs Kill 10 in Iran  Seven bomb blasts shattered Iran's pre-election calm, leaving at least 10 people dead and nearly 80 wounded in one of the worst outbreaks of political violence in the country since the end of the Iran-Iraq war in 1988.   A1    Hundreds of women staged a pre-election demonstration in Tehran, protesting sex discrimination under Iran's Islamic leadership.   A8    Iraqi Army a Limited Success  Americans training the new Iraqi Army believe it could be several years before the Iraqi forces will be ready to stand alone against the insurgents.

Wilson, a former Central Intelligence Agency officer freed from prison after serving 22 years in connection with the sale of arms and explosives to Libya in the 1970's, hopes to clear his name.

Sweeney, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., are planning to announce that they are forming a coalition aimed at unionizing large numbers of workers. Labor leaders said they were planning this move because they want to form an aggressively pro-growth coalition and because they believe the federation is doing too little to organize nonunion workers.

This time around city officials appear to be taking a more conciliatory approach. They are reaching out more to the businesses, known as sex clubs, and seeking their cooperation in monitoring themselves rather than forcing further closings. They say the clubs, which offer patrons anonymous sex with multiple partners, can actually help reduce the spread of the virus if their patrons can be steered to practice safer sex. Emphasis on Monitoring    The resurgence of commercial sex establishments, catering to both homosexuals and heterosexuals, in New York and other cities is at odds with signs that many people are growing more conservative in their sexual practices because they fear AIDS. Public health officials in New York City say several factors may be at play -- denial of the H.I.V. risk, a sense of immortality among younger generations, sexual preferences that are difficult to modify, and even a sense of fatalism.

Directed by Richard Pearce, the film (review on page C20) lends an uncharacteristically home-grown flavor to the premiere of a festival that has long been more associated with foreign films than American.     This year, 9 of the festival's 26 movies are American, and 6 are American independent films - more than have ever been included. Moreover, this year's closing film provides a certain kind of symmetry. ''Paris, Texas'' was written by Mr. Shepard, the Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright, from a short sketch about a man whose wife deserts him","excerpt":"unable to face raising their son alone, he deposits the child with his brother and sister-in- law and disappears.
