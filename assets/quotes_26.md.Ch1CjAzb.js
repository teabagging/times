San Juan was founded by Juan Ponce de Leon in the early 1500's, before he discovered Florida and more than 100 years before the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth, Mass. The city has the Western Hemisphere's oldest executive mansion (La Fortaleza), and church (San Jose). The institute oversees all aspects of historical restoration and among the results are gracious homes with interior patios, sweeping arches and carved wood balconies. Most gift shops, art galleries and restaurants are in restored buildings, as are the many small museums operated by the institute. A tour of the old city should include visits to the massive stone ramparts of El Morro and Fort San Cristobal, from which attacks by Sir Francis Drake and other marauders were repulsed.

Export prices fell 0.1 percent, compared with forecasts for a 0.2 percent increase and a 0.1 percent rise in July. Excluding petroleum, import prices were flat last month compared with a 0.2 percent decline in July and have shown no increase since rising 0.4 percent in April, the Labor Department said. Over the last 12 months, import prices have risen 7.6 percent, reflecting a 42.5 percent rise in the cost of petroleum. Stripping out petroleum, import prices are up 1.8 percent over the last 12 months. (Reuters)    Japanese Software Developer to Acquire PalmSource  The Access Company, the Japanese software developer, said yesterday that it would buy the handheld computer software maker PalmSource Inc. for about $324 million in cash, in a deal that strengthens the company's roster of products for mobile phones. Access said that it would offer $18.50 a share, an 83 percent premium to Thursday's Nasdaq closing price of PalmSource, the maker of the popular Palm operating system. Shares of PalmSource soared 78 percent yesterday, climbing to very near the offering price. Palm OS is PalmSource's operating system software, which controls tens of millions of handheld personal digital organizers and so-called smartphones. (Reuters)    Fiat and Ford to Develop Two Small Cars  Fiat Auto has found a new partner in Detroit seven months after breaking off a broad alliance with General Motors. Fiat announced an agreement yesterday with Ford Motor that envisages the two working together on new models of their small cars. Fiat and Ford both said they signed a memorandum of understanding to develop two small cars: a revival of Fiat's Cinquecento and a new version of the Ford Ka. (AP)    New Chicken Sandwich Bolsters McDonald's Sales  Sales at McDonald's restaurants rose 3.4 percent in August on strong demand for a new line of higher-priced chicken sandwiches, the company said yesterday. Sales at United States restaurants open at least 13 months were up 3.2 percent for the month and were at the low end of Wall Street expectations for a rise of 3 to 6 percent. Still, Andrew Barish, a Banc of America Securities analyst, said the results were impressive, given a strong United States performance last year. Same-store sales in Europe, where McDonald's has been working to revitalize its business, climbed 3.6 percent. Strong sales in France and Germany helped offset weakness in Britain, McDonald's said. (Reuters)         Biovail Wins F.D.A. Approval for Painkiller Variation  Shares of the Biovail Corporation jumped yesterday after the company said it had received final approval from the Food and Drug Administration for a once-daily form of the painkiller Tramadol. Shares of Biovail rose $4.31, or nearly 24 percent, to $22.58. Biovail, a Canadian drug company, plans to introduce the drug early next year. (Dow Jones/AP)    Cargill to Buy Food Ingredients Unit of Degussa  Degussa, the German chemicals company, said yesterday that it would sell its food ingredients unit to Cargill  for 540 million euros ($670.6 million), to focus on its core business. The unit, which makes colorings and sweeteners for candy, beverages and other foods, employs 2,100 and had 2004 sales of 441 million euros. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. (AP)    Marsh Names a Chief for Risk and Insurance Unit  The Marsh & McLennan Companies said yesterday that Brian M. Storms, left, who had headed its Mercer consulting unit, will take over as chairman and chief executive of its Marsh Inc. risk and insurance subsidiary. The top posts at Marsh Inc. had been held by Michael G. Cherkasky, who became president and chief executive of Marsh & McLennan last October after the resignation of Jeffrey W. Greenberg amid a bid-rigging and price-fixing scandal. ''With Marsh making progress in its recovery, it is time for me to dedicate my full attention to refining and implementing M.M.C.'s overall growth strategy and to creating value for M.M.C.'s clients and shareholders,'' Mr. Cherkasky said in a statement. Last January, Marsh & McLennan, the insurance brokerage firm, agreed to pay $850 million in restitution to end an investigation by the New York attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, into bid rigging and price fixing. (AP)    Judge Dismisses S.E.C. Complaint in Halliburton Case  A judge has dismissed a complaint accusing the former chief financial officer of Halliburton of aiding and abetting the company in filing financial reports that did not promptly disclose a 1998 change in accounting procedures. Federal District Judge Lee Rosenthal ruled the Securities and Exchange Commission complaint did not show that Gary V. Morris knew of any wrongdoing. Mr. Morris still faces a charge accusing him of negligence for allowing statements to be released without the full accounting disclosure. (AP)    Volkswagen Names Leader for North America  Volkswagen appointed the sales and marketing chief of its Bentley brand to take over as head of its struggling Volkswagen of America unit on Oct. 1. Adrian Michael Hallmark, 43, will assume responsibility for VW's United States and Canada business from Len Hunt, who will succeed him as head of sales and marketing for Bentley. The move comes as Volkswagen struggles to come back from a decline in sales in the United States.

For nearly two centuries, New York City has been the financial capital of the nation and one of the pillars of the world's financial system. And despite the current gloomy atmos phere -- punctuated by huge layoffs at brokerage houses, declining business and the collapse of several firms -- many people say New York's securities industry is not threatened.    Still, Wall Street may never quite return to the manic 1980's, when it helped propel the city's and the nation's economies.    \\"I see an industry that has grown almost exponentially for the last decade and accumuluated a head count that cannot be sustained,\\" said Samuel L. Hayes 3d, a finance professor at the Harvard Business School. \\"But to be at the cutting edge of investment banking, it means being on the cutting edge of market intelligence, and that's not easy from Dubuque.\\"   The turning point for Wall Street came with the stock market crash of Oct. 19, 1987. Since then, employment has fallen by about 27,000 people, to 137,000, and it continues to plummet. Large firms like E. F. Hutton & Company and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. are now history. And other major firms like Morgan Stanley & Company have talked about moving to the suburbs.   Professor Hayes doubts that any leading firm will leave the city -- largely because most high-profit lines of business depend on the personal interaction of skilled financiers.  'A Lot of Consolidation'    But \\"it will be different,\\" said Lowell L. Bryan, a director at McKinsey & Company, adding: \\"Wall Street will never have as many highly paid people as in the past decade. We will see a lot of consolidation. Technology will continue to replace people.\\"    Wall Street has taken hits besides the '87 crash. Many of its businesses, like money market funds, have turned into high-volume, low-margin ventures, and deregulation has brought in tough competition from commercial banks.    Fortunately, opportunities have emerged from foreign demand for access to American markets and from the growing market for financial ventures that cross international borders. \\"Wall Street would be a lot smaller if it were not for globalization,\\" said Robert S. Salomon Jr., a managing director at Salomon Brothers.    But over all, Wall Street seems to be looking toward a quieter future. \\"The 1980's was a period of excess that is unlikely to be repeated,\\" said Michael Goldstein, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company.

As a result, some managers have shortened the average maturity of their holdings, while others plan to do so in coming weeks and some have sold off holdings and have moved into short-term instruments like Treasury bills and commercial paper.    These investors are troubled by the recent indications that the economy is stronger than previously thought. They think that the strong economy, coupled with continued credit demands, will heat up inflation and cause interest rates to rise. ''We think the bond rally is about over with,'' said William H.

Miss Boland is a widely accomplished performer, even though her screen apprenticeship thus far has been served in slapstick rôles. But the obscurely assembled emotional hodge-podge into which she now has been thrust would have put a burden on the virtuose Marie Dressler herself.We mention the late Miss Dressler because it was with an eye to developing a successor to that beloved actress that Paramount cast Miss Boland in \\"A Son Comes Home.\\" In a setting very like a lot of those associated with Marie Dressler, Miss Boland appears as the storm-tossed proprietress of Mary Grady's Chowder House on the San Francisco fishermen's wharf, expressing herself with the same gold-filled gruffness that characterized Miss Dressler's rôles in \\"Anna Christie\\" and the Tugboat Annie series. You get the notion, however, that Miss Boland would have liked to be herself in this film had not set designers, script writers and directors decreed otherwise.The Widow Grady has lived for the last fifteen years in the hope that her runaway son, Denny, would return. This hope, recounted in a newspaper story, inspires a young hitchhiker, wrongly accused of a murder he tried to prevent, to identify himself as the missing Denny. The widow, believing in his innocence if not his identity, act knowledges him and goes to his defense with all the resources at her command. A glance at a picture of the late Mr. Grady convinces the accused young man that the murder he saw was committed by the missing Denny Grady.Despite his consequent efforts to prevent a search for the real murderer, the widow and her newspaper acquaintance, Steve, hunt down the killer, who is dispatched by police bullets immediately after a brief and unpleasant reunion with his mother.Good supporting performances are given by Julie Haydon as the widow's adopted daughter","excerpt":"Wallace Ford, Herbert Rawlinson and Roger Imhof, who plays a detective rôle in a new and pleasing departure from the Hollywood norm.

Wallace, a highly regarded player from Rochester, was on a recruiting trip to the school and taking in the sights. At that moment, there occurred a sight he'd never forget.         Marshall Street is just off the main campus and, lined with bars and fast-food restaurants, is a popular place for students.

Both of them were run off for me at a special showing in one of the projection room of the Ufa at Neubabelsberg. I believe I am the first American journalist to be able to report or them.They show that the Ufa is unquestionably on the right track. Both of them have qualities which will appeal to British and American audiences. There is a distinctly Continental atmosphere about them, that something \\"different\\" which we are always searching for. I should think they would make an excellent change of pace for our metropolitan audiences, who must sometimes get just a little tired of the products of Hollywood, which, for all their smoothness and general competency, have a tendency to be of a sameness. And they will, of course, reach much larger circles than the German language talkers, which require for their enjoyment either a knowledge of the Teuton tongue or considerable good-will and imagination.An English Actress.I have already reported on \\"Monte Carlo Madness\\" when it had its successful Berlin premiere at the Ufa Palast in the German language. The English version has some very distinct advantages. The little English girl who plays the feminine lead is a much better type for the part than Anna Sten, who played it in German. You may perhaps recall that the rôle demanded a queen of a Balkan State who impersonated a cocotte. With Fräulein Sten you believed in the cocotte but not in the queen—which gave the story a kink. The charming English girl who played it had real naiveté and breeding and you had no trouble in accepting her royal origin.And then the English version is much more skillfully cut. The action of the German was often held up unmercifully by dragging musical and scenic sequences from which the director evidently could not bear to part because of their lyric or pictorial beauty. The English film has been mercilessly cleared for action, running a half an hour shorter than its Teuton twin.The mixture of accents is, of course, a disadvantage. Not every foreigner's accent is as charming as that of Chevalier. Here Hans Albers, the star, is not yet quite sure of himself in our tongue. Sometimes I even had difficulty in catching every word. But this player, on whom I always use up my supply of superlatives, gets over enough of his exuberant personality to do considerable damage to the emotions of the American weaker sex. And when he has our language under complete control he will go up on the wall beside Gary Cooper and Victor McLaglen.A Spectacular Work.I shall not now report at length on \\"The Congress Dances,\\" for it has its German premiere at the end of this week and I will write in detail about it then. But I may say that it seems to me that the English version has as good a chance in America as the German in the Fatherland. It is a big, spectacular film in which the high moments are scenic presentations of the historical Vienna of 1815. These are, of course, equally effective in both versions. And Lilian Harvey, the graceful, lighthearted little star, was born in England and is even easier in Anglo-Saxon. Conrad Veidt speaks a trifle carefully and precisely, but every word is understandable, and this deliberateness is not ill suited to the diplomatic deliberateness of the statesman Metternich, whom he is interpreting. The Czar was played by the Frenchman Jean Garat, who also acted the rôle in the French version. He may not be a Chevalier but his French esprit trickles through. The rest of the players were imported from England and speak the English tongue as they do in the British isle. As the theme is historical and the players all in costume, I see no reason why any one should take any objection to this. We are used to the accents of Oxford in classical pieces. If the players' voices suggested Carolina or California, would this be any better suited to old Vienna?The latest German language film contributions were not very exciting. Only one, \\"Berlin-Alexanderplatz,\\" at the Capitol, stood out as anything exceptional. And this was a disappointment to those who had been excitedly awaiting this film ever since it was announced six months ago. For the novel of the same name, from which it was taken, is one of the most powerful books written in Germany within the last decade. In it the author, Alfred Döblin, using a technique which slightly suggests that of Joyce's \\"Ulysses,\\" gives a picture of modern Berlin which is extraordinary in its fullness and virility. It is as though we drew Berlin in through our pores, became one with the superficial glitter of Kurfürstendamm and the bitter, brutal joviality of Alexanderplatz. I know of no word painting of a big city which can be compared to it. And the leading figure, Franz Biberkopf, is an exceptional piece of human portraiture. The author has succeeded in the difficult feat of making us understand and even sympathize with an uneducated man of the commonest origin, whose actions are often coarse and brutal.Of course, it was not to be expected that the film could give an exact reproduction of the novel, for this was an especially fat volume which depended for many of its effects on a detailed enumeration of minor facts and happenings. But I had hoped that it would be possible to catch the atmosphere of the book and to give us the outline of its leading figure. Especially as much of the novel was written in a technique that seemed to shout for the cool, recording eye of the camera. But although the author himself was partially responsible for the scenario, there was hardly a moment which gave us the feeling of the book and we never got inside the personality of Biberkopf.Far From the Book.Also the young director, Phil Jutzi, was leagues off from the quality of the book—under his hands it came out as merely another crook melodrama. Even Heinrich George, one of Germany's finest screen players, did little with the rôle of Biberkopf for which he was so admirably suited. This is another example of the fact that the best player can accomplish nothing on the screen unless he has the support of a director who at least knows what he is about technically.But perhaps the real lesson of \\"Berlin-Alexanderplatz\\" is that \\"literature\\" has as little place in the talker as it had on the silent screen.The American films of the week, although they were both shown with the original American dialogue, aroused considerably more interest. In the first place there was the long awaited \\"Morocco\\" with Marlene Dietrich. Fräulein Dietrich has not been seen here since \\"The Blue Angel\\" and the fantastic reports about her American successes have kept the interest in her simmering. I do not need to tell you the German critics' objection to the picture—they were much the same as the ones made in America. They found the first half with its creation of African atmosphere as good as anything that Sternberg has done. But they could not swallow the banality and sentimentality of the last part. When Marlene takes off her shoes and follows the soldier out into the desert in stocking feet, the audience snickered. So after the first performance the film stopped with her merely gazing after him—thus taking away the whole point of the elaborate preparations which lead up to the original ending. No, despite the appeal of the performances of Fräulein Dietrich and Gary Cooper, this film will not repeat its American success in Germany.And at the intimate Kamera Jackie Coogan made his first grown-up bow to German audiences in \\"Tom Sawyer.\\" The press was unanimous in its praise. There are evidently still a great many people who have not forgotten their first love for Jackie. But, of course, the American dialogue is a great handicap, as it must be understood to get the full quality of the picture. I do not imagine it will be shown outside Berlin and here only for about a week.Roxy's Idea.ROXY has been with us. With a blare of the best brass trumpets he entered the city walls and the mighty of the German film and radio bowed down to him.

He also stated that he believed that there was a big field in America for German language pictures if their action was so clear as to be understandable without requiring a knowledge of the Teutonic tongue.
