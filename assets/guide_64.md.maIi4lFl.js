''The ticket can still be used for a year, it's just that the actual change has to be made within 90 days,'' said Kurt Ebenhoch, a Northwest spokesman. The new policy, which he said was adopted for better inventory control, applies to all tickets issued on or after April 15. Terry Trippler, the chief executive of Farefacts.com, a travel adviser based in Minneapolis, said, ''It's a big change.'' As of yesterday, he said, no other airline had followed Northwest's lead. Typically, major airlines allow passengers who cancel an original flight on a nonrefundable ticket to rebook the ticket anytime within a year for a $100 change fee. Over the last five years, business travelers have been rebelling against high walk-up fares by switching to the nonrefundable tickets favored by tourists. Because business travelers change their plans so often, many corporate travel managers use procedures, like American Express's TicketTrax service, to keep track of unused tickets and flag them for rebooking.    EUROPE'S LURE -- Despite a weak dollar, trans-Atlantic air traffic grew in March for the 21st consecutive month, according to Donald N. Martin & Company, a travel marketing specialist based in New York. For all of 2004, travel to Europe (including the Russian Federation) originating in the United States rose to 12.1 million trips, an increase of 12.4 percent over 2003, the company said, citing data from the United States Commerce Department. In 2005, industry analysts say, the volume of travel by Americans to Europe is expected to match or surpass the record of 12.8 million trips in 2000. Economy-class trans-Atlantic fares are expected to remain at last summer's levels, even though domestic carriers have been adding trans-Atlantic capacity, said Hugo Burge, the president of Cheapflights.com, an online fare broker. Premium cabin seats, however, are being discounted, Mr. Burge said. Airlines are sharply cutting fares in business class on trans-Atlantic routes, too, he said.    HANGING UP -- The revenue that hotels derive from guest room telephones fell last year to an average of $2 a day per occupied room, compared with $4.10 in 2000, according to the Hospitality Research Group of PKF Consulting, which is based in San Francisco. The reasons are fairly obvious, said Robert Mandelbaum, the director of research information services: increased use of cellphones and calling cards as well as a reaction against surcharges on telephone calls. While hotel managers struggle to adapt to and even profit from new portable communications technologies, room phones and fax machines could go the way of the in-room fly swatter, Mr. Mandelbaum said.    CHEAPER BY THE MILE -- As competition over fares remained fierce, the revenue airlines squeezed out of travelers for each mile flown fell 6.7 percent on domestic routes in the first quarter for eight major airlines, the Air Transport Association said. Most international routes fared better. Yields rose 2.7 percent on Atlantic routes and 3.7 percent on Pacific routes, while falling 4.4 percent on Latin American routes for the eight airlines surveyed: Alaska","excerpt":"American, America West, Continental, Delta, Northwest, United and US Airways.

Claude Simon became the first French author to win the prize for literature since Jean-Paul Sartre was offered it in 1964. (Sartre declined on the grounds that his acceptance might be seen as influencing his future work.) The 72-year-old Mr. Simon, who has been little read in the United States and not much better read in his own country, helped to pioneer the ''new novel'' of the 1950's that moved away from the conventions of plot and character development. He is often grouped with such practitioners of the ''nouveau roman'' as Alain Robbe-Grillet and Nathalie Sarraute, and some of his fictional techniques are drawn from the work of William Faulkner, James Joyce and Marcel Proust. A spokesman for the Royal Swedish Academy said: ''It takes hard work to read Simon, and it requires a good memory. You have to read him several times.'' This year's prizewinners for medicine, Dr. Michael S. Brown and Dr. Joseph L. Goldstein, were honored for their 1973 discovery that human cells have receptors that trap and absorb particles that contain cholestrol. The Nobel committee credited them with increasing the possibilities of preventing and treating hardening of the arteries and heart attacks.
