The singing, including the deep tones from Noah Beery, is most pleasing and so far as the story is concerned, it is, after all, with all its implausible romanticism, no worse than the tales of most musical offerings. In fact, it is less exasperating, for, as in \\"The Rogue Song,\\" the songs come often and one can smile at the melodramatic action.This picture, an expensive affair with a host of persons in its cast, is an adaptation of the operetta by Otto Harbach, Oscar Hammerstein 2d, George Gershwin and Herbert Stothart. The film version was directed by Alan Crosland, who in this instance is not nearly as extravagant as is his usual wont. He has given his performers ample opportunity to unbosom themselves by song. Among the vocalists are Alexander Gray, who figures as Prince Volodya","excerpt":"Bernice Claire, a charming woman who impersonates The Flame, the Joan of Arc of Russia; Alice Gentle, who has the sinister rôle of Natasha, and Mr. Beery, who plays the villain, Konstantin.The settings are magnificent and the crowds have been exceptionally well handled by Mr. Crosland. It really doesn't matter whether the Bolsheviks have the upper hand or the Red leader is discovered to be a traitor to the cause so long as they give vent to their feelings in Gershwin's or Stothart's compositions.Perhaps those who are seeking dramatic interest in a picture may find fault with the idea of Konstantin going before the firing squad in a singing mood, especially when he renders in a voice suited to \\"Rocked in the Cradlel of the Deep,\\" a song known as, \\"One Little Drink.\\" The soldiers are permitted to hold up the execution until the ballad is nearly finished and then comes the report of firearms.Yet this is no more than has been done in several other musical screen offerings, only it has seldom been done as well, or with such charming voices. \\"The Cossack Love Song\\" is a lilting melody that cannot fail to appeal to the spectator and as for the \\"Song of the Flame,\\" one could listen to it for longer than this picture lasts without becoming bored. This offering may not have all the glamour of the original stage production but there's no gainsaying that the singing voices are splendidly recorded and as a picture it is far and away ahead of most of the persevering Warner Brothers' other musical comedy efforts. Also there is a good idea of sound perspective in this audible film, which is another point in its favor.Miss Claire is not the Hollywood type of beauty but she has a great deal of charm and her singing is most beguiling. She and the other vocalists, including Mr. Beery, Miss Gentle and Mr. Gray, won applause by their efforts last night and well they deserved it.The story, such as it is, runs from St. Petersburg to a small town where there is a fête. It happens at a time when The Flame is exhorting the populace to rebellion. As in most such narratives, the man who falls in love with this heroine is the Prince and the individual who would snare her away with the valuables he has pocketed for himself is the rascal Konstantin.Konstantin, however, as has been told, meets an inglorious end and the Prince becomes one of the masses to win the love of Aniuta, The Flame.There are several effective scenes, with fairly good technicolor shading which while it may be wide of anything lifelike, at least serves to bring out the hues of the uniforms and gowns.

But this variation on an ancient theme, made classic by Goethe, sadly lacks the impact of forceful acting inspired by great writing. And the offering, reportedly the first Yiddish movie drama to be made here since the war, has imprisoned its players in a few sets, thereby robbing the work of movement. As a stage presentation it is hardly in its proper medium.Jacob Gordin, who wrote the original play that justifiably impressed Yiddish playgoers of a generation ago, was, like Goethe, treating of indestructible truths. He is telling again the story of Hershalle, a copyist of Torahs and a pious and good man, who is beguiled by the Devil in human guise. Made rich by Satan, who also becomes his business partner and adviser, Hershalle not only forgets and ruins his friends but divorces his faithful wife and marries his niece. And it is only after he turns his aged father out of his house and unwittingly brings tragedy to his closest friend that he learns that mere pelf is not the key to happiness. In a final, tragic move he breaks the Devil's hold to leave his wealth and return to God.As the ill-fated Hershalle, Michal Michaesko is giving a literal and somewhat pallid performance. But such Yiddish stage stalwarts as Leon Schachter, who plays his friend, Max Bozyk, as the doddering father","excerpt":"Berta Gersten, as the discarded wife, and Shifra Lehrer, as her distraught successor, contribute a few poignant and humorous moments.

He felt he could no longer live in -- or believe in --  a country that tolerated violence and worshiped money. He kept homes in both Rome and London but, as an artist, he was eager to turn his back on Europe, preferring to set his next three films -- \\"The Last Emperor,\\" \\"The Sheltering Sky\\" and \\"Little Buddha\\" -- in Asia and North Africa.         Older, rounder and certainly more mellow, Mr. Bertolucci, now 55, returned home last summer to make \\"Stealing Beauty,\\" his first film shot in Italy in 15 years. He felt able to do so, he said, because recent Italian anti-corruption campaigns had changed things for the better. But he also worried that he had lost touch with Italy. So, rather than tackling an Italian subject head on, he chose to tell the story of a group of foreigners, including several expatriate Britons and a beautiful young American woman, who are spending a Henry Jamesian  summer in a hillside villa in Tuscany.    FILM","excerpt":"Bertolucci Proves You Can Go Home Again"},{"year":"1994","title":"DRESSED IN TRADITIONAL maroon robes, an old Tibetan lama who is visiting a Buddhist center in Seattle lifts his green cup filled with tea and suddenly smashes it down on a table. Mind and body are like the contents and the container, he calmly explains to an attentive but skeptical American. The cup is no longer a cup, but the tea is still tea, whether on the table, the floor or in the towel used to mop it up. The liquid moves from one container to another, just as the mind, after death, moves from one body to the next.\\n\\nThese teachings about reincarnation and other lessons on Tibetan Buddhism are presented in Bernardo Bertolucci's latest film, \\"Little Buddha,\\" which opens Friday. Shot on location in Nepal, Bhutan and Seattle, the movie is an ambitious tale of East and West, the blending of an historical epic with a modern-day parable of spiritual awakening. The ancient story of Siddhartha, the prince of the Sakya clan whose own search culminated in his attaining Buddhahood, or enlightenment, is interwoven with the contemporary tale of a blond American boy named Jesse Conrad (Alex Wiesendanger), who is believed by Tibetan monks to be the reincarnation of an important lama.
