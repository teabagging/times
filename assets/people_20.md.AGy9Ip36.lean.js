(Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $24.)

THE CROSSLEY BABY, by Jacqueline Carey. (Ballantine, $23.95.) A foamy, delightful novel that concerns distinctly sober subjects, like fidelity, responsibility and greed, all evoked in strife between two sisters (one a collector of boyfriends, the other a hard-line businesswoman) over the orphaned baby of a third.

But chess was a final digital frontier, a programmer's Mount Everest. And while it is not clear that Deep Blue's victory will give I.B.M. more than a symbolic lift, I.B.M. stock did a little celebratory jig, rising 6 points the day after the match, to $173.50. The next day it traded as high as $177 -- higher than its peak a decade ago, before it began its long trek to oblivion and back. So you could say, it would seem, that Big Blue has returned -- but then again, look at how the Dow industrials have soared in the last decade. If I.B.M. had kept pace, it would be selling for around $500 a share.    LIQUOR  Sharing a Smaller Glass  There was a distinct if-you-can't-lick-'em, join-'em quality to the announcement last week that Grand Metropolitan and Guinness were joining forces in the fifth-richest merger in history. Those two, after all, are the world's biggest distillers, with many of the top liquor brands -- Johnnie Walker, Dewar's, Smirnoff, Gordon's, you name it. But people are drinking less, and especially less hard liquor. And while this may be considered good news for society, it is bad news for liquor makers. So these two giants are, essentially, admitting that the market is shrinking and trying to find ways to turn a profit anyway -- by, for instance, creating a ''premium'' image for more of their products to lure snobbish baby boomers.    CASHING IN  Those 'Seinfeld' Salaries  An alarming number of people -- whether on basketball courts or in corner offices -- earn sums that are alarming even if you knock off a couple of zeros. But when the ''Seinfeld'' co-stars agreed to grace Thursday night with their continued presence for a reported $600,000 each an episode -- more than $10 million a season -- it hit a special nerve. Why? Well, the likes of Michael Jordan and Michael Eisner seem to inhabit some alien planet, but Elaine, George and Kramer not only seem to perch, like batty friends, right in our living rooms, they also seem to perch in the battier corners of our subconscious. It makes us itchy to have people so close making such faraway sums. One could argue, though, that since ''Seinfeld'' earns NBC more than $200 million a year, and since those actors are key to the show's magic, of course they should cash in. One can only hope that the show's other geniuses, the writers, are also cashing in.    DRUGS AND DOLLARS  Does Prison Pay?  Assume, for a cold-blooded moment, that the issue of drug sentencing is a purely economic one. Does it make economic sense to mandate draconian minimum sentences? Absolutely not, says a study released last week by the Rand Corporation. The study calculates that spending $1 million on long mandatory sentences reduces cocaine consumption nationwide by less than 29 pounds a year, while spending it on discretionary sentences would have twice the impact. And spending that same million on treating heavy cocaine users would cut consumption by up to 220 pounds a year. Why are mandatory sentences so costly? Simple. It costs $20,000 to $30,000 a year to lock someone up. In New York State alone, prisoners put away under the Rockefeller drug laws cost $260 million a year. That could cover a lot of drug treatment.     DRIVING HABITS  From Cliche to Cliche  ''I wanted my own identity,'' a Michigan woman said defiantly as she traded in her mini-van. A reasonable request. The cliche dispensers had tagged her a ''soccer mom,'' lumping her with the armies of suburbanites ferrying the nation's little darlings around in blimps on wheels. And when she ditched her mini-van, she was not alone: after soaring for a decade, mini-van sales are finally slumping -- though they still outsell station wagons (remember them?) 5 to 1. But if this seeker of individuality, this fearless pioneer, thought she was breaking free of cliches, she didn't quite make it. What she bought instead was a sport utility vehicle, trading yesterday's cliche for today's.    WELFARE WAGES  Can Workfare Add Up?  It's always been easy to say that welfare is in a mess and has to be fixed. The hard part is making the numbers add up. If, say, lots of people lose jobs to make way for welfare recipients who are required to work, that's no solution. And many people, including governors of all political stripes, have long maintained that there's no way that welfare-to-work programs can pay the minimum wage and stay afloat. In addition, some say, paying minimum wage would reduce the incentive to step up to private-sector jobs. Last week, though, the White House decided that the overriding principle should be a living wage for all, saying that most workfare participants should get the minimum wage: $4.75 an hour.    NEW YORK CITY  The Great Rent Divide  New York is a city ripe with extremes -- of wealth and poverty, of creative energy and rage. No wonder, then, that one of the city's favorite political battles, that over rent limits, should be waged with such apocalyptic pronouncements on both sides. Those on the tenant side say the ending of rent limits would reduce the city to a wasteland, banishing the middle class and any remotely creative types, while landlords and their allies envision a different wasteland -- of ever more abandoned buildings. Last week Gov. George E. Pataki plunged into this perennially polarized debate with some suggestions for (gasp) a compromise: lifting controls now for some wealthy tenants and ending rent protection on vacant apartments. He didn't quiet the voices of apocalypse, though, as tenants voiced fears of landlord harassment.    LAWSUITS  Digital Vs. Goliath  Well, you can't accuse Digital Equipment of not thinking big. When it sued Intel last week, it was no narrow patent-infringement complaint. No, Digital, a faded Goliath in the computer game, was aiming at the heart of today's personal-computer industry. Intel, it asserted, stole some Digital designs when it created its Pentium chips, which just happen to be the nerve centers of more than 85 percent of the world's PC's. What does Digital want? It didn't say. But Intel, today's Goliath, earned $5.2 billion last year, and Digital could certainly use a few pennies of that. Although Digital's stock rose and Intel's fell on word of the suit, it's a wide-open question what Digital could win. The only certainty is that lawyers will have their usual feeding frenzy.    BANKING  'To Pay Fee, Press 4'  On the telephone these days, it's often a mercilessly multiple-choice world. ''Hello, this is your friendly computer. If you're happy, press 1. If your feet hurt, press 2. If you're going bald, press 3. There are no other choices. Have a nice day.'' When you call your bank, you're likely to face a similar stinginess of options, but with luck they'll fit your needs: your account balance, say, or determining whether a deposit has cleared. And the consolation of being treated like a microchip is that, well, at least it's free. It was, at any rate. Banks -- which seem to think up new fees by the day -- are starting to charge you to converse with the computer, with First Union hitting you for 50 cents a call after five monthly calls. That's a bargain, though, compared with talking with a human: after two calls in a month, First Union will charge you $2 a chat.

Sixty-one years after it was published, Carmer's book remains as essential to understanding the Alabama mind set as \\"Absalom, Absalom\\" is to an understanding of Mississippi.    Carmer, a New Yorker who taught at the university in Tuscaloosa, wrote of Alabama's \\"fatal compulsion\\" toward racial violence. The state broke the spell of that compulsion in the 60's, but these days it appears to be in the thrall of a less gory, but nonetheless perverse obsession.

Following its losses in the war and the terrific suffering which the whole civil population underwent Germany is of all European nations the one with the strongest pacifistic leanings. That they have not produced a film of this kind before now was due to the repulsion felt by every one at the very thought of war. But now they have gotten far enough away from it to be objective and Remarque's masterly novel has been followed by the talker, \\"The Western Front 1918\\" (Westfront 1918). With the possible exception of the pictures \\"Journey's End\\" and \\"All Quiet on the Western Front,\\" which unfortunately I have not yet seen, this is the most vivid argument yet contrived against war. A book or a speech are cold, dead things beside it. To the visual has been added all the resources of sound—no one can escape its appeal, from the university graduate to the peasant who can only sign with a cross. It is an undiluted dose of man's inhumanity to man—try and forget it if you can!Whether it is a work of art is another question. G. W. Papst, who directed it, is one of Germany's best, but he has not been able to form this chaos to a completely satisfying unity. I do not mean, of course, that he should have concentrated more on making a story of it but the whole should have had more inner structure, as in a symphony of Beethoven under Toscanini one is always conscious of the main outline although the details are in no wise neglected:Merits and Faults.The greatest merit of Papst's direction it would appear is that he keeps his actors natural. Unfortunately the Tobis sound recording leaves something to be desired in this respect. The noises of war are completely conveyed and, when the actors speak normally, the reproduction is adequate, but as soon as they talk with any emotional force the reproduction is unclear and metallic. The question as to whether the recording or the reproducing equipment in the theatre is responsible is one which I, of course, cannot decide—the critic has to take his sound as he finds it—here it seemed below par.The story, as I have already suggested, is a slight one, although founded on a novel, \\"Four from the Infantry,\\" by Ernst Johanhsen. It is a series of episodes in which four soldiers play the leading rôles. These are a lusty Bavarian, a young student, a married man and a lieutenant. The officer goes mad and is carried off screaming an ear-piercing \\"Hurrah\\" The student falls in love with a French girl but meets his death shortly after in a hand-to-hand struggle with the enemy in a shell-hole. The married man comes home to find his wife having an affair with another man and returns to the front with his feelings for her deadened. He and the Bavarian are mortally wounded and brought to a field hospital to die. These final scenes in the hospital are the apotheosis and justification of the whole film. With their unrelieved, unrelenting reality they drive home the senseless brutality of war as nothing elseBox Office Film Poll.\\"The best-laid schemes o' mice an' men, Gang aft a-gley\\" sang Robert Burns but the prognostications of critics always seem to miss the target. The Film Courier, an admirable German trade paper, has just published the results of a straw vote taken to establish the most successful pictures of the season. As three-fourths of all the German picture houses voted, the results must be considered pretty reliable. And what do we find? At the box office, where the likes and dislikes of the public are weighed with scientific detachment, \\"Woman in the Moon\\" (Frau im Mond) took first place. This Ufa \\"super,\\" directed by Fritz Lang, was from the critical angle the worst disappointment of the season.In second place came, considerably less surprisingly, that excellent Alpine tragedy, \\"The White Hell of Piz Palü,\\" which, I believe, is to be shown shortly in New York. Here critic and public stuck pretty close together. But completely unexpected was number three: The French anti-war film, \\"Verdun.\\" This was turned down by most of the distributers, and finally sold for a ridiculously small sum. Its big success again proves the strength of the German pacifist movement.Fourth appears the first American sound picture to be seen here, \\"Noah's Ark.\\" This mighty collection of all the clichées undoubtedly impressed on account of its overwhelming flood scenes. Then America is not represented again until the nineteenth position with Murnau's \\"Four Devils,\\" which was not very enthusiastically received in Berlin, but still seems to appeal as a plot in the smaller centres. Twenty-first was the American \\"Submarine\\"—a mediocre effort which probably got its standing on account of being the first silent with a synchronized score. And, immediately following it at twenty-two, was Emil Jannings in \\"The Patriot.\\" Here was a picture produced by Germany's best director, with Germany's favorite star in the lead and founded on a popular German play, and yet, despite the eulogies of the press, it received only this very moderate rating.

The story concerns the planned salvation of a financially embarrassed chocolate manufacturer (Herr Junkermann) by the marriage of his son (Tibor von Halmy) to the daughter (Fräulein Bos) of a prosperous rival maker of sweets. The manufacturer gets the needed assistance, but in another way.There are some amusing moments in the picture, and the acting of all the players is worthy of better material, although the veteran Herr Liedtke is rather past the dashing young officer age. It seems that the scenario writer was under the impression that there were modern passenger airplanes in pre-World War Germany, as such means of transportation play an important part in a film with a dialogue dating back about twenty-five years.

No doubt it required more time than that for Karl Ludwig Diehl, as a patriotic young German working in South America in 1914, to get back to his Fatherland.But then he was handicapped by being taken from a neutral passenger ship by a British cruiser, by a sojourn in and a daring escape from a concentration camp in Jamaica and by the persistent love of Brigitte Horney, disguised as the Ibero-American owner of the factory where he was employed as an engineer when the World War began. It required considerable time and much reasoning to convince the señorita that a man's country came before his sweetheart. As a screen reward for his patriotism Herr Diehl finally arrived in German waters, accompanied by the señorita ready to become a Frau.This picture is well photographed and the acting is excellent, although at times Herr Diehl seems a little too calm for a man presumably torn between love and duty. Herr Speelmans is first rate as another German lucky enough to reach home. The scenes on the high seas, in the camp and in Cuba are very realistic, although probably \\"shot\\" in the Canary Islands.

His resemblance to his faithful dog justifies the appelation \\"Schnauzer\\" freely applied to him by his acquaintances.The \\"plot\\" consists of a scheme engineered by friends of the aspirant (Rolf von Goth) for the hand of the Schnauzer's pretty niece (Ria Waldau) to keep her vigilant uncle out of the couple's way by playing upon his hope of winning a $25,000 reward for finding a supposedly abducted Chicago heiress.

While she is in the hospital following an accident, her husband, Hans, has an affair with Hedwig, the daughter of old friends. The girl becomes a mother and Maria eventually consents to divorce her husband. She goes to Berlin, where she is employed as a nurse for a child named Maedi Vogt. Maedi's mother takes advantage of the absence of her husband to flirt with her ping-pong instructor, with the result that the child sees but little of her mother. Maedi learns to love Maria more than her mother, but there arises a dispute between the two women and Maria is summarily discharged. Not long afterward Maria sees Maedi playing in a park and she kidnaps the youngster, with the result that she is arrested, but the testimony is so overwhelmingly in her favor that she is asked by the father of the child to return to his home and look after his child.This story may be set forth without a flash of levity, but it possesses a laudable sensitive quality. The photography is sometimes none too good.Miss Porten lends conviction to her part. Gustav Diesel does quite well as Hans Immerman. Ibolya Szekely figures as the temptress.

It is a wonderfully artistic production, in which there are countless ingenious ideas.\\"The Adventures of Prince Achmed\\" has already been shown in Berlin, Vienna and Paris. Mrs. Reiniger, a German silhouette artist, and several assistants, including Walter Ruttman, who was responsible for the settings of \\"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari,\\" spent nearly three years in making this production. The figures were cut in cardboard and sheet lead and articulated and posed for 300,000 different scenes.The American rights to this film were purchased recently by the University Film Foundation of Harvard. The picture presents an \\"Arabian Nights\\" tale in which there is Achmed, a sinister fellow with skinny fingers, known as the Sorcerer, two Princesses, an Ogress, who defeats, after a great deal of trouble, the machinations of the Sorcerer, and Aladdin, who, in this particular instance, has to light instead of rub his lamp. There is enough of a story to keep one interested and now and again the clever work elicited applause from the spectators.It may not be exactly new to perceive silhouette figures on the screen, but it is quite another matter as they are offered here. One sees a country lane come to light in the palm of the Sorcerer's bony hand and a tiny ship is rocked on the bosom of a paper ocean. Horses skip over mountains and fire leaps forth as the Sorcerer changes his form.As to the cast of cardboard players, they may be stiff in their movements, but they hop from Bagdad to China and have a frightful ordeal whenever the Sorcerer chooses to make things hard for them.

Heggie, who plays Cyrus Bumpstead, the henpecked husband in the pictorial translation of Martin Flavin's play, \\"Broken Dishes,\\" had kept within reasonable bounds of restraint in his performance, instead of clowning the part, this production, which happens to be known on the screen as \\"Too Young to Marry,\\" might have been a far more successful one. Aside from Mr. Haggie's somewhat painful overacting during most of his scenes it is a fair entertainment, for the producers have adhered closely enough to the original work, and therefore it does tell a tale and point a moral.As it is a farce comedy, other shortcomings can be pardoned. It interested and amused a small audience in Warners' Theatre yesterday afternoon. Even Mr. Heggie's antics stirred up some laughter.The Bumpsteads live in a dismal Western town. There are five of them, the mother, father and three daughters. Elaine, the Cinderella of the family, sympathizes with her father, who every night after dinner is forced by his wife to wash the dishes. Mrs. Bumpstead is constantly bemoaning the fact that she did not marry another man, named Chester Armstrong, instead of the meek Cyrus. She speaks of Chester Armstrong to her daughters in glowing terms. He was both a genius and an Adonis!Cyrus bears with his wife, but one night while she and the two daughters who side with her are at a motion picture theatre much happens in the Bumpstead home. Cyrus sneaks off to a lodge meeting of the Ancient Order of Secret Salamanders, where he encounters a stranger who has just come to town. This individual is none other than the much vaunted Chester Armstrong. Cyrus returns home the worse for imbibing applejack and discovers Elaine has not washed the dishes as she promised. She is not thinking of such routine work however, for Bill Clark, her sweetheart, whom Mrs. Bumpstead despises, is hidden in the parlor, and Elaine and he are contemplating getting married that night, provided she obtains the acquiescence of her father. Cyrus harkens to Elaine's plea, and soon the Rev. Mr. Stump appears at the home and performs the ceremony just before Mrs. Bumpstead and her daughters return. Meanwhile Cyrus has broken most of the dishes and Bill Clark has smashed a valuable vase, greatly prized by Mrs. Bumpstead. Hence, considering the wife's nature, it is no wonder that she is furious. To her dismay, however, Cyrus, the worm, turns, and he asserts himself with a vengeance.The excitement is heightened by the appearance of Chester Armstrong, bent on selling oil stock. Mrs. Bumpstead, who fawns upon her old flame, is finally rebuffed by Mr. Armstrong, who calls her an old crow. At that moment he is aware that the police are hot on his trail, and the last seen of him is when he is arrested at the point of a pistol, and one realizes that Mrs. Bumpstead's sweetheart of other days is a swindler who has spent many a year in prison and is known to the police by the sobriquet of Slick Chet.Loretta Young gives a competent interpretation of Elaine. Emma Dunn is efficient as the domineering wife. Richard Tucker acquits himself favorably as Armstrong. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"A German-Language Film. A Teutonic Operetta.

This production is also endowed with the presence of that attractive young actress, Lola Lane, who during one episode takes advantage of a natural opportunity to prove that she can sing.This pictorial story begins with a burst of criginality. Inside a jeweler's shop in Los Angeles a man and his wife are looking over diamond bracelets when suddenly the place is changed to a scene of wild excitement through the presence of a supposedly mad dog. Allan Grant, the salesman who had been showing the sparkling wares, leaps at the dog and after a long struggle seizes the animal by the scruff of the neck. One wonders why he had so much difficulty with the dog, but that is disclosed later.When the dog has been disposed of the manager of the jewelry store discovers to his chagrin that four of the most costly bracelets are missing. He upbraids young Grant for leaving the valacble articles on the counter, mad dog or no mad dog. The doors of the shop are locked and the customers are searched, but the missing bracelets are not recovered. There is reason for every bit of action in this clever narrative. Miss Lane, it may be admitted without spoiling the yarn for the spectator, is a detective who is eager to trap a band of crooks. William Dane and Lona Martin, who are not averse to posing as husband and wife, are the guiding spirits of the thieves. They are the two who were in the jewelry shop during the mad-dog incident, and not long afterward they are beheld on a steamship bound for Havana. Before the vessel leaves the dog is turned to good account, for the animal has a leather pouch in which during the struggle young Grant has inserted the missing gems.When most films have passed the half-way mark one knows the end. In this one it is possible to do a little guessing as to what will happen concerning two cerfain persons, but, even so, at the close one finds that the producer has kept one in the dark. Such a state of affairs as this deserves a pat on the back. The activities of the crooks and others aboard the steamship are filled with humor and suspense.It has been stated that Miss Lane sings during a natural Opportunity. This chance arises when a ship's concert is being held on the way to Havana. First, there is a woman who howls and then there is Miss Lane, who sings \\"Time Will Tell,\\" and in the film it tells a lot.Moreover, in this pleasing study there are scenes in Cuba and quite a number of energetic native policemen, who are on the alert when a boat leaves the ship and plows its way in the direction of Morro Castle.The surprises do not give out until the last sequence. Joan Anders (Miss Lane) gets her gem thieves and although they make a desperate struggle to wriggle off her hook, the pretty detective succeeds in her thrilling adventure.Miss Lane speaks pleasingly and without a trace of nervousness. Paul Page does nice work as Allan Grant. Kenneth Thomson is capital as the plausible diamond thief and Lona Martin has a way with her as the woman in the case. Warren Hymer impersonates a, hardened jail-bird and Joseph Girard figures as the sleuthing executive who \\"looks like Pershine.\\"The dialogue is bright and witty and the voices are reproduced in restrained and natural tones.Mr. Rothafel's stage contribution is produced with the usual artistry and charm of color combinations. Those lively Roxyettes are seen in two of the numbers.President 'Hoover is heard and seen on the Movietone news in his congratulatory address to Dr. Hugo Eckener, commander of the Graf Zeppelin.

For that occasion the St. Louis Art Museum is preparing a major retrospective exhibition of his work. It was to St. Louis, to teach in the School of Fine Arts at Washington University, that Beckmann first came to the United States in 1947. He was then 63 years old, and had been living in exile, mainly in Amsterdam, since 1937 - the year that the Nazis organized the infamous ''Degenerate Art'' exhibition in which Beckmann was conspicuously represented. (He had been dismissed from his teaching position in Frankfurt in 1933 when Hitler first came to power.) When Beckmann died in New York in 1950, he was serving on the faculty of the Brooklyn Museum Art School. Art View","excerpt":"A GLIMPSE OF BECKMANN'S ACHIEVEMENT"},{"year":"1945","title":"AMONG the war-born information films which have made an impress on public consciousness the \\"World in Action\\" series of pictorial editorials sponsored by the National Film Board of Canada are unique and significant. Aside from their political import, these two-reel subjects have explored and opened up new theatrical vistas for \\"think films.\\" Unlike the straight reportorial subjects supplied to theatres without cost by our Office of War Information, each \\"World in Action\\" release has to stand on its own feet, both from the standpoint of showmanship and practical commercialism.That these films have struck a responsive public chord and are paying their own way is evident by a glance at the distribution books at United Artists, the releasing agency. In this country \\"World in Action,\\" released about every six weeks, reaches approximately 6,000 theatres and an additional 5,000 theatres are reached in twenty different countries, including England and South America. But even more indicative of the impression these pictorial vivisections, as it were, of paramount contemporary issues and developments have made in responsible quarters is the fact that Australia and New Zealand have undertaken somewhat similar film programs. Moreover, it has been reported that Washington recognizes their value.Although the eight annual \\"World in Action\\" subjects are but a small part of the activities of the Canadian National Film Board—its principal function is to disseminate information at home—these films have turned the full glare of the spotlight on Canadian thought anent the international scene. It goes without saying that they represent the viewpoint of the Canadian Government, and, that being the case, Canada thus enjoys the attention of millions of theatre-goers of varied political and social philosophies. In this respect Canada stands unique among nations, as not even this country, with its sprawling and complex information establishment, can claim an international clientele ready and willing to pay for its information films.Sound ProphecySince the first \\"World in Action\\" release appeared in the fall of 1941 the films have often displayed a remarkable prescience of international developments. The initial issue, for instance, was \\"War Clouds in the Pacific,\\" which came out a scant month before the gathering storm clouds mentioned in the title broke in the deluge that was Pearl Harbor. And, though it only now has gone into theatres here, \\"Now the Peace\\" was planned many months ago and actually was previewed locally several days in advance of the official announcement of V-E Day. This is an eloquent exposition of the need for world cooperation to effect an enduring peace and it provides a lucid explanation of the structure and aims of the Dumbarton Oaks and Bretton Woods agreements.The guiding force behind \\"World in Action\\" is John Grierson, the tough, aggressive little Scottish intellectual who, perhaps more than any other individual, fostered the documentary form of pictorial expression in England and, since 1939, has been the Film and Information Commissioner of Canada. Grierson's right-hand man, and the one who does the writing and editing of the films, is Stuart Legg, a native Londoner and a keen student of international affairs. Legg, who is thirty-five, graduated from St. John's College, Cambridge, in 1931, where he studied engineering. But Legg's interests even then were directed more toward social and economic problems and it was this bent which took him into the documentary film field and to the attention of Grierson, who, as head of the Empire Marketing Board Film Unit, was attempting to promote inter-Commonwealth economic relations.Legg's commentary for \\"World in Action\\" subjects such as \\"Russia's Foreign Policy,\\" \\"Fortress Japan,\\" \\"When Asia Speaks\\" and \\"Global Air Routes\\" have revealed a keen, analytical mind which tears aside the \\"double-talk\\" of international politico-economics and strikes at the very heart of matters. But one has to size up Mr. Legg from knowledge of his work and estimations of persons closely associated with him, for, like Mr. Grierson, he shuns personal publicity to stress the importance of \\"teamwork-unity,\\" a principle which both firmly believe to be the foundation upon which a new world must be built.Pulling Together\\"All our people work strictly as teams in which the corporate entity is everything,\\" Mr. Legg said recently in discussing \\"World in Action.\\" \\"Since films are essentially things contributively made we reckon that their weight lies in the collective effort, and that the individual who claims a solo performance tends to become a feather in a vacuum. We therefore don't put personal credits on our pictures, and for this reason also we fight shy of personal publicity.\\"Although they have been interpreting some of the most volatile issues of the day for over four years, only one \\"World in Action\\" subject has run afoul of the Canadian Parliament and that was a hindsight film on Greece, \\"Balkan Powder Keg,\\" release of which was prohibited. It has been whispered about, not too silently, that the Canadian Government did not act without some prodding from 10 Downing Street to the effect that release of the subject might complicate Anglo-Greek relations. The secret behind this success in dodging political barriers, not only at home but abroad, is that the editorial sights of \\"World in Action\\" subjects are raised high above the level of nationalism. They interpret the facts squarely and by so doing have earned the respect of audiences who are struggling to understand more clearly the world in which they live.

The social-documentary vein tapped by Dorothea Lange, Walker Evans and other Farm Security Administration photographers in the 1930's no longer appeared as fresh as it once had.   And while photojournalism held center stage, in the hands of W. Eugene Smith and others at Life magazine, those who favored more personal, idiosyncratic forms of expression were consigned to waiting in the wings. According to this version of the medium's history, it was only in 1959, when Robert Frank's book \\"The Americans\\" was published in the United States, that photographers began again to explore new visual territory.

At Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., on a rainy Saturday night, at the first of two sold-out shows there, the Dead turned in what must be a rare thing, a whole three-hour concert that rarely flagged. The rhythm section meshed well, the singers, Jerry Garcia and Bob Weir, sang in tune and even harmonized without rough edges, and Mr. Garcia's improvisations, which can plod along at 15 miles an hour, actually hurried, as if he were trying to get somewhere.

Although its appeal is not altogether universal, this four-part compilation of fact films from the Soviets and Germany does offer some startling case histories and diverting evidence of expert and patient scientific and photographic work.While two of the four component sections of \\"Secrets of Nature\\" are secrets that have been revealed at the Stanley Theatre here previously, one of these, \\"Stork Story,\\" a Russian-made subject produced by the Mostechfilm Studio, is, in this corner's opinion, outstanding. An intimate and natural view of the danger-fraught life cycle of the stork from the moment a pair of migrating birds has been stopped in flight over the Ukraine until the fledglings leave the giant nest, the offering combines pastoral beauty, fine cinematography and research into an informative and effective document.\\"Death in the Desert,\\" filmed in Asia's Kara Kum Desert by the Russian Kievtechfilm Studio and also shown here before, is ample proof of the survival of the fittest.

But in the five years since 1980, investors have added an additional $400 billion to funds, putting them over the half-trillion dollar mark. ''If investors could keep this up, the funds would own everything,'' marvels Jon Fossel, marketing director for the Alliance Capital Management Corporation in Manhattan, which manages a group of mutual funds.\\n\\nWhile that is not likely to happen, open-end mutual funds, which sell investors shares in managed portfolios of stocks, bonds or other securities, still have plenty of room to grow. Two-thirds of all households with incomes above $30,000 do not own shares in any fund, and the funds' sales forces are eager to entice those holdouts into the fold.\\n\\nOne effective sales tool lately has been the funds' stellar performance, which has reflected big gains in both the stock and bond markets.

One morning last week, no less than three people -- the woman behind the counter at the post office, the man in the dry cleaning store and the young fellow who sold me a sesame bagel -- concluded our transaction with the instruction, ''Have a wonderful day.''     I can only try.   JOHANNA HURWITZ      The place: The waiting room for several shrinks, Central Park West.    The players: A woman, mid-40's","excerpt":"a golden retriever.    The day: Halloween.    Alone in the waiting room with her dog, a woman we know fastidiously dresses an obliging retriever in a flouncy, fussy fairy princess outfit, with billowing pouf sleeves of tulle and a skirt of layers of netting. She carefully fastens each rhinestone-encrusted snap and aerates the skirt's yardage for  maximum lift. After she ties the under-the-chin bow, securing the sequined tiara, and places the silver lame magic wand in the willing dog's mouth, she gasps with delight.    At that moment, the buzzer rings, heralding another patient for one of the suite's several shrinks. A man enters and stops dead in his tracks.    The woman looks up and sheepishly says,  ''I guess it's no mystery why I'm here.''    Without missing a beat, he says, ''Great costume; she looks just like a dog.''   RUTH KATZ      Scene: A recent Saturday night at the Sony theater at Broadway and 84th Street. The movie is about to start. Two women in front of me hold sumptuous-smelling designer coffees from the nearby Starbucks as we enter the theater.    Ticket taker: ''You'll have to finish those outside first.''    First woman: ''Could we go out and hide these under our coats and come back in?''    Ticket taker (not amused): ''No.''     Having smuggled my share of noshes into movies, I couldn't help thinking, ''Amateurs!''   GAIL MAZIN      To help pass the time on a cold and very long line for tickets at Radio City Music Hall, I tuned into the conversation of the two women in front of me. I decided very quickly that they were both visitors to New York City, and strangers to each other. This was provisionally confirmed by their competitive comparisons of the sights each had seen and their planned adventures for the rest of the week. It was definitely confirmed when one pulled from her pocket a very detailed handwritten itinerary for the week: Monday, Statue of Liberty; Tuesday, Empire State Building; Wednesday, Rocker Fella Center. The thought of those Rockefellers making all their money in the rocking chair business kept me smiling all the way to the box office.   DAVID R. AVRUTICK     Strolling up Broadway on the Upper West Side, I passed a storefront that had been gutted and was being totally reconstructed.  Workman struggled with large cinder blocks while others busied themselves pouring cement. Passers-by constantly stopped and asked the workers what kind of store was going into the location. They shrugged and in broken English said, ''Don't know.''    They must have got tired of the questions because on my way back down Broadway there was a hand-printed sign at the site:  ''Don't ask. We don't know nuthin.''   FRANCIS X. BRADY      Entering a suburban post office recently, I held the door for a woman who was exiting with her tow-headed little boys, probably 3 and 4 years old.

Seeing the show on Braodway is always nice (Harvey Fierstein is Tevye at the moment), but Norman Jewison's film adaptation captures the magic of the original 1964 Jerry Bock and Sheldon Harnick musical, from ''Tradition'' to ''Anatevka.''

The influence of Minimalism was such that for a long time human imagery was almost inconceivable to sculptors with radical aims. In recent years, as modernism has lost much of its authority, the work of sculptors who started out with one foot in Minimalism, such as Joel Shapiro and Alain Kirili, has included increasingly direct references to the human figure. If their work is seen alongside some of the 1980's work of Nancy Graves, Bryan Hunt and John Duff, it is clear that a sculptural momentum toward the human figure has been building.     The curators of ''Figures,'' Tom Finkelpearl and Claudia Gould, have brought together work by 12 sculptors, most of them little known, all of whom work with the human figure in what can be roughly described as an expressionist manner. All the work in the show is large-scale","excerpt":"a good deal of it is polychrome and in wood.

To be sure, it is a hurried, somewhat hop-skip-and-jumpy trip that the spectator will find himself experiencing, for to travel, even pictorially, through England, France, Belgium, Italy, Turkey, Egypt, Palestine, Java Siam, the Philippines and Japan in about two hours requires a little scurrying and permits only glimpses at the countries visited.

On the whole, it is about the most entertaining motion picure on Broadway today.But it could be much better than it is. The pictures themselves, apparently, were taken at different times, and have been assembied to give the imprssion of a continuous journey. Those who took them did their best. Those who assembled and edited them have done their worst. In a misguided effort to jazz up the journey the subtitle writers have inserted a great deal of sorry humor, and, where they have not tried to be funny, they have been bromidic, often giving the impression of what the true traveler would receive from the vapid remarks of a provincial person abroad. It is assumed that more than one person wrote the subtitles. They could hardly have resulted from the effervescance of a single mind.And the attempt to put pep into the film by the well-known method of speeding up the action in the pictures is also irritating.Despite all this, however, the pictures remain, and they are interesting.

A1    In a series of grisly discoveries, Iraqi authorities found the bodies of 46 people, some of soldiers and some apparently of civilians, in Baghdad and three other cities.   A12    Magazine Apologizes  Newsweek apologized for printing a small item about reported desecration of the Koran by American guards at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. But it did not retract the account, which was linked to riots in Pakistan and Afghanistan and led to the deaths of at least 17 people.   A1    U.S. Warns North Korea  The Bush administration warned North Korea that if it conducts a nuclear test, the United States and several Pacific powers will take punitive action, but officials stopped short of saying what kind of sanctions would result.   A1    Panel On Iraq Faulted  A former investigator for a committee examining the United Nations oil-for-food program in Iraq has accused the committee of compromising its investigation by giving Secretary General Kofi Annan internal information that violated the confidentiality of a witness in the inquiry.   A13    Uzbek Fighting Continues  Skirmishing between armed citizens and Uzbek troops has continued since the government suppressed a mass demonstration by force on Friday. Unverifiable reports of the number of deaths since the violence began varied widely, from dozens to hundreds of civilians.   A3    Iran Seeks to Defy Outsiders  Iran's Parliament has passed a nonbinding resolution insisting that the government resume developing enough nuclear fuel to produce a substantial amount of electricity, defying the American and European demand for a halt in all nuclear activity because they contend Iran seeks to build a nuclear bomb.   A8    Palestinians Allowed Weapons  Palestinian policemen are now permitted to carry their weapons in most West Bank cities for the first time in years, a move that is one of the few signs of coordination between Palestinian and Israeli officials in recent weeks. The shift is based on an agreement reached in recent talks between Israeli and Palestinian officials that had not been previously announced.   A4    A Shadowy C.I.A. Killing Effort  The killing of a suspected operative of Al Qaeda in Pakistan eight days ago by a missile launched by a remotely controlled Central Intelligence Agency aircraft was the latest such strike in a shadowy effort that both Pakistani and American officials have sought to hide, according to two former counterterrorism officials.   A12    NATIONAL   A14-19    Class and Income Are Linked to Health  The more education and income people have, the less likely they are to have and die of heart disease, strokes, diabetes and many types of cancer. Upper-middle-class Americans live longer and in better health than middle-class Americans, who live longer and better than those at the bottom. And the gaps are widening, say people who have researched social factors in health.   A1    Church Shaken by Remarks  The Rev. Chan Chandler, the young minister who led a Baptist congregation of about 100 people in Waynesville, N.C., for the last three years, resigned under fire last week for asking members to ''repent or resign'' if they voted for John Kerry in the last presidential election. Some younger members have since left the congregation.   A1    California Mayoral Race  Los Angeles voters will once again choose between James K. Hahn and Antonio Villaraigosa for mayor, a rematch of the 2001 contest, which Mr. Hahn won with a late surge. But conditions this time are starkly different. Mr. Villaraigosa, a member of the City Council, is seemingly on his way to victory.   A16    Study Finds Cancer Care Varies  New studies show that Americans generally receive high-quality cancer care but that closer monitoring is needed to explain significant geographic variations in practices. Cancer specialists also said they needed improved training in communication so they can better advise terminally ill patients about how long they have to live and help them choose the care they wish to receive.   A17    Judge in Filibuster Battle  Justice Priscilla R. Owen of the Texas Supreme Court, who is now at the center of the partisan battle in the Senate over changing the filibuster rules, declined a chance to be the court's first female chief justice last year so she could remain one of President Bush's nominees to a federal appeals court, Texas lawyers and political figures said in recent interviews. The decision was one of three crucial moments in her judicial career in which she seemed to have been guided by the hand of Karl Rove, President Bush's chief political strategist.   A18    Yalta Debate Reignited  When President Bush declared on May 7 in Latvia that the 1945 Yalta agreement led to ''one of the greatest wrongs of history,'' he reignited an ideological debate from the era of Joseph McCarthy. For more than a week now, the left and the right have been arguing over the president's words. Mr. Bush has criticized Yalta at least six other times publicly, usually in Eastern Europe.   A18  Health Care Funds Misused  Money earmarked by Congress for investigating fraud against Medicare, Medicaid and other health programs, appears to have been shifted improperly to other purposes, like fighting terrorism, Congressional auditors say in a new report.   A18    NEW YORK/REGION   B1-6    Dinkins Being Courted By Bloomberg and Rivals  David N. Dinkins, the former New York mayor, maintained a low political profile for several years after he left office. But now, he finds himself courted by Mayor Bloomberg and sought after by the four major Democratic candidates running to oust him.   A1    Hearts Sink in a Navy Town  The Pentagon's announcement that it will close the Navy's submarine base in Groton, Conn., has stunned the town, which has been home to the base for nearly a century and calls itself ''The Submarine Capital of the World.''   B1    Foster Children, With Babies  One in six young women in foster care in New York City are pregnant or are already mothers, according to a new survey by the Public Advocate's Office. These young women, ages 13 to 21, are not getting the housing or training that they need to become responsible mothers, according to the report.   B3    SPORTSMONDAY   D1-9    Yankees Win Eighth Straight  The New York Yankees' winning streak reached its eighth game with a 6-4 victory over the Oakland A's, completing a three-game sweep.

In 1864, it passed to George Merritt, who doubled its size with the money he made by inventing a shock-absorbing spring for railroad carriages, which is how he met Jay Gould, the railroad baron, who bought the house in 1880 and added the country's then largest greenhouse.   For anyone who would like to find out what happened next, especially to Gould's two very interesting daughters, the Municipal Art Society is conducting a tour called \\"Lyndhurst -- Gothic-on-Hudson,\\" next Saturday.

I refer specifically to the neighborhood known as the Lower East Side, an area of equal historic richness imparted by its waves of immigrants, which today, more than ever, is so neglected that its crime, drug, unemployment and deplorable housing conditions probably rival some of the poorest slums of the developing world.   Of course, we need to celebrate that beautiful bridge as well as to enjoy the rich heritage that the Seaport will represent. Yet it is certain that both the ingenuity it took to build the Brooklyn Bridge and the marvelous expertise given to the restoration of the Seaport buildings would be most welcome if focused on alleviating the inhuman conditions of the Lower East Side. Indeed, some of the new shops and restaurants at the Seaport could certainly make an impact on the unemployment problem endemic to this area.  My hope is that the city will muster, once and for all, the total of its abilities and talents and, together with all the activist groups fighting poverty on the Lower East Side, restore the Lower East Side neighborhood, not only physically but spiritually, so that it could continue to provide its strength and diversity that has contributed so much to the quality of life of New York City, a quality of life that gave America so much.","excerpt":"A GREAT BRIDGE, A SEAPORT-AND A SLUM"},{"year":"1996","title":"To the Editor:         Having read Alex Ross's article \\"A Musical Flood, but Not Unwelcome\\" [Jan. 14], I am amazed that there is no reference to one of Purcell's greatest champions of the 20th century, the countertenor and conductor Alfred Deller.

With marble floors, scattered Oriental carpets and occasional furniture, many look like the comfortable old-guard living rooms or hotel lobbies after which they were originally modeled.    But over the last decade, three urban changes have greatly enhanced the city's inventory of lobbies. New shareholders in apartment buildings that have gone co-op have taken an active, proprietary interest in renovating their lobbies","excerpt":"a greater awareness about historic preservation has created an increased concern for the care and restoration of older lobbies, even those without an esthetic pedigree; and, finally, loft conversions have created a need for residential lobbies in former commercial buildings.    The New York architect Gerald Allen - currently redesigning two lobbies in Upper East Side and West Side buildings that recently went co-op - explains that some lobbies in rent-controlled buildings lapsed from their original designs when landlords modernized them. The owners were allowed to raise rents because of these capital ''improvements''; often these efforts were less than sensitive.

This failing is apparent in almost every important situation. It would have been wiser to exclude some of the minor incidents so as to have sufficient footage to devote to the all-necessary dramatic impetus.It is all very well to have a super-hero in such narratives, but this man among men should occasionally show signs of being human. Captain Henry Harrington (Mr. Meighan) never steps down from his pedestal, not even after he has saved the town from destruction by a furious mob. Fire in the vicinity of the jail causes Harrington's release. He had been held there on prohibitive bail at the behest of a conspiring capitalist. Once he is free. Harrington, with the aid of the Indians whom he led in France, subdues the wild rioters and is therefore more of a hero than ever. Instead of challenging the capitalist to put him back in prison. Harrington calmly announces that he must return to jail. This subtitle caused a titter from the audience in the Rivoli yesterday afternoon.In justice to Joseph Henabery, the director, it should be explained that it is difficult to lift such a story out of the usual rut. It should be handled by an enthusiastic scenario writer whose work would guide the director in making the most of the dramatic features. However, Mr. Henabery has accomplished much with the players, which after all is quite a solace when viewing any picture. Bessie Love gives a splendid performance as Lahleet, the half-caste heroine, who never fails Harrington, who had endeavored at the risk of his own life to save her brother in the World War. Miss Love's make-up, the tanned skin and braided blue-black hair, are singularly well suited to her features.Boland, the evil genius who profited by the war to deprive the Indians of their land, schemes to purchase älso the small area left. He knows there is oil on the reservation, but carefully keeps this to himself. Harrington eventually fights to see that the Indians get justice and is waylaid and robbed when he is carrying money to one of the Redskins. The Federal courts eventually decide that the Indians are entitled to the whole town of Edgewater, which infuriates the inhabitants, not against the Indians, but against Boland and his lieutenants. They stone Boland's office and the sight of fire suggests setting fire to scores of other dwellings. This scene is well pictured, as is also the sequence in which Harrington is seen leading the armed Indians. The angry mob declines to cease its incendiarism and Harrington thereupon orders his men to load their rifles and aim. This action causes the mob to bolt in fear.The settings are natural and the direction of the crowds is capable. Eileen Percy figures as Billie Boland, the attractive daughter of the capitalist. Miss Percy is charming in this part and almost makes one sympathize with her father, who after all only wanted to make a good deal. We don't see that it was absolutely necessary for him to broadcast the fact that he knew there was oil on the reservation.Although this production does not prove as exciting as it might, it is never irritating. Mr. Meighan's acting is restrained and sympathetic. However, we would prefer seeing him in a story such as Booth Tarkington or George Ade can write for him.

He was 90 years old and lived in Athens.   His death was caused by a stroke, the hospital said.   Mr. Minotis performed in, and often staged, classical dramas from many nations in his native language at home and abroad. His frequent leading lady was Katina Paxinou, his wife, who died in 1973.   He interpreted not only the works of ancient Greece, but also those of Shakespeare, Ibsen, Strindberg, Pirandello, Brecht, Beckett and O'Neill. He was particulary praised for his title roles in \\"Hamlet,\\" \\"Henry V\\" and \\"Richard III,\\" as well as for Shylock in \\"The Merchant of Venice.\\"   Mr. Minotis, who spoke a resonant English, adhered to traditional values, but he enriched classical production with contemporary knowledge, remarking in 1980: \\"when I'm playing Oedipus, I cannot overlook Freud.\\" A Message of Dignity    He was hailed in half a dozen countries for his performance in \\"Oedipus the King.\\" He later returned to the character in \\"Oedipus at Colonus.\\" The latter play, he said, held this timeless message: \\"While man may be helpless in controlling what happens to him, within himself he can choose to live honestly and to die with dignity.\\"   Mr. Minotis, whose original name was Alexander Minotakis, was born in Canea, Crete, on Aug. 8, 1900, the third of 10 children of a fabric merchant. The youth rebeled at tradition and vowed to become an actor when he saw his first play, performed by a traveling company, at the age of 12.   After finishing his military service in 1925, he joined a theater company in Athens and began working with Miss Paxinou. The couple then joined the newly created National Theater of Greece. They were married in 1940, 12 years after they met, when World War II threatened to separate them.   She fled to Britain and the United States, while he was captured twice by the Germans. He finally escaped to Cairo and joined her in Los Angeles, where he played bit parts while she had major character roles. In 1950, they were able to return to Athens to re-create the national theater, form an experimental company and travel the world, bringing new life to ancient tragedies and modern innovations.

That night, another terror bomb hit, this time inside Israel, killing two and wounding scores in the coastal town of Hadera.  By week's end, there was a phone call between Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, engineered by Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, but hopes that the conflict could turn a corner grew ever fainter.

The German Jewish actor and cabaret performer Kurt Gerron was recruited by the Nazis to create a propaganda documentary about Theresienstadt to divert the suspicions of the Red Cross. The footage of Gerron, hard at work constructing his mammoth and monstrous fiction, is one of the most numbing spectacles you're likely to see in a film, nonfiction or otherwise. &quot","excerpt":"A grotesque and shameful lie,&quot; says Ian Holm in voiceover narration, and he also describes the obscene misinformation conjured by the Nazis to hide what was really a concentration camp: &quot;a self-sustaining commune of like-minded people: artists, scientists, craftsmen and entertainers.&quot; &quot;Paradise&quot; eventually posits the notion that Gerron was a lost soul himself; he refuses Peter Lorre's offer to bring him and his family to America because the trip can't be booked in first class. He's so subservient to what he believes his station to be that his life becomes like the operatic tragedies directed by Josef von Sternberg or G. W. Pabst; he's undone by his own hubris, which he finally comes to recognize too late. The story rolls to a recap of the opening moments &#151; the making of the faked film, which a Red Cross observer is invited to see. Gerron's childlike self-absorption makes him an object of pity, and several of the witnesses are forgiving of his behavior. His final fate &#151; he was later shipped to Auschwitz &#151; could be a reason for their attitudes toward him. But the real question posed by &quot;Prisoner of Paradise&quot; &#151; for what price does a man sell his soul, and is it worth it? &#151; is never really answered. That is what a great film often does, but this one seems to just drift to a close instead of pronouncing an end. That can be the result of wrestling with an immense piece of material, and not being up to its demands. &#151; Elvis Mitchell Putting a Smiley Face on a Nazi Camp"},{"year":"1970","title":"CORTLAND, N.

There was one in a film last week at the Mark Strand and now there is another in the present pictorial feature at the Roxy Theatre. This new combination of laughter and excitement is called \\"The Wizard,\\" and it is said to have been adapted from Gaston Leroux's play, \\"Balaoo.\\" It is quite a good entertainment weakened by the levity forced upon it. This subject really has enough of a story to deserve more serious treatment. It has a motive and could have been fashioned into a genuinely exciting shadow yarn. The producers have been far too eager to touch more or less gently on the ruddy portions of their chronicle and then leap quickly to rowdy comedy.Here one perceives the dignified spectacle of an admittedly gruff and not particularly brainy chief of detectives hopping along the sidewalks handcuffed to his office chair. He had done this trick himself to show Stanley Gordon, an irresponsible newspaper reporter, the speed with which these shackles could be used. As Mr. Gordon has been told by his city editor that if he does not discover a new angle on a murder story he will be discharged, this young man takes advantage of the ignominious plight of the detective to answer his telephone and to hasten to the house where a second strange killing has occurred.This story has an interesting dénouement, but it is brought out too abruptly. Richard Rosson, the director, spends too much time trying to create spine-chilling effects by huge shadows and creeping hands, and it is also a pity that he should have given two black-face fun-makers more footage than their vaudevillian antics deserve.The scenes with a mad surgeon and a queer gorilla are quite cleverly pictured, especially when the spectator is taken through a room by means of the camera. This is the type of production that is spoiled by hearing too much of the detail, but it can be said that the gorilla is shot by the heroine. Yesterday afternoon when this happened a lady with a sigh of relief said to her husband: \\"That was a good shot.\\"Edmund Lowe as Stanley Gordon does quite well in some scenes, but he ought never to be permitted to appear so often in a smiling mood. Leila Hyams is graceful and attractive as the girl with whom Gordon is in love. Gustav von Seyffertitz, who impersonates the mad surgeon, does some capital acting. George Kotsonaros, in a fuzzy skin, makes the most of the gorilla's share in this photoplay.S. L. Rothafel's stage numbers are unusually artistic.

Satirical, at times almost allegorical, and full of surreal touches, it is also at times ponderous and rambling. It begins, for instance, with a somber and preachy voice-over, to the effect that life is full of small but meaningful stories and that what follows will be one of them.From there, it details the adventures of a pair of transit workers who have lovingly repaired a ramshackle old trolley, only to learn that the streetcar company has decided the car is obsolete. The two get drunk that night and steal the trolley, piloting it around Mexico City until they can safely return it the following evening.They have no set course in mind, but the car is commandeered over and over again by peculiar bands of people. An impatient schoolteacher loads her children onto the car, and soon anarchy reigns","excerpt":"a group of wealthy businessmen climb on board and are shocked and irritated by the crew's refusal to collect fares. In another, shabbier part of town, peasant women decide that anyone who won't take money is probably a thief.On board the trolley, the mood is deadpan and decidedly strange. A butcher climbs on and calmly sets up shop, carving meat and hanging up carcasses. Two women carrying a plaster saint wander along in the middle of the night, on their way to church to have the saint blessed??? it seems this noctu???nal urge strikes them regularly, the way the craving for chip dip affects others.This behavior is never made to seem grotesque; in fact, it hardly seems out of the ordinary. At its best, the film inhabits a cool, only slightly distorted fantasy world that has its own eccentric rules of decorum.The film ach???eves this tone effortlessly much of the time, but occasionally it strains, as when a neighborhood party includes a little morality play that casts the trainmen as God and the Devil.

THE SEVEN SISTERS, by Margaret Drabble. (Harcourt, $25.) A novelist whose work has considered primarily the issues of her own generation now employs a protagonist in her 60's who begins a new life, estranged from husband and daughters, undertaking a voyage in the wake of Virgil's Aeneas from Carthage to Naples.    THE NAVIGATOR OF NEW YORK, by Wayne Johnston. (Doubleday, $27.95.) A bold novel centered on the competition between Peary and Cook to be known as first at the pole; to real life Johnston adds the fictional Devlin Stead, through whom we sense the engrossing white waste of the North and the flaws of its heroes.    THE CAVE, by Jos&#233; Saramago. (Harcourt, $25.) The cave in mind is Plato's, where shadows pass for realities; the characters in Saramago's latest novel live in a complex where they work, shop and enjoy simulated experiences, victims not just of global capitalism but of their own eagerness to go along.    THE SKEPTIC: A Life of H. L. Mencken, by Terry Teachout. (HarperCollins, $29.95.) This biography copes with Mencken's crankiness, his provinciality and his inability to believe Germany was doing wrong in the 20th century by placing them in contemporary contexts.    SEEK MY FACE, by John Updike. (Knopf, $23.) Updike mixes art history with fiction in a story, recollected later by its hero's widow, of how in the decade after World War II American artists, led by Jackson Pollock (here called Zack McCoy), seized power from Europe and made New York the center of the art world.    HAZMAT: Poems, by J. D. McClatchy. (Knopf, $23.) Another collection by a poet who carries forward the strict, literate, exact tradition of Auden and Merrill, but with a physical focus on bodily organs and products that preserves his fluency and intricate forms from aestheticism.    OFF TO THE SIDE: A Memoir, by Jim Harrison. (Atlantic Monthly, $25.) A sprawling, roundabout report on the life lived large by a writer who is fairly sprawling and roundabout himself; hunting, fishing, eating a five-hour meal with Orson Welles, making vast money in Hollywood and misplacing it, offering no apologies for his participation in ''the incalculable messiness of life.''

Dedicated to the development of the medium and the needs of artists, the workshop led in the open-studio concept and has been available to any artist needing that type of creative environment.

His body is as frail as a grown man's can be, but his musical ideas are dense, even assaultive, pouring from him as relentlessly as when he reshaped modern jazz guitar in the early 60's. Then, as he ends his first solo before an audience in a decade, the crowd responds explosively, and Mr. Martino slips out of character and cracks a radiant grin. He seems genuinely surprised by the reception.\\n\\nBut what goes unsuggested by his smile is the ambivalence Mr. Martino feels toward the style of music that made him an icon before his 18th birthday. Mr. Martino sharpened the bite of jazz guitar, embracing the fluency he inherited from Wes Montgomery and shooting it through with freewheeling harmonies and a pungent sense of the blues. Even in his commercial heyday, he was a baffling persona, moving unpredictably between jazz, rock and Eastern styles. When he receded into silence in 1980 after a severe brain hemorrhage, his transformation from prodigy to jazz eccentric to legend seemed tragically complete. With the release of a new disk, \\"Interchange,\\" and another, \\"The Maker,\\" due this fall, Mr. Martino, at 50, is back, but he is plotting new musical directions -- adding more layers to his myth.

The most impressive of these, Ana Torres's \\"One Thousand and One Faces,\\" begins with a hazy, rapidly arpeggiated sequence of eerily voiced chords. Its closing section was deliciously contrapuntal, with traces of bluesy note-bending and sliding. Leo Brouwer's \\"Cuban Landscape With Carillons\\" was full of effects put to musical use.

For having \\"personality\\" he wins a diploma from a correspondence school and is fortunate enough to marry an attractive girl, named Peggy, who, herself, has aspirations to become a Greta Garbo and own a limousine.The adventures of this couple are never particularly convincing, although the acting is quite good. This picture was directed by James Cruze, producer of \\"The Covered Wagon,\\" and it is doubtful whether he has ever handled a more meaningless narrative than this present offering.It is \\"Mel's\\" misfortune to meet Charles Groff, a tall, athletic individual, whom \\"Mel\\" looks upon as a man's man. Mr. Cruze in his direction of Groff seems to have endeavored to make him a sympathetic scoundrel, and then permitted him to make his exit like the conventional blackguard. Groff is a discredited motion picture employe who makes a haphazard living by selling oil stock to those who are brainless enough to buy it. \\"Mel\\" is so eager to become interested in the oil business that he worries Groff to let him have $200 worth of the spurious stock. This money represents the savings of \\"Mel\\" and his wife, so the soda dispenser refrains from telling Peggy about the purchase, hoping, of course, that he will make a fortune from it.Groff also listens to Peggy's ambitions and promises her that he will see that she becomes a motion picture actress. This cheery scoundrel later tells a number of men about Peggy, and they all laugh boisterously over the idea of a girl wanting to be a second Greta Garbo. Among those who listen to the story is \\"Mel,\\" who does not know that the girl, to whom Groff refers, is his own wife. And he does not recognize himself when described as one of the \\"biggest eggs that has ever come out of a barnyard.\\"The manner in which \\"Mel\\" has his eyes opened to his young wife's aspirations is accomplished by turns and twists that are only amusing because of their absurdity. \\"Mel\\" and Peggy then have a frightful fuss and eventually \\"Mel\\" in his desire to be a man's man, goes forth to chastise Groff. He does not have to go far before he finds the swindler, and soon there is an encounter in which \\"Mel\\" comes off decidedly second best. As for Groff, he leaves the scene of the fray smiling.This is followed by further squabbling between Peggy and her husband, until \\"Mel\\" decides that he is going to leave his bride. He packs his big suit case and soon Peggy starts to help him. They can't get the bag shut and first one and then both sit on it, which action causes them to hark back to the time when they were first married.\\"Mel\\" feels that he ought to thrash Groff, and Peggy says that she will come to see him do it. Through the kindness of Mr. Cruze, \\"Mel\\" is able to land a straight left on Groff's jaw, and in the course of the struggle that follows \\"Mel\\" has the upper hand. It ends in Groff being knocked out, which pleased a number of people yesterday in the far reaches of the Capitol.Sam Hardy gives a sterling portrayal, so far as he is able, of Groff, but it is on the whole a disappointing part. Josephine Dunn is comely as Peggy. Mr. Haines frequently anticipates the action in his expressions and he relies too much on sneers and smiles. In one sequence, however, where \\"Mel\\" is supposed to be inebriated, Mr. Haines does excellent work.After the picture is finished, one concludes that it is an example of much ado about nothing.

STAMPS","excerpt":"A HALF-CENTURY MARK FOR THE NEW DEAL'S T.V.A."},{"year":"1995","title":"PROBABLY no other people in Europe attach as many myths to their forests as the Germans, and few other countries have as many forests as Germany. One of the largest, spookiest, most legend-enshrouded and least known to foreign visitors is the Spessart -- 800 square miles of wooded hill country east of Frankfurt, tucked between bends of the Main River and one of its tributaries, the Kinzig. \\n\\nThe Spessart, Hessian-Franconian vernacular for Spechtswald, which means \\"woodpecker forest,\\" gained notoriety in the 19th century through the novelist Wilhelm Hauff's stories about highway robbers who waylaid travelers and had their hideouts there in isolated inns. The bandits were not fiction, for highway robbery was once a plague in these woods, though Hauff, a fervid romantic, depicted them as Teutonic versions of Robin Hood and made their lairs seem eerily frightening.\\n\\nThe Grimm brothers, brought up in Steinau, one of the forest's most picturesque towns, used the Spessart as the setting for many of their fairy tales. Those, locals insist, were not all fiction either.  Today the lore serves as enchanting background to one of Germany's most rewarding and relaxing travel destinations. It can be explored in four to five days with about 200 miles of driving, primarily on scenic country roads, between the principal sights. For business visitors it is also an ideal long weekend out of Frankfurt, which is only 45 miles from the heart of the Spessart.\\n\\nMiltenberg, population 9,500, is a good starting point and base for discovering the forest's southern -- Bavarian -- part and the wine country around the gently flowing Main, which has become a major artery for barges carrying freight between the North and Black Seas since opening of the Rhine-Main-Danube Canal in 1992. The town is also a port for leisurely excursion-boat trips along the river. Much of the red sandstone, characteristic of the Spessart's architecture, is quarried at and around Miltenberg.\\n\\nMiltenberg was a Roman military base as early as A.D. 160, but its golden era was the 14th through 16th centuries, thanks to the prince-archbishops of Mainz, who built Miltenburg Castle, which is spelled differently. The castle, which stands on the steepest hill overlooking the town, served both as a border point and customs station to levy duty on the traffic on the river. \\n\\nMost of the half-timbered, steep-roofed houses of its medieval merchants, craftsmen, sandstone quarriers and wine dealers still line the narrow, cobblestone main street that curves for almost a mile between the river and the densely wooded hillside. \\n\\nA seven-mile drive south from Miltenberg and the Main leads to Amorbach and a startling change of architectural eras: from Gothic and Renaissance to late Baroque, due mainly to this small town's beautiful Abbey Church.\\n\\nAmorbach and its abbey were founded in 734 by Irish Benedictines who played a key role in Christianizing the Germans. In 1734, while celebrating the monastery's millenium, the Mainz archbishop decided to replace the whole Carolingian, Romanesque and Gothic complex with one in the Baroque style, which was then fashionable. \\n\\nThe architect, Maximilian von Welsch, retained famous stucco and fresco artists such as Johann Feichtmayr and Matthaus Gunther to do the interior decorating. It took only seven years to complete the opulent, eye-dazzling ensemble. The monks capped it with a new organ, which has almost 5,000 pipes and 63 registers.\\n\\nThe glory of Amorbach ended in 1803 when Napoleon redrew the map of Europe.  He abolished the German church-states, secularized the abbey and gave it to the Counts of Leiningen in compensation for properties in Alsace-Lorraine that they had ceded to the French. The Leiningen family still owns and runs the complex.\\n\\nThe only way to see its splendid interiors -- a whirl of gilded stucco, Gunther's breathtaking ceiling frescoes of scenes from the life of St. Benedict, Feichtmayr's trompe l'oeil effects -- is on guided German-language tours that are conducted at 40-minute intervals daily March through October. They include the richly decorated abbey library with its 30,000 volumes and the Green Room, which was the abbot's reception chamber.\\n\\nFrom Miltenberg it is 20 winding, scenic miles northeast and upstream along the river to Wertheim, a picture postcard town of 20,000 beneath the ruins of its 11th-century castle at the confluence of the Tauber River with the Main. First mentioned in documents in 779, it was for nearly 800 years -- until 1806 -- the capital of an independent principality ruled by a succession of noble dynasties. Its partly walled old quarter is a pedestrian zone","excerpt":"a half-day of walking here, and a climb to the castle ruin 300 feet above the town, will take you to the most important sights. Among these are the 14th-century Collegiate Church, the Historical Museum in the former Renaissance-style City Hall and the Glass Museum.\\n\\nFrom the early Middle Ages until the Nazi Third Reich, Wertheim had one of the Main River valley's largest Jewish communities. But they were often the victims of persecution long before the Holocaust. One of the worst pogroms was in the early 15th century. A reminder of it is St. Mary's Chapel, a small church built in 1447 on the ruins of what had been the town's oldest synagogue. The old Jewish cemetery on the outskirts, at the base of the castle hill, has been fenced off since Germany's latest wave of neo-Nazi violence and can only be visited by applying for a key from the city administration. But at its gate there is a bronze tablet, commemorating by name the 38 Jews who were still living in Wertheim in 1942, when the Final Solution started. They were all subsequently deported to death camps.\\n\\nThe 21-mile drive north and upstream from Wertheim to Lohr leads through the loveliest section of the Main Valley and one of the lushest parts of the Spessart. Two hamlets along this route -- Rothenfels and Neustadt-am-Main -- merit a stop. Rothenfels was once a principal fishing and shipping center on the Main. Some 450 feet above its snug, crazily leaning half-timbered houses is a perfectly preserved 12th-century castle that nowadays serves as a youth hostel. Neustadt-am-Main, three miles farther, was founded in 769 as a Benedictine abbey. Its red sandstone basilica is a rare example of pure Romanesque architecture. The monastery, rebuilt after destruction during the Napoleonic secularization, is now the European headquarters of the Dominican order and a training center for missionary work in Africa.\\n\\nLohr, population 17,000, the eastern \\"gate to the Spessart,\\" is a picturesque maze of narrow cobblestone streets, medieval watchtowers, Gothic church spires and half-timbered houses. More important, citing research by Karlheinz Barthels, a local pharmacist and \\"fabulologist,\\" it maintains it is the real Snow White town. According to Barthels, she lived in Lohr's moated, turreted 14th-century castle, which now houses the Spessart Museum.\\n\\nThe Spessart Museum with its walk-in exhibits of life in the area centuries ago can keep you busy for hours, especially the horror chamber that describes the real highwaymen who robbed teamsters and mail coaches in the Spessart in the 1700's and early 1800's.\\n\\nThere are no fairy tales associated with Mespelbrunn castle, 19 miles southwest of Lohr, though it would be a perfect stage set for one. The salmon-colored Gothic-Renaissance chateau is tucked into a hilly landscape of dark, lush woods and surrounded by a broad moat. \\n\\nThe castle has been the property of the Counts of Ingelheim-Echter von und zu Mespelbrunn for over 500 years, and they still live in it, but they open one of the three wings to visitors daily, from March through November, except when a family event is being celebrated. \\n\\nThe highlights are the knights' hall with its coffered ceiling and hunting trophies, the 15th-century chapel with its beautiful stained glass windows and alabaster altar, the main dining room with its 16th-century fireplace and collection of armor and weapons and the Chinese room, crammed with Chinese and East Asian porcelain, furnishings and bric-a-brac.\\n\\nFrom Mespelbrunn it is 11 miles northwest to Aschaffenburg, a city of 65,000, named for the little Aschaff River, a tributary of the Main. Though its written history goes back to the seventh century, the town entered its golden era in 1260 when the prince-bishops of Mainz chose it as their second residence. It was they who built its splendid 17th-century Johannisburg Palace on a promontory overlooking the Main and who richly endowed its SS. Peter and Alexander Collegiate Church.\\n\\nMuch of the city was destroyed during World War II, and what little of architectural value remained was demolished by urban renewal in the 1960's.\\n\\nEven the massive, three-story Renaissance palace was gutted and not restored in its entirety until the 1970's. Built entirely of Miltenberg red sandstone on the ruins of an earlier archdiocesal castle, it is overwhelming in its dimensions and symmetry: four wings, each nearly 290 feet long, enclosing a 26,000 square foot courtyard, with four corner towers more than 170 feet high. The enormous building today houses a number of government offices and three major museums. The Palace Museum encompasses eight ornately furnished rooms of the Mainz archbishops and princes. The Pompeianum, in the Palace Garden, is an exact copy of a house in Pompeii, commissioned by Bavaria's King Ludwig I in 1843. This building, too, was almost totally destroyed in World War II and finally reopened -- as a museum of Roman antiquities -- in August 1994.\\n\\nAschaffenburg's Collegiate Church, 10 minutes' walk from the palace, is an example of late-Romanesque and early-Gothic styles from the 12th and 13th centuries. The church abounds with ecclesiastical art, including a small \\"Lamentation of Christ\\" by Matthias Grunewald, done when he lived in Aschaffenburg.\\n\\nFrom Aschaffenburg the route into the state of Hesse's section of the Spessart leads 12 miles north through Alzenau, a romantically situated town, crowned by a 14th-century castle, and from there 15 miles northwest to Gelnhausen.\\n\\nSet on a steep hillside above the Kinzig River, Gelnhausen looks frozen in the Middle Ages when it was one of the most important points on the main trade route between Frankfurt and Leipzig. It is a treasure trove of narrow, winding cobblestone streets lined by crazily tilting half-timbered houses, some of them almost 800 years old, and it is still partly enclosed by its medieval wall.\\n\\nGelnhausen was chartered in 1170 by Holy Roman Emperor Frederick Barbarossa after he had built a huge, partially fortified palace there on the banks of the Kinzig. The ruins of that castle with its elaborately carved Romanesque arches and capitals are among the must-see sites.\\n\\nThe town was booming by 1200 when work began on its St. Mary's Church, a vast red sandstone structure with four Romanesque and Gothic spires that can be seen from miles away. Among its interior furnishings are fine 13th-century stained glass windows, ornately carved choir stalls, an intricately sculptured rood screen, a polychrome high altar from 1500 and 15th-century tapestries.\\n\\nGelnhausen, historically, had a large and illustrious Jewish community. The most poignant reminders of this are the old cemetery down by the river bank not far from the Barbarossa castle, and the 17th-century synagogue on Brentano Strasse.\\n\\nBecause the synagogue had previously been secularized and forcibly sold to a non-Jew who was using it as a warehouse, it was one of the very few synagogues in Germany that escaped destruction in the Kristallnacht pogrom of 1938. Now owned by the city, it was restored in 1986 and has been used since then as a cultural center, art gallery and concert hall. Its elaborately gilded, stucco-marble Torah ark is one of the few left from the Baroque period.\\n\\nSalt that bubbled forth from subterranean springs was one of the Spessart Forest's principal export products in the Middle Ages. One of its main sources, exploited since the 11th century, was at Bad Orb, eight miles northeast of Gelnhausen. The springs are still bubbling, but since 1837, when a local pharmacist began using the waters for medicinal purposes, the town has been a spa and health resort. Sixty thousand people converge on Bad Orb each year to take the waters; driving on 10 more miles to Steinau is more relaxing.\\n\\nSteinau-an-der-Strasse is where the Grimm brothers -- Jacob and Wilhelm -- who collected and wrote down all the famous fairy tales, spent their boyhood years, after their father had been appointed the local magistrate in 1791. They lived in the 16th-century Renaissance courthouse, which is now the local museum. \\n\\nSteinau has a history going back to about the year 700 and was chartered as a city and market place in 1290. It was an important junction on the salt and trade routes in the Middle Ages, and long a piece of real estate contested by the prince-bishops of Fulda and the counts of Hanau.\\n\\nWhen the Hanau counts gained control, they fortified the town and built a moated castle with walls over 90 feet high, a daunting challenge to the bandits who lurked in the Spessart. Today it ranks as one of the largest and best preserved Renaissance castles in Germany. It, too, is a museum, open daily except Mondays, with a fine collection of 15th- to 18th-century furnishings, Flemish Gobelins and a permanent exhibition of documents dealing with Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm, and their younger brother Ludwig, who was an artist and provided illustrations for some of their fairy tale collections.\\n\\nSteinau has a vibrant cultural life as well. Central to it is the Marionettentheater, a puppet theater in the 16th-century stables of the castle. The family that runs it performs Grimm classics such as \\"Snow White,\\" \\"Rumpelstiltskin,\\" \\"Cinderella,\\" \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" and \\"Puss in Boots\\" almost daily.\\nA SAMPLING OF ATTRACTIONS ALONG THE MEANDERING MAIN\\nGetting There\\n\\n All destinations are within an hour's drive from Frankfurt or about four hours from Munich, using autobahn routes.\\nGetting Around \\n\\nIt is advisable to take along a very detailed road map or road atlas (Shell and Aral are the best), though road signs are clear.

It is available at bookstores and gas stations in the area. \\n\\nThe country code for Germany is 49; when dialing a phone number within the country, the area code should be preceded with a 0.\\n\\nMain River boat trips are best from Miltenberg.

A child is killed in this bleak and affecting film from Hungary, but the story also suggests how children's spirits can be deadened early on. The hero, a somber 12-year-old boy named Zsolt, lives a hopeless life caring for his ailing grandmother in their tiny apartment. When he takes violent action, is he acting out of some innate immorality? Or is he another victim of a society that abandoned him?   The director, Ildiko Szabo, has created a precise and moving route to these larger questions. The scenes of Zsolt painstakingly bathing his grandmother, singing to her and helping her put on her wig and makeup each morning are presented with an eerie fascination. \\"It's morning,\\" reads a sign Zsolt leaves on the blackboard for her. \\"Everything is on the table.\\" Each scene evokes pathos without sentimentality.

In \\"Hysterical Blindness and Other Southern Tragedies That Have Plagued My Life Thus Far,\\" the actor Leslie Jordan traces the psychological journey that took him from Chattanooga, Tenn., to Hollywood, while an ensemble in choir robes sings satiric variations on hymns that give voice to the Southern-bred sense of shame Mr. Jordan says he can never entirely escape.   This is all executed with a fervid eagerness to please, and Mr. Jordan has the good sense to wink occasionally at the self-importance of such an enterprise. (\\"Where were we in this unabashed soul-baring saga?\\" he asks.)

He accepts the dare and in seeking for material discovers an ancient castle in the Tyrol where dwell the Baron von Keller (Mr. de Segurola) and his daughter (Miss Montenegro). The daughter shows the visitor a painting representing the invasion of Austria by the troops of Napoleon Bonaparte. Then the action jumps back more than a century with the hero in the role of a French Lieutenant who wins the Austrian lady away from her fiancé (Mr. Parera), after many amusing incidents and a wild ride through the mountains in the best Hollywood style.The finale reveals the composer and the heroine bowing to an enthusiastic Viennese audience and inviting the spectators to their impending wedding.

Here was a chance not only to be in the movies, the radio spots said, but to win a drawing on a free automobile.   But by late morning on a hot Saturday in June, there were barely 1,500 people inside Fulton County Stadium, hardly enough to fill the seats behind home plate. So Ray Stark, the Hollywood vizier who is producing the film for Columbia, quickly concluded that some extra inducement was needed. Instead of just free hot dogs, he decided he would give away money, too: a check for $1,000 every hour, on the hour, to some lucky spectator up in the stands.   It made a difference. By Sunday morning, there were nearly 10,000 people in the stadium, spread out behind both dugouts while the crew set up the shots that called for everyone to leap to their feet every so often and cheer lustily for an imaginary home run. Then they would sit down and wait for the movie people to give away more money and more prizes.

I am speaking most particularly of the tendency away from the austerity of orthodox modern architecture and toward an architecture that re-uses historical forms, accepts the possibility of ornament, and emphasizes the relationship of a building to its neighbors.   When the American Telephone & Telegraph Company in 1978 accepted the design of Philip Johnson and John Burgee for a 37-story, granitesheathed skyscraper in midtown Manhattan with a Renaissance-inspired bottom and a Chippendale-inspired top, that was a significant event - a kind of beginning of this journey, the first instance of the acceptance of what has come to be called ''post-modern'' architecture by a rich and powerful corporation.  Since it was the patronage of the American corporation that was the real factor behind the triumph of modern architecture in the 1950's, A.T. & T.'s decision was a major symbolic step in the withdrawal of that acceptance.

In this deeply personalized work (at Manhattan Theater Club's Stage II), Groundhog is partly based on Ms. Swados's own sibling, who died after years of living as a street person. For fictional purposes, he is combined with a character like Joyce Brown (also known as Billie Boggs), who became a subject of controversy in New York in the late 1980's. Acting as playwright, composer and director, Ms. Swados is unflinching in her response to the madness of Groundhog (David Schechter), a figure to haunt anyone's nightmare.

But Ms. Muller is also concerned with darker themes suggested by life around her. She balances the light and dark in \\"Righteous About Passing (on the Left),\\" a piece about the anomie and creativity of urban life that was performed by Jennifer Muller/The Works on Sunday afternoon at the Joyce Theater. But when Ms. Muller deals overtly with social themes, the mix is frequently an uneasy one. And that was the case with her new \\"Regards,\\" also performed on Sunday.    The solo, which is set to songs by Tracy Chapman, depicts a homeless man and intends to trace his journey from despair to anger and self-assertion. John Brooks rises only to fall again in the solo's first section. By the end, less coiled with tension, he is on his feet until a final descent into the huddled position with which the dance opened. There are some powerful moments, most of them when Mr. Brooks is still, clutching his head, letting the music flow by in the opening section.

Indeed, it was inevitable, given Mr.  Reagan's determination to achieve large budget savings by cutting programs such as welfare, food stamps and Medicaid, which benefit to low-income working families.   The discovery of ''work disincentives'' in President Reagan's welfare policies has given his critics ammunition, even as the ''fairness'' of his overall program has become a volatile political issue. Congress rejected Mr. Reagan's 1983 budget in part because it was seen as inequitable. The desire of many members to dissociate themselves from this perceived inequity was evident last week.

The author's first book-length narrative is a journalistic account of a thief caught pilfering 200 rare orchids and plants in Florida, but its true subject is the monomania of collectors and growers, who can wait seven years just to see a new plant bloom. This peculiar mania is revealed as ''a small thing of grandeur, a passion with a pedigree,'' Ted Conover wrote here last year.    The Hours   By Michael Cunningham. Picador USA, $13.    The theme of this Pulitzer Prize-winning novel is the haunting of present lives by memories and books, and it evolves in three connected narratives: that of a New York woman whose life echoes events in Virginia Woolf's ''Mrs. Dalloway''","excerpt":"a housewife in 1940's Los Angeles who reads the book; and Woolf herself in 1923, living near London and writing her novel. ''The overall impression is that of a delicate, triumphant glance, an acknowledgment of Woolf that takes her into Cunningham's own territory, a place of late-century danger but also of treasurable hours,'' Michael Wood wrote in these pages in 1998.    Rocket Boys: A Memoir   By Homer H. Hickam Jr. Delta, $12.95.    This nostalgic coming-of-age story is set during the Sputnik era in dreary West Virginia coal country, where the author (a future NASA engineer) and five pals undertook an audacious series of rocket launchings that captured the imagination of a dying region. ''He is a very adept storyteller,'' James R. Gaines wrote here in 1998.    Bad Chemistry   By Gary Krist. Berkley, $7.50.    A headless body, a combustible dog and ''The Tale of Peter Rabbit'' are among the plot elements in this taut mystery about an ex-policewoman trying to track down her missing husband. ''Fascination with the power of secrets . . . holds the book together,'' David Willis McCullough wrote in these pages in 1998.    Inventing Wyatt Earp: His Life and Many Legends   By Allen Barra. Carroll & Graf, $15.95.    In 1881, a 30-second gunfight helped create an American hero and a stirring myth of frontier justice. It turns out that accounts of Earp's career and the shootout were full of ironies, confusion and outright falsehoods. This ''refreshingly pugnacious book'' aims to set the record straight, Richard E. Nicholls said here last year.    Elegy for Iris   By John Bayley. Picador USA, $13.    The British literary critic chronicles his long, rich relationship with his wife, the novelist Iris Murdoch, and her descent into Alzheimer's disease. ''In its evocation of the lyrical, the comic and the tragic, this splendid book enlarges our imagination of the range and possibilities of love,'' Mary Gordon wrote here in 1998.    There Once Was a World:   A Nine-Hundred-Year Chronicle of the Shtetl of Eishyshok   By Yaffa Eliach. Back Bay/Little, Brown, $25.    A historian recreates in intensely rendered detail the daily rhythms of life in her family's shtetl, a town in what is now Lithuania whose 3,500 Jews were nearly all murdered. Her account contains numerous photographs and interviews with survivors. In 1998 our reviewer, Stephen J. Dubner, called this ''an exhaustive and kaleidoscopic history.'' ''The Rest of Us'': The Rise of America's Eastern European Jews, by Stephen Birmingham (Syracuse University, $22.95), is the final installment in the author's trilogy on Jewish immigrants in America. It is a broad canvas filled with portraits of colorful characters like Irving Berlin, Meyer Lansky and Ralph Lauren. ''Trenchant observations permeate this book,'' Sydney Zion wrote here in 1984.    Face-Time   By Erik Tarloff. Pocket Books, $12.95.    A rising White House speechwriter is horrified when the president takes a shine to his girlfriend. She's flattered, of course, and tempted by the prospect of ultimate insider access. The result is a novel ''about sex and power in Washington that goes behind the headlines to a darker place,'' Patricia O'Brien wrote here last year.    Falling Slowly   By Anita Brookner. Vintage Contemporaries, $12.    This novel focuses on two willfully hermitic sisters torn between a desire for connection with the larger world and a greedy complacency about their carefully sheltered existence. Brookner is ''the unrivaled mistress of the stifled life,'' Claire Messud wrote here last year.    Foreign Bodies   By Hwee Hwee Tan.   Washington Square/Pocket Books, $12.95.    This first novel is about a young lawyer in Singapore who has nine days to prove that her English boyfriend is not the mastermind of an international gambling ring. ''Tan spins out a gripping story,'' Anderson Tepper wrote in the Book Review last year.    Winter Count   By Barry Lopez. Vintage, $11.    Many of these stories focus on obscure figures and incidents in the Plains and Rockies, and are informed by American Indian culture and mystical wisdom.

Riders bound north on Amtrak or Metro-North's Hudson Line today can see the same sight if they venture north of Cold Spring. A thousand feet out into the Hudson sits Bannerman's Island, with its strange ruins, looking like something out of a 19th-century engraving.         On the maps it appears as Pollepel Island, but the name of Francis Bannerman, the arms dealer who bought it in 1900 and built on it an amateur architectural tribute to his Scottish roots, has overshadowed its earlier history. Bannerman started his business at the age of 14, buying 90 percent of the captured ordnance from the Spanish-American War. Eventually he became the country's biggest surplus arms dealer, building an enormous store and warehouse containing his own private munitions museum on lower Broadway. After he was informed that New York no longer wanted his huge arsenal within city limits, he needed a place to store it. A relative had recently sailed past the seven-acre island, about 50 miles north of the city, and thought it might be an ideally remote place to keep explosives.

In 1983 the trade deficit doubled to $60 billion, and in the first quarter of this year it was running at an annual rate of $120 billion.    There are plenty of reasons for the recent deterioration, starting with the overly strong dollar. From 1980 to early this year, the dollar rose by an average of about 50 percent in comparison with the currencies of the 10 other major industrial countries.

It was a night of sprawling solos, unbalanced ensembles and ad hoc structures. But with Mr. Murray at its center, the music regularly worked itself up to ecstatic peaks.         Mr. Murray applies the tactics of gospel preaching to jazz solos. He starts out easygoing, navigating chord changes with humorous asides. Then he grows more vehement, hardening his tone and building speed, until he's barreling through all the registers of his instrument, from honks to overblown squeals. He can play perpetual-motion lines, but he usually phrases his solos like speech. His solos are grand perorations, full of technical feats and visceral fervor.

Adopting the folksy tone of a next-door neighbor, Mr. Linke confides the most intimate details of his life during the 10-year marriage, from his final LSD trip to the home birth of his first child to his tasting of his wife's final tear at the moment she died.    The bulk of the story is about her illness, her desperate pursuit of nontraditional treatments, and how Mr. Linke and the couple's two children (a third was born a year before she died) dealt with the crisis. Although the actor throws in too many show-business references, and the script's moments of comic relief ring a little too pat, the play, which has toured around the country and was shown on Home Box Office four years ago, is still very gripping. One leaves the theater surprisingly uplifted.

U.S. Broadcasts Keep Cubans Posted in Crisis","excerpt":"A Hypocritical Policy"},{"year":"1930","title":"Madness and mutiny on the high seas are the basic ideas of \\"The Ship from Shanghai,\\" a talking pictorial adaptation of Dale Collins's novel, \\"Ordeal.\\" It is a wild, hysterical melodrama, which in spite of the zealous efforts of Charles Brabin, the director, hardly affords the intended excitement. The principals give good performances, particularly Louis Wolheim, but much of the time one feels that the players are at the mercy of the crudely written lines and the ludicrous situations.Mr. Brabin's work at times recalls that of Cecil B. De Mille. The sympathetic characters are invariably dull-witted, while the scoundrels are endowed at least with good eyesight, keen hearing and no little cunning. Mr. Wolheim portrays the steward among a scratch crew aboard a yacht bound from Shanghai to San Francisco. This steward, named Ted, is alleged to be a paranoiac, his particular form of dementia being that he hates the idle rich, the way they talk and, what he presumes to be, their affectations. His irrational conduct increases during the voyage, and finally he, with the aid of a pistol, becomes a mad tyrant who enlists the support of the other men in the fo'castle, refusing to give the passengers, the owner and his four friends food and water.In the course of the hectic events Howard Vazey (Conrad Nagel) is beheld on deck with Dorothy Daley, played by Kay Johnson. Miss Daley, in spite of the fact that she and her friends are suffering from both thirst and hunger, has the temerity to tell Vazey that she is happy, \\"for nothing matters when a woman is in love.\\" There are other absurd lines when Miss Daley goes to Ted's cabin, and the climax is reached when she persuades the crazed steward to look at himself in the mirror. This has the desired result, for he smashes the looking glass and finally hurls himself overboard, muttering something to a passing shark.In the end, when the crew has abandoned the vessel and Ted has gone to a watery grave, Miss Daley asks Vazey if they are going to heaven or the United States. His answer is \\"both,\\" and the Swedish cook, who had helped Ted in his violence, sums up with \\"I ben tank so.\\"When Ted does fire his big pistol he is always a bad shot, for he only wounds the men at whom he shoots. No matter whether the other members of the crew or the owner and his friends are discussing their plans, the repugnant steward is always eavesdropping and he goes forth smirking, knowing exactly what all aboard the ship intend trying to do.A good deal of time is spent in the early scenes with glimpses of a dance. While Vazey is gliding over the floor with Miss Daley he stops to squirt a syphon first on the ceiling and then at some of the other persons on the floor. This temporary outburst of alcoholic insanity does not cause Miss Daley to favor Vazey's attentions, but when the yacht is becalmed, Vazey becomes the hero, who, if the villain had not been very careless, might easily have been killed.Mr. Wolheim is alternately a sneering and then a violent steward. His acting merits a more restrained narrative. Miss Johnson also contributes competent work, but her part is quite spoiled by the melodramatic lines she has to speak. Holmes Herbert is another participant in this blood-and-thunder affair who suffers through what he has to say and do.Texas Guinan, clad in bright red and a rhinestone headgear, takes part in the stage contribution. It is one that is lacking in good taste. She is said to be supported by \\"her original Guinan gang of entertainers.\\"Laurel and Hardy appear in a clever but boisterous talking film known as \\"The Brats,\\" in which these hardy comedians play both the fathers and their children.
