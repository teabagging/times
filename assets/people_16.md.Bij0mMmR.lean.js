The straw hat occupies a special place in the smart wardrobe, and whether in town or at the seaside, a man is never quite so breezy as when he sports a gleaming boater or spanking white Panama.\\n\\nThough mentioned by name as early as 1833, ''Panama hat'' is actually a misnomer. While Teddy Roosevelt became an American icon in 1906 when he wore one in the cab of a steam shovel digging the Panama Canal, the hats themselves have never been made in Panama. Their name is probably a corruption of Carludovica palmata, the stemless screw pine of the Latin American tropics whose immature fan-shaped leaves are split into the long and remarkably flexible straws from which the hats are made. According to Annie, Lady Brassey, writing in 1885, the plant itself was sometimes called the hat palm, and the Journal of the Society of Arts observed in 1900 that ''Everywhere in Latin America the hat is known under the name of 'Jipijapa' in honour of the city \\n[\\nin Ecuador\\n]\\n where its manufacture was first started.'' Misnomers aside, the highest class of Panamas - fino fino - are almost as rare as hens' teeth, and far more expensive.

This weekend two other free events end one series's season and begin another's. FREE FOR ALL AT TOWN HALL winds up an offbeat but pleasing season with a recital by the mezzo-soprano SUSANNE MENTZER and the guitarist SHARON ISBIN; the two have taken their act on the road for several years now and recorded a CD, ''Wayfaring Stranger.'' Their program on Sunday has a Spanish theme, with music by Granados, Albéniz, Falla and others. At 5 p.m., 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 707-8787; tickets, two per person, are available at noon.    On Tuesday the NAUMBURG ORCHESTRAL CONCERTS begin in Central Park. The series is misleadingly named because the first concert features not an orchestra but the eclectic woodwind quintet IMANI WINDS. Describing itself as African-American and Latino, the group, joined by the pianist ANDRÉ-MICHEL SHUB, will offer music by Piazzolla and Paquito D'Rivera as well as an arrangement of Ravel's ''Tombeau de Couperin,'' a Mozart wind quintet and a piece called ''Umoja'' by the group's flutist, Valerie Coleman. At 7:30 p.m., Naumburg Bandshell, midpark at 70th Street; (718) 340-3018; free.    Summer also signals a time to leave town on weekends, and out-of-town festivals are accommodatingly opening their doors. The SUMMERSCAPE FESTIVAL at Bard College opens with a bang and a dance or two on Thursday. The dances, by the DONNA UCHIZONO DANCE COMPANY, are choreographed to music by Liszt and Michael Floyd (the latter newly commissioned); the bang is provided by the percussion and cembalo of the Hungarian group ROMANO DROM. (Liszt, you see, is the theme of this year's Bard Music Festival, around which SummerScape is loosely programmed.)

A1    Bolton Accusations Detailed  A former assistant secretary of state charged that John R. Bolton had so bullied an intelligence analyst over Cuba's suspected weapons programs that it shook the intelligence bureau and prompted the secretary of state to intervene.   A1    Iraqi Women Seek Power  Women, who make up a third of Iraq's first elected Parliament in decades, agree they want more political power. But they are divided between those wanting to bring Iraq in line with Islam's divine law and those with more secular views.

And yet the Tokyo summit conference that ended today - the 12th annual meeting of the leaders of the seven biggest industrialized democracies -set something of a standard, as these things go, for addressing problems directly. Perhaps more than at any previous meeting in the series, the weasel words, the paperings-over, the fudges to which the leaders have so often resorted in the past to create at least some semblance of unity were for the most part unnecessary here.   The reason was an ample supply of that ephemeral commodity, political will. It was present in Tokyo, and it made possible a cohesion that surprised many of the participants, for a seemingly paradoxical reason: a degree of disunity only two or three weeks ago that they all knew had to be remedied.

People were saying that the man needed cue cards to talk about the gross national product.   Here, at his sixth economic summit conference, the man still needs help. Before dinner with the other six leaders on Sunday night, reporters were firing questions at him as he and his fellow leaders stood for photographs, and Margaret Thatcher of Britain and Yasuhiro Nakasone of Japan would whisper in his ears. But they whispered the questions, not the answers. All the help Mr. Reagan seems to need, at 75 years old, is a better hearing aid. Learning to Compromise    President Reagan is riding high here.

Ever since Winston Churchill called for ''a parley at the summit'' in 1950, face-to-face diplomacy at the highest level has been called summitry. He warned that such dealing ''should not be overhung by a ponderous or rigid agenda or led into mazes of technical details,'' and took a potshot at the conference preparers (later called sherpas, after those Himalayan tribesmen who help mountain climbers reach their summits), giving the back of the Churchillian hand to ''hordes of experts and officials drawn up in a vast cumbrous array.''

This musical style, combining exotic sound effects, tonal cadences and recollected melodies, may now be the most dominant one of our time. It can be extraordinarily effective (as in some of David del Tredici's or Alfred Schnittke's music) or almost formulaic in impact, as Mr. Baker's work seemed in this performance by the New York Philharmonic conducted by Leonard Slatkin.   \\"Shadows\\" (1990) is, in the composer's words, \\"nonverbal commentary on four haiku texts of macabre imagery.\\" The music is meant to illustrate the images, which in these cases are of moonlight, grave mounds, autumn winds and bitter tears, and amplify them with additional associations.

In fact, the common wisdom in Silicon Valley has been that Sun would simply be gored by the twin horns of ever-cheaper and faster personal computers and Microsoft's commercially oriented NT operating system.   But Sun, which prides itself at being both quirky and arrogant, has been counted out before.   \\"As usual, reports of our demise are premature,\\" said Eric Schmidt, Sun's chief technology officer.   Now the computer maker is set to catch up in the work station business and may end up giving fits to its chief competitors -- Hewlett Packard, Digital Equipment, Silicon Graphics and I.B.M.   Sun, which introduced the $10,000 Voyager, its first \\"transportable\\" work station, yesterday, will soon add the Sparc 5 and Sparc 20, work station models designed to refresh the performance of Sun's desktop systems and put the company back \\"in the hunt\\" in the performance-sensitive work station market -- a market it created.   Several weeks ago the company, based in Mountain View, Calif., treated analysts to a sneak preview of its new product family scheduled to be introduced later this month. Since then the buzz that the new products have created has begun turning some heads on Wall Street. The word is, there has never been a better time to buy Sun's stock, which had been languishing in the $20 range since the beginning of January.   But the buzz has already prompted buying. Yesterday the stock closed at $29.875, up 50 cents. While the stock is still below its 1987 high of $45.75, it has risen 8 percent in the last five trading days. But trading all year has been volatile. The stock closed last year at $29.125.   \\"I don't always have kind things to say about Sun, but I do right now,\\" Laura Conigliaro, an analyst at Prudential Securities, said. \\"If you're going to buy Sun, this is the window.\\"   What Sun did wrong in the past was essentially fumble the transition between one generation of its Sparc microprocessor and the next, when its ally Texas Instruments took far too long to complete designing a crucial new chip.   That could have been fatal, but during the period that Sun lagged in performance, none of its competitors could dislodge it from its 30 percent share of the work station market.   \\"Sun has been a company that is perceived to have lagged technically,\\" said Doug van Dorsten, a stock analyst at Hambrecht & Quist in San Francisco, \\"but they still have the largest market share, so they're doing something right.\\"   That something, he said, was to develop systems that spoke directly to the needs of its core customers, who wanted to \\"downsize\\" -- move critical applications off expensive mainframes into the Unix work station market.   That, in turn, has protected the company's margins in the last year, because Sun's high-end server computers have sold better than the computer maker's internal projections.   \\"Any way you look at it, Sun is an inexpensive stock,\\" Mr. van Dorsten said. \\"You could make a credible case that Sun should be valued as high as Hewlett Packard.\\" Currently Hewlett Packard is selling at $90, three times Sun's price.   In addition to getting higher marks from Wall Street analysts for getting its technology act together, Sun also has a solid business story. A number of analysts said that Sun had managed its business efficiently in the last year, holding its inventories significantly below both Hewlett Packard and Silicon Graphics.   And the company recently restructured its distribution channels, cutting back from five or six to just two distributors, thereby halting price discounting and maintaining profit margins.   \\"To their credit, they've never been out of it,\\" said Jeffry Canin, a financial analyst at Salomon Brothers in San Francisco. \\"It's quite astonishing that they've done as well as they have.\\" Market Place","excerpt":"Sun Microsystems says reports of its demise are premature."},{"year":"1996","title":"Sun Microsystems Inc. agreed yesterday to buy Lighthouse Design Ltd., a provider of object-based developer and productivity tools.

Among the dozen songwriters who have contributed to this witty early-60's-style revue spoofing the perils of travel, the show's musical director, Stan Freeman, and its bass player, Jay Leonhart, have provided several of the best bits. Mr. Freeman's ''Paradise Found'' extols the highly questionable pleasures of roughing it in Uzbekistan. Mr. Leonhart's ''Customs'' is the complaint of an explorer detained in customs with his menagerie. The level of humor is not as scattershot as it is in most such shows.

Ronny Whyte, a pianist and singer, concentrates on the mature Sinatra, joined by Tom Postilio, who emphasizes the dreamy 1940's singer of ballads, and Hilary Kole, a perky swinger, bridging the gap.

Classical Music    ISABEL BAYRAKDARIAN. For some years the Marilyn Horne Foundation has been doing good work on behalf of young singers by presenting them in solo recitals across the country. Every selected artist gets a recital in New York, and this weekend the soprano Isabel Bayrakdarian has her turn. The 25-year-old Canadian of Armenian descent, who recently created the role of Catherine in William Bolcom's opera ''A View from the Bridge,'' will present a recital at the Kosciuszko Foundation with the pianist Carrie-Ann Matheson.

This program would be mightily attractive if only for its choral and orchestral aspects, as Jane Glover conducts the Concert Chorale of New York and the Greenleaf Chamber Orchestra in Bach's ''Magnificat,'' Beethoven's ''Choral Fantasy'' and Haydn's ''Theresienmesse.'' But the pianist in the Beethoven, Garrick Ohlsson, comes as a substantial bonus. The vocal soloists -- Dana Hanchard, Phyllis Pancella, Steven Tharp and Stephen Morscheck -- are also accomplished.

YAKOV KASMAN. At the 1997 Van Cliburn International Piano Competition, this Russian pianist gave a series of fiery, individual performances that won him the competition's Silver Medal. He also won the top prize at the Artur Rubinstein Competition in Tel Aviv in 1992 and the International Prokofiev Competition in St. Petersburg in 1995. For his New York debut recital, he is playing Prokofiev's Sonata No. 8, Medtner's Sonata in G minor, Schumann's ''Waldszenen'' and Stravinsky's Three Movements from ''Petrushka.'' Tomorrow night at 8, 92nd Street Y, Lexington Avenue at 92nd Street. (212) 996-1100. Tickets: $20 (Kozinn).    ''MASS FOR THE 21ST CENTURY.'' Here, in excerpts, is a piece that goes even beyond Leonard Bernstein's ''Mass'' in its voracious embrace, incorporating elements of non-Christian religions to try to make a universal statement, as much political and ecological as religious. One might fear grandiosity if the composer were anyone but Carman Moore, a pragmatic, soft-spoken musician with a lively humor who has toiled quietly over the years, following his own adventurous star. It seems at least worth a try. Sunday at 3 p.m., Winter Garden, World Financial Center, West Street, south of Vesey Street, (212) 945-0505. Admission: free (Oestreich).    ''MESSIAH.'' No question, it sounds bizarre, even purposefully lunatic: Handel's oratorio staged more or less as an opera and set in Bedlam (the notorious Bethlehem Royal Hospital in London). But no one who saw Millennial Arts Productions' staging of Handel's ''Esther'' two years ago is likely to dismiss the company's effort here out of hand. That production proved both illuminating and infuriating and afforded a fine forum for the young countertenor Bejun Mehta. Here, a rotating cast of singers includes Rachel Rosales and Mark Bleeke. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30, and Sunday at 5 p.m., John Jay College Theater, 899 10th Avenue, at 59th Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-4100. Tickets: $45 (Oestreich).    NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC. In its Completely Copland Festival, the New York Philharmonic has been offering a comprehensive survey of Copland's music, with rarely heard scores played alongside old favorites and chamber concerts augmenting the orchestral programs. The young conductor Andrew Litton, who directs the Dallas Symphony Orchestra, leads the closing program, which includes the Symphony No. 1; the ''Old American Songs,'' with Marilyn Horne as the soloist; and the Symphony No. 3. A preconcert recital tonight includes performances of the Sextet, the Threnodies, Nos. 1 and 2, the Duo and Vocalise, for flute and piano, as well as a talk by the musicologist H. Wiley Hitchcock. Before tomorrow's concert there is a talk by Howard Pollack, a biographer of Copland, and performances of works for violin, piano and string quartet. Tonight and tomorrow at 8; the preconcert events are at 6:45. Avery Fisher Hall, (212) 721-6500. Tickets: $26 to $92 (Kozinn).    NEW YORK YOUTH SYMPHONY. This impressive orchestra of young musicians is playing better than ever under its current conductor, the energetic Mischa Santora. The orchestra's first concert of the new season on  Sunday at Carnegie Hall includes Mozart's ''Exultate, Jubilate'' and selected Mozart arias with the soprano Benita Valente, Elgar's ''Enigma'' Variations and the premiere of a work by David Ludwig, ''Aries.'' The Youth Symphony plays a new work by a young composer on every program. No orchestra in the country equals that kind of commitment to new music. Carnegie Hall, Sunday at 2 p.m. Tickets: $7 to $40. (212) 247-7800 (Tommasini).    SAMUEL RAMEY AND THE NEW JERSEY SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA. The bass Samuel Ramey, a down-to-earth Midwesterner, has spent a considerable part of his time portraying various operatic incarnations of the Devil. His program ''A Date With the Devil'' both celebrates and makes light of the association. He presents it again on Sunday afternoon with the New Jersey Symphony. The program includes excerpts from Boito's ''Mefistofele,'' Offenbach's ''Contes d'Hoffmann,'' Meyerbeer's ''Robert le Diable,'' Stravinsky's ''Rake's Progress'' and other works. Hal France conducts. Prudential Hall, New Jersey Performing Arts Center, One Center Street, Newark. Sunday at 3 p.m. Tickets: $12 to $56. Call: (888) GO NJPAC, (888) 466-5722), or (888) 255-3476 (Tommasini).    VIENNA CHOIR BOYS. As the millennium winds down, few musical institutions can claim to have made their mark on more than half of it. Here is one, founded in 1498 and renewed ever since. Conducted by Lucio Golino, an Italian choral specialist, the choir performs a program of international folk songs and Christmas carols and works by Austrian composers ranging from Joseph Haydn and his brother Michael to moderns: Erich Eder de Lastra and Heinz Kratochwil, both in United States premieres. Sunday at 7:30 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800. Tickets: sold out except for obstructed-view seats, $27 and $33 (Oestreich).    WAVERLY CONSORT. This venerable early music ensemble has assembled a program in which the Christmas story is told through medieval English, Spanish, French and Italian works. Sunday at 1 p.m. and 3 p.m., the Cloisters, Fort Tryon Park. (212) 650-2290. Tickets: $38; cash and check only (Kozinn).    Opera    ''DIE FLEDERMAUS,'' Amato Opera. This is the farthest remove from the New Year's production at, say, the Metropolitan Opera (which is in any case presenting only Act II this year as part of a millennium gala) or the Vienna State Opera (which is performing Lehar's ''Merry Widow''), but in general, this plucky little company fares best in frothy comedy. And a few years ago, these forces did rough, sometimes very rough, justice to this Johann Strauss confection. It is all in good humor, or most of it is, when it is not in lame humor. Tomorrow at 7:30 p.m. and Sunday at 2:30 p.m., Amato Opera Theater, 319 Bowery, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 228-8200. Tickets: $25; $20 for children and the elderly (James R. Oestreich).    ''LUCIA DI LAMMERMOOR,'' Metropolitan Opera. Experiments with Donizetti's original score earlier in the season have been set aside: this is now the classic version, with later adornments and with a distinguished cast. Ruth Ann Swenson is the mad-driven heroine, with Ramon Vargas as the man she loves and Leo Nucci the husband she kills. Edoardo Muller conducts. Metropolitan Opera, tomorrow at 12:30 p.m., (212) 362-6000. Tickets: sold out, but returns may be available. (Paul Griffiths).    ''LE NOZZE DI FIGARO,'' Metropolitan Opera. Apart from some obvious symbolism -- walls in need of a paint job standing for the crumbling of the aristocracy -- Jonathan Miller's 1998 staging of this great Mozart opera for the Met is simple, direct and attractive. The cast includes some fine singers, among them Barbara Bonney as Susanna and Susanne Mentzer as Cherubino, Ildebrando D'Arcangelo as Figaro, Bo Skovhus as the Count and Amanda Roocroft as the Countess. Tonight at 8, Metropolitan Opera, (212) 362-6000. Tickets: sold out, but returns may be available. (Allan Kozinn).    ''SUOR ANGELICA/GIANNI SCHICCHI.'' The Dicapo Opera Theater, where you can usually experience involving performances of operatic works in a wonderfully intimate setting, is back with two of the three one-act operas from Puccini's trilogy, ''Il Trittico.'' Many commentators would say they are the best of the three: ''Suor Angelica,'' with Allison Charney in the title role, and ''Gianni Schicchi,'' with Oziel Garza-Ornelas in the title role and Allison Bowman as Lauretta. Michael Recchiuti conducts, Michael Capasso directs. Dicapo Opera Theater, at St. Jean Baptiste Church, 184 East 76th Street, Manhattan. Today and tomorrow at 8 p.m. Sunday at 5 p.m. Remaining tickets are $33. Call: (212) 288-9438. (Tommasini)    ''TRISTAN UND ISOLDE,'' Metropolitan Opera. This new production has singing and orchestra playing of exceptional beauty and power together with staging marked by simplicity, dignity and intelligence. Opera has found its new Tristan and Isolde, and I wonder if we have ever had better ones. Jane Eaglen during the last few years has shown herself a brave and well-armed soldier in the Wagnerian wars, but here she is more. Beautiful sound and unflagging power are means, not ends, for this is singing subtle in its variety of deliveries, scrupulously musical and firmly in touch with the heart and soul of the role. Ben Heppner's splendid tenor is sorely pushed at but never seems to push back. The voice rides easily through the Met's big hall at quiet levels and soars above Wagner's orchestra at climactic moments. Act III's long soliloquy is painful eloquence at work. Mr. Heppner is deeply touched by Tristan's music and touches us in return. Tonight at 7, Metropolitan Opera House, (212) 362-6000. Tickets: sold out, but returns may be available. (Bernard Holland)    Dance    ALVIN AILEY AMERICAN DANCE THEATER. The company offers an unusually rich repertory of 23 works, including three premieres. Each is a choreographic journey through space, time or culture. Ronald K. Brown's ''Grace'' celebrates spiritual consciousness and the determination of people to survive despite adversity. Jawola Willa Jo Zollar looks back on growing up in the jazz world of Kansas City in ''C Sharp Street, B Flat Avenue.'' Donald McKayle explores African mythology in ''Danger Run.''

Three new works are among the highlights of a repertory season. David Rousseve's 'Somethin' From Nothin' '' was inspired by interviews with former slaves. Pedro Ruiz's ''Guajira'' is a portrait of women of the Cuban countryside. Regina Miranda's ''Avenida Brasil'' offers a kaleidoscopic look at the urban energy of Rio de Janeiro.

One of the leading musicians in the Nigerian style called fuji, Adewale Ayuba leads a group of drummers, percussionists, singers and dancers.

Extra Passenger    The Jazz Passengers with Deborah Harry, the Bottom Line, 15 West Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 228-7880. The Jazz Passengers started out playing skewed, affectionate parodies of 1960's hard-bop. The crafty wit hasn't disappeared, but the cheap laughs have given way to knotty, thoughtful compositions and, on the group's most recent album, songs about love. Deborah Harry, the blond mastermind of Blondie, appeared on that album and will join the Jazz Passengers tonight. Shows are at 7:30 and 10:30 P.M. Tickets are $15.

At 37 years old, Kevin Mahogany is a rarity in his generation: a pure jazz singer, dedicated to swing, improvisation and sensuously phrased ballads. With his deep velvet-and-smoke baritone, he sings a repertory that stretches from Duke Ellington to Milton Nascimento to obscure hard-bop tunes. He can stroll through a blues, scat-sing like a husky trombone or linger over the curves of a ballad, all with unerring pitch and thoughtful phrasing. At Sweet Basil, his quartet includes the pianist James Weidman. Tonight and tomorrow night at 9 and 11","excerpt":"Sunday at 9 and 11 P.M. There is a $15 cover and a $10 minimum.  Multi-style Saxophone    Pharoah Sanders, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, at Broadway, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3055.

Any and all of those styles are likely to figure in the course of a set with his current quartet. Tonight through Sunday night at 9 and 11. Admission is $15.  Beyond the Juke Joints    Big Jack Johnson, Chicago Blues, 73 Eighth Avenue, at 14th Street, West Village, (212) 924-9755.

My husband takes great pride in seeing his sons make the transition from street urchins to stylish young gentlemen.    But this year our 10-year-old son proclaimed the ''boring button-down look'' was not for him. Asked his fashion preference, he put on a serious face and replied: ''I want something shiny and snazzy, something that would make me look like a millionaire. I want the Regis look.''    When I asked him why, he flashed a million-dollar smile and said, ''Because I want to look like Regis Philbin, and that's my final answer.''

In ''Everything the Traffic Will Allow,'' an ebullient, anecdote-filled tribute to Ethel Merman, Ms. Blackhurst doesn't try to impersonate her idol so much as capture her spirit. With the deft support of a pop-jazz trio, she brings out a Merman trait that many overlook: her jovial sense of swing. Merman signature songs like ''I've Got Rhythm,'' ''Everything's Coming Up Roses'' and ''There's No Business Like Show Business'' are here. But so are many worthy obscurities the great star introduced. Tomorrow night at 7 and 10:30","excerpt":"Sunday night at 7. Tickets: $35; two-drink minimum.

This ageless jazz pixie with a blond pageboy haircut has found a comfortable home at Danny's. Ms. Dearie has a mere slip of a voice, but she's a stylist of remarkable subtlety who can draw out a note into a hummingbird flutter. She's a swinging pianist as well. With the tiniest adjustments in timbre and phrasing, she conveys an understated mixture of wistfulness, wisdom and dry humor, capturing the fey, ironic joie de vivre of someone at once canny and eternally youthful in spirit. Her flirtatious ''I Won't Dance,'' among other numbers, is close to definitive. Tonight and tomorrow night at 11","excerpt":"Sunday night at 8:30. Cover: $15; minimum, $15.

Ms. Allyson is young enough to have fallen in love with 1970's singer-songwriters like Joni Mitchell, Elton John and Carly Simon while growing up, and sophisticated enough to envision their songs in a pop-jazz continuum that goes far beyond the soft-rock genre they helped define. It is a concept that others have toyed with, but no one has carried as far or realized as successfully as this jazz singer, who is performing with a quartet (Bruce Barth on piano, Danny Embrey on guitar, Bob Bowman on bass, and Todd Strait on drums). She sings from wised-up but far from jaded perspective of a woman who knows the score but keeps her chin up. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8 and 10","excerpt":"Sunday night at 8.

Does the phone company still use or issue exchange letters (like BUtterfield 8) to identify telephone number prefixes? And if so, is there any way to get a list of all the telephone exchange letters and their corresponding areas in New York City?  A. The answer to your first question is: 66. (That's NO.)   Telephone exchange letters, once a source of pride (and sometimes snobbery) among the city's callers, finally went the way of the dodo in the middle to late 1970's, said Dave Frail, spokesman for Nynex. But it wasn't without some squawking.    The demise of the letters, which paid tribute to streets and neighborhoods as well as prominent families and historic figures, began in 1960.    In 1960, Fredrick R. Kappel took over as the C.E.O. of AT&T (the 236 of 288) and decided to switch to an all-number system to ease direct dialing and directory information, according to \\"Telephone,\\" a history of the phone, by John Brooks (Harper and Row, 1975).    Early experiments with all-numbered prefixes in Council Bluffs, Iowa, went just fine. The trouble began when AT&T started to try to take away the letters in bigger cities. In San Francisco, phone users were so outraged they formed the Anti-Digit Dialing League and filed lawsuits to prevent the change (people really liked their letters). An October 1962 editorial in The New York Times in support of the league noted disdainfully that AT&T \\"wants nothing but numbers, just numbers -- digits, just digits.\\"   By the end of 1962, AT&T had a public relations fiasco on its hands and slowed down the plan to change the system, issuing all-number numbers to new customers only. Thus, letter exchanges were still being listed in city phone books as late as the late 1970's. (BUtterfield 8, made famous by the 1935 John O'Hara novel and the 1960 Elizabeth Taylor film, referred to numbers in a stylish area on the Upper East Side.)    Though less present in the lexicon now, the exchanges are still used by some New Yorkers. No current maps or listings exist, Mr. Frail said, but if you check the front of any phone book before the change (available on microfiche at the New York Public Library) , you can find a list of the lost letters.

Ugh, we thought, what could be worse than mall sushi? But what could be better, if it's made at Yanagi? Set among the pizza and sandwich stands at the food court of New Jersey's first mall, Yanagi does the run of Japanese food, but it outdoes itself in sushi. Yanagi's sushi chefs are speedier than most, as they would have to be in Food Court Land, but their preparations do not suffer for it. I'm partial to the octopus roll with hot and spicy soy dressing ($2.82) and the eel roll ($3.07). My wife, remembering our year-of-much-sushi on the West Coast, is a fan of the avocado-stuffed California roll ($2.82), while my young daughters go for the more traditional salmon ($3.07) or tuna ($2.82).

It's a hefty slab of Shakespeare: all three parts of ''Henry VI,'' trimmed of fat and put through a meat grinder, then garnished with generous doses of directorial panache. A freshly sharpened cleaver is the weapon of choice in Edward Hall's flashy, eminently accessible production, which presents 15th-century England as a slaughterhouse doing big business. The three plays are compressed into less than four hours of stage time. (With a generous dinner break and two intermissions, ''Rose Rage'' requires about five and a half hours.) The overriding metaphor, equating war with butchery, is manifested in various arresting ways. A cleaver snaps down on a jiggling pile of organ meat, signifying the fated end of an earl. Globs of flesh drip from plastic bags flung up on meat hooks. Red cabbages, symbolizing traitorous heads, are splintered beneath wooden clubs. But metaphors are by their nature limiting, and Mr. Hall's has worn a bit thin by the end of the long evening. More problematic: Characters emerge only in broad outline here, and a real sense of humanity is largely missing from the production (5:30).

Broadway    ++ ''ANNA IN THE TROPICS.'' That slowly rotating ceiling fan isn't the only thing stirring the air in Nilo Cruz's earnestly poetic play, which won this year's Pulitzer Prize for drama. Every breath seems to emerge as a sigh, every word as a longing for the unobtainable. In evoking the lost Cuban-American world of a Florida cigar factory in 1929, Mr. Cruz has created a work as wistful and affectingly ambitious as its characters. ''Anna in the Tropics'' reaches for that corner of artistic eternity occupied by Chekhov's plays of yearning. But while there's warmth and sincerity in the performances, especially those of Jimmy Smits and Daphne Rubin-Vega as adulterous lovers, Emily Mann's straightforward staging does not show off Mr. Cruz's sometimes clumsy lyricism to its best advantage. Like the romance-drunk souls who inhabit it, ''Anna'' ultimately finds that its reach exceeds its grasp (2:20). Royale Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200.

Broadway    *  ''ELAINE STRITCH AT LIBERTY.'' Ethel Merman wrote of the star of this remarkable one-woman show, ''Stritch's glands work overtime.'' And the director, George C. Wolfe, has provided a luxuriously minimal production that makes no attempt to compete with such industrious glands. A collage of song and reminiscence from the most enduring of musical comedy veterans, assembled by Ms. Stritch and John Lahr, the show is nothing like the concerts in the manner of the aging Marlene Dietrich mummified in sequined splendor. Ms. Stritch's glamour comes from her timing, her solar energy and a voice that makes gravel seem like Carrara marble. Reanimating several decades of her personally embossed showstoppers, from ''Zip'' to ''The Ladies Who Lunch,'' Ms. Stritch turns ''At Liberty'' into a one-woman testimony to the vitality that once made the Broadway musical the liveliest of the American arts (2:40).

Wednesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.","excerpt":"Sundays at 5 p.m. Tickets: $40 to $85, with a limited number of $25 student rush tickets at the box office on the day of the performance (Ben Brantley).    ''FORTUNE'S FOOL.'' Oh, what a lovely bore Alan Bates turns out to be in the Broadway premiere of Ivan Turgenev's 19th-century comedy. Playing a shabby, self-effacing aristocrat in provincial Russia, Mr. Bates turns one sad fellow's humiliating moment of drunkenness into a triumph of timing, technique and continuously startling insights. This blissfully staged dinner-party scene accounts for about 15 minutes of ''Fortune's Fool,'' directed by Arthur Penn from Mike Poulton's adaptation, and it's a spectacle that no lover of acting should miss. While Frank Langella is deliciously overripe as a poisonous fop, none of the other actors rise to the heightened verisimilitude of the show's two stars. This gives the production a wobbly quality, as if it were walking on one neatly fitted high-heel boot and one very flat bare foot (2:20). Music Box, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $56.25 and $76.25 (Brantley).    ''THE GRADUATE.'' Broadway's answer to the Tonya Harding-Paula Jones boxing match. Inspired by Mike Nichols's benchmark movie and the cult novel by Charles Webb, this leering, undercooked show is the most cynical specimen of the theater's current vogue for cannibalizing Hollywood classics. The show trafficks easily and cheaply in memories of the movie and the Q ratings of its stars, Kathleen Turner (as the lascivious Mrs. Robinson), Alicia Silverstone (as her virginal daughter) and Jason Biggs (in the title role originated on screen by Dustin Hoffman). Nearly everything seems as flat and two-dimensional as construction paper, as if this were The Graduate: The Board Game. Only Ms. Turner, who has a much ballyhooed 20-second nude scene, is at all fun to watch(2:15). Plymouth, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $41.25 to $76.25 (Brantley).    *''METAMORPHOSES.'' When Mary Zimmerman's dreamlike adaptation of Ovid's tales opened in the fall, it was less than a month after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, and the show's ritualistic portrayal of love, death and transformation somehow seemed to flow directly from the collective unconscious of a stunned city. The lore of theater, like that of Ovid, has its own cruel tales of transmutation, of little shows that got lost in big palaces, and there was anxious speculation on how ''Metamorphoses'' might translate in a Broadway setting. Well, as a line from the production has it, ''The gods are not altogether unkind.'' The Circle in the Square's configuration, with its evocation of Greek and Roman amphitheaters, turns out to be an ideal environment for a work that emphasizes the value of shared cultural myths. The magic of ''Metamorphoses'' has been, if anything, enhanced, its gift for subliminal seduction magnified (1:30). Circle in the Square, 254 West 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $75; a limited number of $35 tickets are available at the box office on the day of the performance (Brantley).    ''OKLAHOMA!'' In a freshly reconceived version of this most classic of American musicals, the director Trevor Nunn and the choreographer Susan Stroman find rushing erotic currents in the frontier spirit. At its best, which is usually when it's dancing, this resurrection of Rodgers and Hammerstein's epochal show is dewy with an adolescent lustiness, both carnal and na&#239;ve, exuberant and confused. This was the sensibility that made an old show seem newborn when Mr. Nunn and Ms. Stroman first staged their ''Oklahoma!'' four years ago in London. In its belated, recast New York incarnation, the show has yet to achieve that same compelling fluidity, but it retains considerable charm. Patrick Wilson and Josefina Gabrielle are amiable if lukewarm as sparring prairie lovebirds, and the superb Shuler Henlsey stomps away with the show as the surly Jud Frye (2:55). Gershwin, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m. Tickets: $20 to $95 (Brantley).    *  ''TOPDOG/UNDERDOG.'' This year's Pultizer Prize winner vibrates with the clamor of big ideas, audaciously and exuberantly expressed. Like Ralph Ellison's ''Invisible Man,'' Suzan-Lori Parks's thrilling comic drama considers the existential traps of being African-American and male in the United States, the masks that wear the men as well as vice versa. But don't think Ms. Parks is delivering a lecture. Under the bravura direction of George C. Wolfe, who understands that showmanship and substance are not mutually exclusive, ''Topdog'' is a deeply theatrical experience. This electrifyingly acted portrait of con-artist brothers, portentously named Lincoln (Jeffrey Wright) and Booth (Mos Def), is all about poses and pretenses, large and small, that somehow take you closer to the truth. Tighter and tenser than it was Off Broadway last year, ''Topdog'' now emerges as the most exciting home-grown play to hit Broadway since Tony Kushner's ''Angels in America,'' while the astonishing Mr. Wright turns in the season's most intricately layered performance (2:15). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $35-75, with a limited number of $15 tickets at the box office on the day of the performance(Brantley).    Off Broadway    * ''ANDORRA.'' Few other works of literature explore the outrage and folly of collective hatred with such terrifying sobriety as this rarely revived 1961 work by the Swiss playwright Max Frisch. Set in a fictional nation that recalls the playwright's native Switzerland, the story focuses on an adopted boy, supposedly a Jew, who becomes a societal mirror when his true identity is revealed after 20 years. It is a first-rank play, and this calculatedly unspectacular but cogent and gripping production, directed by Liviu Ciulei, makes you wonder most of all why it is not presented with regularity (2:45). Lucille Lortell Theater, 121 Christopher Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 7:30 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 7:30 p.m.; Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $55, with $10 student rush tickets available at the box office one hour before the show. (Bruce Weber).    ''THE GOLEM.'' Placing your hopes for survival in a lump of clay is a wish of last resort, born of either rage or faith. In Prague in the late 16th century, the Maharal, or rabbi, made just such a wish, fashioning a living tool of retribution out of earth and water and sending it forth to defy the city's vicious anti-Semites and defend the Jews. Such is the legend, dramatized in H. Leivick's play, among whose themes is that faith and rage can be dangerously difficult to tell apart. As Israelis and Palestinians persist in their agonizing war, it is painfully apparent that the play's themes remain current. And its awful conclusion, its depiction of vengeance turning tragically back upon the avenger, has everything to say about the perpetual cycle of violence that is stripping Jerusalem and its environs of their holiness and humanity. This production, directed by Lawrence Sacharow and starring Robert Prosky, makes its contemporary relevance felt but falls short of its possibilities; it doesn't freeze the blood or rumble with a harbinger of apocalypse (2:00). Manhattan Ensemble Theater, 55 Mercer Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays and Wednesdays at 7 p.m.; Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $55, with a limited number of $15 student rush tickets available at the box office 30 minutes before the performance (Weber).    * ''THE UNDERPANTS.'' Steve Martin's adaptation of Carl Sternheim's 1910 farcical send-up of the German bourgeoisie takes its distinctive tone from its combination of narrative literature and sketch comedy. The story is about the frenzy caused when a pretty young woman's bloomers assume a life of their own, and Mr. Martin's bold aspiration for it is literary slapstick. Proudly short on subtlety, uncautiously thick with jokes that range from potty humor to snickery schoolboy irreverence to agile, even erudite wordplay, the show will appeal most to theatergoers with a broad taste in humor. Mr. Martin; the director, Barry Edelstein; and a very game cast appear to be completely unafraid of clinkers. The show rolls right over them. In any case, despite the misses, ''The Underpants'' is often laugh-out-loud funny and unlike anything else in New York (1:30). Classic Stage Company, 136 East 13th Street, (212) 677-4210. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. No matinee this Saturday. Tickets: $35. A limited number of pay-what-you-can tickets for those under 18; a $25 Quicktix available one hour before the show (Weber).    Last Chance    * ''FRANNY'S WAY.'' Boundaries warp and melt in the dense urban heat that pervades Richard Nelson's sensitively drawn portrait of love in the age of J. D. Salinger. The lines between childhood and adulthood blur disorientingly for the three generations of characters gathered in a cramped apartment in Greenwich Village at the height of summer in the 1950's. Directed by its author, the play reaffirms Mr. Nelson's distinctive gifts as a creator of memory plays that sting. Though the play is overpacked with plot for its 90-minute length and its backward-looking structure feels a tad musty, Mr. Nelson and his cast resist melodrama, trading instead on the accumulation of small tensions of people in crisis who pretend that things are as usual. Kathleen Widdoes and Elisabeth Moss are the older and younger versions of the title character(1:30). Atlantic Theater Company, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 3 and 7:30 p.m. Tickets: $45 (Brantley).     ''HELEN.'' It must be gratifying for Donna Murphy, who became a Broadway star as the homely heroine of Stephen Sondheim's ''Passion,'' to be playing the most gorgeous woman in history. And the role of Helen of Troy does indeed seem to fit her snugly in Ellen McLaughlin's new play, directed by Tony Kushner. Yet Ms. Murphy doesn't have much chance to be more than arch in this gloss on the Euripides classic of the same title. Though luxuriously mounted with a top-notch cast that includes Denis O'Hare, Phylicia Rashad and Marian Seldes, ''Helen'' feels more like annotation than interpretation, a precocious class project for a seminar called ''The Ancient Greeks: Why They Matter Today.'' Its only sense of movement comes from its juggling of anachronisms. Like its heroine, the show just sits there, looking beautiful and passive (2:00). Joseph Papp Public Theater, Martinson Hall, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200. Tonight at 8 p.m.; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 2 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $45 (Brantley).    ''WHAT THE HELL'S YOUR PROBLEM?'' Tom Noonan's new play recreates a New Age-style therapy meeting, taking place in a brightly lighted room, with theatergoers in chairs arranged around a central podium as if taking part in a seminar. No, another psychobabble parody isn't the most promising idea, but the illusion works. The show, which is scripted only to a point, does end up including the audience in its illusion, and though the impulse to behave as if we are not theatergoers but seminar attendees may be ultimately resistible, it is unsettlingly genuine (1:50). Paradise Theater, 64 East Fourth Street, (212) 206-1515. tonight at 7:30 and 10 p.m.; tomorrow at 7:30 and 10 p.m.; Sunday at 5 p.m. Tickets: $25 (Weber).

GREENE STREET, #101-103 Greene Street (925-2415) -    * (Jan. 23, 1981) Dining and music would seem to be a natural partnership and yet, if you discount piped-in background music or disco, there is a dearth of places to eat well that also have live music. Greene Street, which offers American and classic cuisine in a handsome SoHo setting of soaring, arched brick walls and potted trees, also presents jazz performers nightly, usually piano and bass. Some appetizer choices are smoked quail with shiitake mushrooms, salmon sausage with herb sauce or vegetable tart. Entrees include salmon fillet with three caviars, ecalope of veal with a chive cream sauce and marinated roast loin of lamb. Entrees $15.75 to $22.50.

The fare at this Greenwich Village restaurant is straightforward and the Oriental ambiance is somewhat faded. The kitchen's strong suit is broiling, not frying, and the sweet dishes are extremely sweet.

The theme of this scintillating show is the continuing impact on fashion of the elegant, extravagant 18th century, when aristocratic taste prevailed and luxury knew no bounds. Even in our minimalist modern age, a yearning for unabashed finery keeps breaking out, the show proposes, and it compares some magnificent examples of 18th-century style with 19th- and 20th-century counterparts. Echoes of the wasp waist, buttressed busts with deep decolletage, flaring hips and elaborate surface adornment beloved by the 18th century reappear in the 19th in a gown made by Elise, dressmaker to the  Princess of Wales, for example, and in the 20th century in clothes by designers like Worth, Lanvin, Christian Lacroix, Hubert de Givenchy and Karl Lagerfeld for Chanel. The examples, from the Met's collection, are strikingly handsome, and the presentation has panache. Hours: Fridays and Saturdays, 9:30 A.M. to 8:45 P.M.","excerpt":"Sundays, and Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 A.M. to 5:15 P.M. Admission: $8; $4 for students and the elderly (Grace Glueck). ART GUIDE"},{"year":"1984","title":"Following is a summary of reviews of restaurants that have appeared in The New York Times. Stars are followed by the date of original publication. Prices are current, and only weekend hours are given.   BOMBAY PALACE, 30 West 52d Street (541-7777) - vv (Sept. 30, 1983). A handsome and spacious red dining room for the mildly spiced specialties of northern India. Tandoori dishes are the mainstays although, except for the delicate ground-lamb seekh kebab, they tend to be dry. There are savory braised lamb and beef dishes, the best being gosht patiala, boneless chunks of lamb simmered with onion, ginger, garlic and yogurt. Soups are better than appetizers, and nan is the best bread. Desserts other than mango ice cream are skippable. Entrees average $16.

If the home team loses on Sunday, studies show, then on Monday workers' productivity plummets and everyone gets depressed. If the team wins, business soars and taverns fill up. This link between a city's psyche and the fate of its football players may seem strange to those not swept up by National Football League delirium.

We may have a smattering of knowledge about tea ceremonies, shoguns, banyan trees, flower arrangements, Sony and the samurai warriors, but our exploration of Japanese civilization has not extended much beyond that.   Not indifferent to this notion and to the fact that there is a growing number of Japanese residents living on the Island, especially in the Great Neck area, a group of Long Islanders, both Americans and Japanese, decided to do something about familiarizing Americans with Japanese civilization and with the Japanese residing in their communities.   The result was an ambitiously extensive project, ''Japan in Great Neck,'' which includes from now through November events as varied as lectures, films and demonstrations on Japanese musical instruments, dance, literature and drama, doll making, religion and philosophy and flower arranging - as well as one Japanese contribution greatly admired by many Americans, the art of Japanese business. Financed by the National Endowment for the Humanities through a grant to the New York State Library, the programs are to be held in the community room of the Great Neck Library.

One brewer's T-shirt posed the question, \\"If You Can't Taste It, Why Bother?\\" Another admonished, \\"Life's Too Short To Drink Cheap Beer.\\" It was certainly too short to drink all the beer here. At this, the 10th anniversary of the festival, about 7,000 people spent two nights sampling more than 500 beers from 159 breweries ranging from Anheuser-Busch to New Belgium (a tart, yeasty Trappist ale hand-bottled in a Fort Collins, Colo., basement).   The crowd consisted of homebrewers, their palates already seasoned by strange concoctions of their own, and the curious, who had come to expand their idea of what makes beer beer. Despite the presence of national breweries, the event, run by the Association of Brewers, based in Boulder, Colo., is best known for fraternal atmosphere among \\"microbrewers,\\" \\"craft brewers\\" or (the word makes most of them wince) \\"boutique\\" brewers. Whatever you call them, they are all individual, independent small makers of beer.   Charlie Papazian, president of the American Homebrewers Association, who weaned many microbrewers with his 1982 manual, \\"The Complete Joy of Homebrewing\\" (Avon Books), extended his hand toward hundreds of besieged tap handles.   \\"Go to Germany, Belgium, anywhere,\\" he said, a copy of his book tucked into the back of his trousers. \\"I don't think there's a country in the world with this kind of selection. That's what this festival is about -- education. You can't get any closer to a beer than having it poured by someone from the brewery and asking them nitty-gritty questions.\\"   Ask any one of the brewers serving beer about the movement to brew traditional, unadulterated beer and you will be told that a century ago there were over 4,000 regional breweries in the United States. Prohibition killed off half of them","excerpt":"superhighways and advertising made light, watery national lagers feasible and fashionable. The legalization of homebrewing in 1978 helped to inspire a new beer culture. At the last count taken by the Institute for Brewing Studies, based in Boulder, there were 238 microbreweries in the United States, most of them in the West, where laws are less restrictive.   The Great American Beer Festival is where the homebrewers-turned-microbrewers come to taste, trade notes, party and prostelytize, to bask in their accomplishments. And if all this fervor is on behalf of an estimated one-tenth of 1 percent of the American market that buys the microbrews, who was counting?   Last Wednesday and Thursday, 26 experts gathered at 9 A.M. to judge 31 different styles in blind tastings -- from fruit and herb beers to full-bodied stouts. The process was not as ebullient as one might imagine. The experts swirled the beer and scrutinized the color, head and carbonation. They pondered in silence, scribbled, sniffed and finally tasted. (Unlike wine tasters, they did not spit -- how a beer goes down is of paramount importance.)   They worked on a kind of negative trajectory, in which beers were cast off one by one for taste defects or for not conforming to a standard style. \\"I really want to say it smells like my workboots,\\" said Phil Moeller of the Rubicon Brewing Company of Sacramento as he sniffed a light lager. Perhaps he was slightly peeved that its brewery would sell more beer in a day than he would in a lifetime.   Down the hall, 33 stouts had judges sweating out fine points. \\"Did you get any bacon fat on 98?\\" one asked.   \\"There's nothing wrong with a little smoke in this category,\\" said another.   \\"Maybe if you served it with eggs.\\"   \\"There's nice roast but a touch of rubber. Are you getting rubber?\\"   \\"Ninety-six, I got warm milk, clean malt, no bitterness.\\"   The winners weren't announced until Saturday, when the brewers left their tasting tables to gather around the lectern. As soon as she heard the words \\"From Eugene . . . , \\" Teri Fahrendorf of the Steelhead Brewery in Eugene, Ore., tapped her cousin and whispered, \\"That's me!\\" She mounted the stage with the tipsy dignity of Lucille Ball to collect a gold medal for her Scotch ale.   She had hardly returned to the crowd before her name was announced again as the winner of the richly competitive stout category, and while she was telling an admirer that yes, there are other female brewmasters, Carol Stoudt from Stoudt's Brewery in Adamstown, Pa., won a medal for her Doppelbock, a heavy, malt-accented lager.   Ms. Fahrendorf was asked why so few women were brewers. \\"Society still doesn't encourage little girls to be what they want to be,\\" she said. She added that she hadn't ever been much of a beer drinker, but had a peculiar gift for handling yeast.   The \\"bacon-fat\\" stout, which won a silver medal, turned out to be from the Appleton Brewing Company in Appleton, Wis. Its owner and brewmaster, John Jungers, sold his rustproofing business to open his restaurant-brewpub. He won four other medals for his pilsener, helles, bock and amber beers.   You can't taste Mr. Junger's beers unless you visit his place, however. This is the nature of microbrewing, which tends to limit its distribution to a 200-mile radius. \\"People don't want national,\\" said C. R. Saikley, an associate editor of the monthly West Coast \\"brewspaper,\\" the Celebrator. \\"Part of the appeal is becoming thirsty for beers in other regions and then traveling to find them.\\"   The festival director, Daniel Bradford, says he wants people to embrace the \\"entire beer family.\\" Much of the money for the festival comes from large brewers. Anheuser-Busch donates storage space and refrigeration; Coors helps with transportation of beer, and Miller underwrites an anti-intoxication campaign that provides free cab rides home.   In return, the festival has devised categories for what most brewers consider degraded styles: light beer, dry beer and malt liquor. Pabst took home two gold medals -- although the fellow at the Pabst table was the loneliest person in the hall. Of course, people can drink Pabst anywhere; where can they drink chili beer, potato beer, orange-cardomom beer?   \\"Indigenous beers, beers with a regional character -- that's the renaissance we're all immersed in,\\" said Geoff Larson of Alaskan Brewing, \\"We had to turn to Europe for our first inspiration, but now we're turning back to America.\\" At a Festival, Every Beer's The Right One"},{"year":"1971","title":"nearly 20-million Itals begin annual summer exodus","excerpt":"superhighways jammed with traffic 20 Million Italians Take to the Roads For August Holiday"},{"year":"1951","title":"White, Anne FATH SKIRTS SHOW FURLED FULLNESS","excerpt":"Superimposed Layers Mark New Style--Griffe Features Simple, Wearable Clothes Discreet Prints Contrasting Fullness"},{"year":"1993","title":"For some time Noam Chomsky, the linguist, author, political activist and outspoken critic of what he sees to be the American power elite, has survived attacks by critics of his radically independent thinking.
