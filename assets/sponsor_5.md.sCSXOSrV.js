Both last and least were businessmen, whom the Chinese philosopher considered exploiters of other people.   Confucius created no separate category for lawyers, though in our era of lawyers-as-businessmen, their niche is arguably clear. But by her good deeds Ms. Chee has exemplified the Confucian ideal.

The inevitable rumors about Mr. Brinkley's motivations included everything from his health to his unhappiness about not being offered a prominent spot on the nightly news when John Chancellor is replaced by Roger Mudd and Tom Brokaw next spring. Mr. Brinkley and the network would say only that the parting was relatively amicable, reflecting his desire for a change, although he had been professing publicly that he thoroughly enjoyed his assignment as host of the weekly ''NBC Magazine.''   In any event, Mr. Brinkley soon signed a contract with ABC News, in the process neatly dispelling those health rumors.

No reason to.   He woke beside his wife in their home in North Augusta, S.C., felt the ache in his left leg that has never left him for a single day over this half-century and prepared for work as a state supervisor of job trainees. - \\"Sometimes, when people know that I had pitched in the major leagues, and see I have some trouble gettin' around, they ask if I injured my knee playin' ball,\\" he said yesterday by telephone. \\"I tell 'em, 'Well, no, it was a little something I got in the service, and that's it.' \\"   Brissie, now 70 years old, his hair thinning, still big at 6 feet 4 1/2 inches and still looking fit, can walk unaided, though with a slight limp, for short distances. Otherwise, he must rely on a cane or crutches.   And he remembers: It was on Dec. 7, 1944, in the Apennines in central Italy as American soldiers moved up against German positions, that an advance echelon, with the 20-year-old Corporal Brissie, got into trouble.   \\"They unloaded everything on us,\\" he recalled. \\"The shell that hit me killed 11 men. I was the closest when it exploded, but I got mine mostly in the legs. The others were hit mostly in the throat and the head.\\"   Brissie crawled to a creek, where he hoped to get some protection, and passed out. He was left for dead until one medic carried him off. In the Army hospital in Naples, a doctor said he must amputate his left leg.   \\"Doc, you can't!\\" said Brissie. \\"I'm a ballplayer. You have to try to find another way.\\"   Before entering the military, Brissie had been a promising left-handed high school and then freshman college pitcher at Presbyterian in South Carolina. Connie Mack, manager of the Philadelphia A's, wrote him while he was in service and promised him a tryout on his return.   The army surgeon, Dr. William Brubaker, who would become a lifelong friend of Brissie's, found a way to save the leg. Brissie was the first person in the Mediterranean theater to be given the new drug penicillin, and Brissie underwent surgery -- the first of 23 operations on his leg -- in which 30 bone fragments and 5 1/2 inches of skin bone were removed.   Now began an amazing story, beginning with his return on a stretcher to America to his wife and infant daughter, seeking to regain his health and use of his leg in veterans hospitals and never forgetting his dream of pitching in the big leagues, though often being told by doctors: \\"You must understand your limitations, young man. Think about other things you can do.\\"   Brissie began throwing a baseball on crutches. He was soon free of them. He hooked up with a sandlot team in 1946, wore a bulky aluminum brace that was made to protect his leg but drew stares, went through tearful disappointments, then adjusted his pitching stride and learned how to field bunts. He joined the Savannah Class AA ball club and began winning games. In 1947, he was called up to the A's. \\"It took my breath away,\\" he recalled.   On opening day of 1948, he started against the Red Sox. In the sixth inning, Ted Williams hit a line drive off his leg brace. It made a clanging noise heard throughout the ball park. Brissie collapsed. Williams ran from first base to the mound. \\"Are you all right?\\" he asked. Brissie looked up from the ground. \\"Why don't you pull the damn ball?\\" he said. They both laughed.   Brissie, despite battling infections and pain, became a standout pitcher, making the American League All-Star team in 1949. He was traded to Cleveland in 1951 and retired from baseball two years later, refusing to be sent back to the minor leagues.   \\"I knew I was a symbol to many veterans trying to overcome problems,\\" he said. \\"I wasn't going to let them down.\\"   Today, Brissie says he identifies in a manner with Jim Abbott, the Yankees' one-handed pitcher. \\"He was innovative, and it seemed, like me, he never thought of failing.\\" Brissie is also distressed about the baseball strike. \\"There's not going to be a winner. That's the tragedy.\\"   Last summer, for the first time in nearly 50 years, Lou Brissie returned to Italy, visiting military cemeteries at Anzio and other sites.   \\"I found a lot of old friends there, and thought about those times,\\" he said. He paused for a moment. \\"I didn't handle it as well as I thought I would.\\" Sports of The Times: Baseball","excerpt":"Brissie Never Thought of Failure"},{"year":"1949","title":"PHILADELPHIA, May 22 (AP) -- The Athletics captured both ends of a double-header from the Indians today for the first time since 1945.
