He suggested that if she could get rid of the child she was welcome to return home.The whole story hinges on Fred Williams, a private in the American Expeditionary Force, and Mary, the iron master's daughter, being married in a small town in France, the ceremony having been performed by an imposter, a deserter masquerading in a clergyman's uniform. Fred is called to the firing line the morning after their supposed marriage, and a little later Mary learns that the supposed parson is under arrest.Fred volunteers to go over the top on a hazardous mission, and having heard from Mary about the man who officiated at their marriage, he decides to try and make his way to the French town and have the ceremony performed again. Nothing is heard of him for years afterward, and the climax is arranged through reliance on amnesia.There are four war buddies in this narrative. They are known as Fred Williams, \\"Mike\\" Ginsburg, \\"Peaceful\\" Perkins and Corporal Fogarty. Soon after their arrival in France announcement is made that there is to be a big show, and this time it refers to an amateur stage entertainment. Fred is asked to impersonate one of the \\"Florodora Sextette,\\" and before his turn comes to appear a \\"real back-home\\" girl is announced. She turns out to be Mary Phillips, who, according to a title, came to France to entertain thousands of soldiers, but ended up my entertaining only one—Fred.Some conception of the character of this film can be gained from the captions. When Mary goes to live with Fred's mother after being scowled at by her father, one reads:\\"The sanctuary of an understanding heart.\\"The iron master's sister is with him when the Unknown Soldier procession is passing. She urges her brother as follows:\\"John, this is a good time to forget the past and bring Mary back home.\\"When Mary is told that her child is not wanted under her father's roof, she says:\\"Do you mean it? If you don't want him, you don't want me.\\"The Deity is frequently brought into the titles and in the closing chapter a priest signifies his willingness to marry Mary to an invisible husband. During these latter sequences there is a strenuous effort to show the marvelous faith of the heroine.Charles E. Mack is sincere as Fred Williams. Marguerite de la Motte gives a creditable performance as Mary. The flint-hearted iron master's rôle is handled by Henry B. Walthall, who, during several scenes, looks like a tragedian of old, with frowns and sneers.

There have been so many others, in Zurich, in Leyden, here and there. It matters only that the victim was an Israeli. Although the reader spends time in Bonn and in Tel Aviv and in Vienna, Munich, Mykonos, London, it matters hardly at all, except that the ambiance of these places is an invitation for Mr. le Carre to use his palette. The places are simply where the terrorist strikes, or where the antiterrorists are collected.   It becomes instantly apparent that we are in the hands of a writer of great powers.

And looking at his sculptures and paintings in the show titled \\"A Tribute to David Hare\\" at the New York Studio School, one begins to see why. They are the work of an intelligent, purposeful, highly literate artist, but one who somehow got left behind in time, frozen in a style that many of his colleagues moved beyond.   Originally a photographer, Hare began making figurative sculpture in the early 1940's when European Surrealist art struck him with the force of a revelation. This watershed moment, however, coincided with the rise of Abstract Expressionism, a movement that established painting as the privileged international medium. (Hare himself didn't start to paint until the late 50's.) It also came at a time when many of his most adventurous New York colleagues were taking the plunge into pure abstraction. Hare didn't follow their lead. His devotion to Surrealism -- with its psychological preoccupations and its interest in fantasy and myth -- was complete, and would remain so for the rest of his life.

The co-founder of Akamai Technologies, murdered on September 11th aboard American Airlines flight 11 which crashed in New York City. A resident of the Boston area, 31 years of age, Danny was born to be a leader and an inspiration to all he met. In a tragically short life, he excelled in each and every one of his endeavors, whether it be as a distinguished soldier, student, scientist, business figure and family man. With a multitude of interests, and a larger than life presence, Danny's passion, brilliant mind and warm smile were only some of his endearing qualities. Dedicated to his family, Danny possessed a unique ability to balance both the daily demands of academia and the workplace, with a constant flow of affection for his wife and children. While his accomplishments began to grow, along with his circle of friends, his modesty remained intact. He founded Akamai Technologies, in 1998, with his professor F. Tom Leighton and fellow graduate student, Jonathan Seelig. In a short time, and under Danny's harddriving leadership and vision, Akamai grew to be one of the top technology companies in the world. As chief technology officer, he was responsible for Akamai's research and development strategy, creating innovative Internet infrastructure services that would produce an entirely new industry segment, & forever change the way people and companies distribute content, data, and applications. Akamai's 1,100 employees and global customer base will miss him dearly. Born in Denver, Colorado, Danny immigrated to Israel with his family in 1984. Upon completing public high school, ORT, in Jerusalem, Danny served for four years in the Israel Defense Forces. He rose to the rank of captain in what is considered the Army's most elite unit. Following his active military service, Danny was married in Jerusalem and began his studies at the Technion, Israel's premier technology university. Soon after, Danny worked at IBM's research laboratory in Haifa, where he was a full-time research fellow and project leader while simultaneously completing two undergraduate degrees, computer science and mathematics summa cum laude, and celebrating the birth of his first son. In 1995, the Technion named him the year's Outstanding Student in Computer Engineering. At IBM, he was responsible for the development and support of the company's Genesys system, a processor verification tool that is used widely within IBM and in other companies such as AMD & SGS Thompson. In 1996, Danny and his wife, Anne, welcomed their second son and moved to Cambridge, Mass. where he received a scholarship to study at MIT under the tutelage of MIT Professor, and soon to become close friend, Tom Leighton. He published and presented several breakthrough papers at top computer science conferences and received several awards, including the 1998 Morris Joseph Lewin Award for Best Masterworks Thesis Presentation at MIT. His Master's thesis included some of the fundamental algorithms that make up the core of Akamai's services. He received a Master's degree from MIT in 1997 and was a Ph.D. candidate in the Algorithms groups at MIT's Laboratory for Computer Science upon his death. His embrace of risk, and affinity for speed and freedom, was also demonstrated by his personal pursuits: motorcycles, sports cars, and skiing. His love of country and appreciation for culture was shown in his early training in classical music and his knowledge of Israel's politics and history. In addition to his many friends and colleagues, he is survived by a close-knit family. Danny was a devoted husband to Anne, his companion throughout adulthood, a fellow immigrant to Israel, and a student and teacher of art and literature","excerpt":"a loving father to sons Eitan and Itamar; loyal son of Drs.

To those who have vacationed on Florida's Atlantic coast, this affluent resort community that swells to 33,000 in peak season may seem an oddity.  The fine sand, like confectioner's sugar, is the first thing one notices. Its origins are somewhat less than romantic, however, the waste produced by coral-eating fish having played a prominent role. Then too, the Everglades are close at hand -- a 40-minute drive -- giving Naples that clearing-on-the-edge-of-the-backwoods feel, particularly if one approaches from Alligator Alley, the highway crossing the state from Fort Lauderdale.

Nonetheless, smart shoppers can still unearth treasures of substance -- a bright October-weight pea jacket at a lottery-low price, a luscious cashmere cardigan with crystal buttons, even a pleasingly heavy 22-karat gold pendant on a leather necklace -- all for less than $100. Here are 10 of the season's best buys that still have the power to surprise.    1. For a quick hit of designer cachet, Prada's mirrored powder compact is filled with silky face powder and fits neatly into a buttery soft blush-hued leather case ($50 at www.neimanmarcus.com).    2. Shanghai Tang's navy umbrella is lined in pink and white clouds, opens at the touch of a button, snaps shut with a silver clasp and puts luxury at your fingertips ($65 at Shanghai Tang in New York, 212-888-0111).    3. Private label Aqua cashmere cardigans by Bloomingdale's come in blue, gray or black and have three-quarter-length sleeves and a row of sparkling crystal buttons ($99 at Bloomingdale's stores).    4.

A rich brocade paisley shawl by Roberta Freymann comes in golden mint or plummy sienna and is rimmed with fur pompoms ($85 at Roberta Freymann in New York, 212-585-3767).    6. Good Charma makes extravagance accessible in the form of a deliciously weighty Buddha pendant that is made of 22-carat gold, stands about three-fourths of an inch high and is strung on an adjustable leather cord ($98, 413-528-9455 to order).    7.

The Who's Who of Cooking in America, which recognizes achievement in food or wine, will become the James Beard Awards, sponsored by the foundation along with Champagne Perrier-Jouet and Joseph E. Seagram & Sons. The annual awards had been given by Cook's magazine, which closed this summer.   Annual cookbook awards that have been sponsored by the International Association of Cooking Professionals and Seagram's have been divided into two sets of awards. The association will give its own awards for food and beverage books at its convention in Vancouver, British Columbia, in May. The James Beard Foundation will also be giving book awards for books published in 1990. A third set of awards recognizing restaurants, chefs and wine makers has also been announced by the foundation and Seagram's. All the awards will be presented on May 6 in New York.   Ice Cream All Day    For 99 years Pennsylvania State University has given an annual two-week course in ice-cream making for entrepreneurs and people in the industry. This year's course will run from Jan. 7 to 17 at the University Park campus.    Classes meet from 8 A.M. to 5 P.M. on weekdays. They include lectures about ice cream and the industry and laboratory sessions devoted to tastings and the making of ice cream. This year several classes will be given on fat-free frozen desserts.   The course has 150 spaces. The cost is $350. Information and registration: Short Course Office, (814) 865-8301.   Lasagna and More    Panarella , a restaurant at 513 Columbus Avenue (84th Street), has just opened a charmingly cluttered food shop next door at No. 515. The new shop, Cucina Rustica, is a welcome addition to the neighborhood. Prepared dishes are attractive and well seasoned, if on the expensive side.   A ragout of sausages and peppers, at $11 a pound, reheats beautifully, as does a sturdy meat-laden lasagna or a lighter spinach lasagna ($13 a pound). Some delicious dishes, even if they begin to make this place sound like a West Side edition of E.A.T., are a sprightly salad of tomatoes, olives and wax beans ($11 a pound)","excerpt":"a lusty combination of orecchiette pasta with sun-dried tomatoes ($14.50 a pound), and properly medium-rare seared tuna with herbs ($25 a pound). At $12.50 a pound, the oily grilled vegetables are definitely resistible.   Sandwiches of ham, cheese and vegetables layered on focaccia are more reasonable, $4.75 each, and the prices for cheeses like Italian Parmesan ($10.95 a pound) and grana ($7.95) are fairly in line with those at similar shops. There is an excellent array of breads. Cucina Rustica also sells salami, pasta, coffee, pastries, condiments and antiques. Service is rather disorganized now, so patience is advised. The shop is open every day.   Coffee and Dessert     Dallis Brothers , a coffee-roasting company and wholesaler, has just opened a charming Victorian-style retail shop at 100-30 Atlantic Avenue in Ozone Park, Queens. It has about 75 kinds of coffee, among them some full-bodied exotics like Sumatra and Yemen mocha. There is a long list of flavored and decaffeinated coffees. Prices start at $6.39 a pound and climb to $24.25 a pound for Jamaican blue mountain.   The shop also stocks peas, coffee and tea-making accessories; pastries like brownies from Country Epicure ($1.25 each), and dense biscotti and mandelbrot from Diane's Desserts in Roslyn, L.I. ($12.50 a pound). Candy-coated decaffeinated espresso beans are $8.99 a pound.   The shop has a \\"coffee club\\" program that entitles participants to a free pound of any coffee for every 12 pounds they buy. The shop is open Monday to Friday 8 A.M. to 5 P.M., Saturday 10 A.M. to 5 P.M.   Cooking at a Winery    Sakonnet Vineyards in Little Compton, R.I., is starting a master chef's cooking series. The first of six monthly daylong sessions will be held on Jan. 28 with Todd English, the chef and an owner of Olive's in Boston. Other chefs in the program are Jasper White of Restaurant Jasper in Boston and John Richardson of Pot au Feu in Providence, R.I.   Each class begins at 10 A.M. Dinner for the participants is served starting at 5:30 P.M. The cost for each session, including the banquet, is $175. Information and registration: (401) 635-8486.   Greek Dinner    The Roundtable for Women in Food Service, a networking organization, is sponsoring a Greek dinner on Jan. 7 at Periyali restaurant, 35 West 20th Street. The evening begins at 5:45 P.M. with a reception. Kathy Bouloukos, who runs the recipe club of St. Paul's Greek Orthodox Cathedral in Hempstead, L.I., will speak.    The club has written three Greek cookbooks. The most recent one, \\"The Complete Book of Greek Cookery,\\" was just published by Harper & Row ($27.95).    Tickets for the dinner are $40 for members, $45 for nonmembers. Reservations: (212) 439-0580.   More Mangia    Mangia , a shop at 54 West 56th Street that is known for its inventive and delicious scones and its salads, pastries and other assorted items for catering and takeout, has opened a second, larger store. The new location is 16 East 48th Street; (212) 754-7600. Eventually there will be dining upstairs.   If You Liked the Dessert . . .    New on the market are some liqueurs that take their inspiration from popular desserts. Liqueur Brule, imported by Schieffelin & Somerset , is caramel-flavored Cognac, meant to suggest creme brulee. It is smooth and sweet, with more caramel than brandy in the taste.   Tiramisu, imported from Italy by Winebow , is a spicy blend of coffee and almond liqueurs and can be used for soaking the cookies used in making tiramisu, the dessert.   Both liqueurs are excellent over vanilla ice cream or in after-dinner coffee.   Liqueur Brule is about $17 at Astor Wine and Spirits, 12 Astor Place (Lafayette Street), and Great Eastern Liquor, 600 Hempstead Turnpike, Elmont, L.I. Tiramisu is about $15 at Sherry-Lehmann, 679 Madison Avenue (61st Street); Mount Carmel Wines and Liquors, 612 East 187th Street, the Bronx; Greenvale Wines and Liquors, 330 Wheatley Plaza, Greenvale, L.I., and Wine and Spirits World, 102 Linwood Plaza, Fort Lee, N.J., and 626 North Maple Street, Ho-Ho-Kus, N.J. Whence the Buffalo Mozzarella?    SOME people think buffalo mozzarella comes from Buffalo. Others know that the buffalo in the name refers to water buffalo, whose milk is used to make the cheese, and they think it comes from the region around Naples, Italy. Now they may be wrong, too.   Most buffalo mozzarella does come from Italy but, increasingly, it is also imported from Venezuela, where 65,000 water buffalo roam.   Mimmo Magliulo, the owner of Italfresh of Port Chester, N.Y., imports both Italian and Venezuelan buffalo mozzarella. He said that unlike some buffalo mozzarella from Italy, the Venezuelan variety is made from 100 percent buffalo milk.    \\"I don't care what the labels say on the Italian imports,\\" he said. \\"Most are cut with cow's milk because the buffalo milk is so expensive. In Venezuela they have so much buffalo milk, they don't need to cut it.\\"   The deliciously creamy Venezuelan product, which has been served in restaurants for several months, will soon be available in retail shops. The brand is Tenerella.

After the 18th century, it was usually staged in condensed versions, which is what the Taiwan-based Lan Ting Chinese Opera Troupe did on Thursday night at the Taipei Theater (1221 Avenue of the Americas, between 48th and 49th Streets). So intriguing and lovely was this abridged example of the kun-qu style, however, that I almost wished for a Chinese counterpart to Bayreuth, so such works could be seen in their entirety.   Presumably this opera would then be shown to be a hypnotic, languorously unfolding fantasy about Du Liniang, a young woman who, despite being isolated by a jealous father, finds her true love in the person of a young scholar. The distinctive Chinese turn in this archetypal tale is that the scholar appears to her only in a dream. She dies out of love for the imagined figure, but the Lord of the Underworld allows her to return to earth and seek him in the flesh. Much else would happen over the course of several days of dramaturgy, but after a while, I imagine, the minutely chronicled emotional life of the heroine would take on a mythic character while the sinuous lyricism of this ancient musical style would coax one into a dream state not unlike her own.

Editors' Choice"},{"year":"2003","title":"A MULTITUDE OF SINS: Stories, by Richard Ford. (Vintage Contemporaries, $13.) Typically set during the final throes of an adulterous affair or its immediate aftermath, these tales have less to do with sins than with low-grade personality disorders as they track the self-absorption, vague yearnings and befuddled fortunes of cheaters and the cheated-upon. Last year in these pages, Colson Whitehead admired the author's ''strengths as a scientist of locale'' and said, ''Dick Clark would sooner have a hair out of place than Richard Ford put a word where it shouldn't be.''    TRUE GRIT, by Charles Portis. (Overlook, $13.95.) This rugged 1968 novel features a memorably precocious heroine: Mattie Ross, an Arkansas teenager who hires the one-eyed, whiskey-loving Rooster Cogburn to avenge her father's murder, a quest that leads them deep into Indian Territory to ride down a gang of outlaws in the 1880's. The result is a ''skillfully constructed . . . comic tour de force,'' Richard Rhodes wrote in the Book Review.    GLADSTONE: A Biography, by Roy Jenkins. (Random House, $16.95.) A figure of towering rectitude and moral authority, William Ewart Gladstone (1809-98) was four times prime minister of Britain and a booming voice of liberalism for much of the 19th century. This biography by a former Labor minister ''goes through the sources with commendable zeal,'' Norman Stone said here in 1997. ''His great strength . . . is that he can convey the dreams of speeches in the House of Commons -- theatrical events that recur even now.''    GOULD'S BOOK OF FISH: A Novel in Twelve Fish, by Richard Flanagan. (Grove, $14.) Based on the life of an English convict and painter who died in 1831 while trying to escape a penal colony off Tasmania, this phantasmagoric novel evokes the wonders and horrors of its hero's ordeal and is accompanied by the real Gould's illustrations of the local marine life. ''Flanagan has a terrific narrative energy,'' James Campbell wrote in the Book Review in 2002, and his book is ''one part Rabelais, one part Garc&#237","excerpt":"a M&#225;rquez, one part Ned Kelly.''    CROW LAKE, by Mary Lawson. (Delta, $12.95.) As it unfolds along two tracks -- the first recounting the narrator's orphanhood as a girl, the second her mentoring as a gifted naturalist by her brother -- this novel explores issues of class, guilt, sibling rivalry and the lasting power of childhood experience. ''The assurance with which . . . Lawson handles both reflection and violence makes her a writer to read and to watch,'' Janet Burroway said here last year.    MIRACLE AT ST. ANNA, by James McBride. (Riverhead, $14.) In this World War II novel, four ''Buffalo Soldiers'' from the Army's all-black 92nd Division are stranded in an Italian town, where they interact with the villagers and partisan fighters battling the Nazis. ''McBride . . . creates an intricate mosaic of narratives that ultimately becomes about betrayal and the complex moral landscape of war,'' Charles Wilson wrote here in 2002.    SALT: A World History, by Mark Kurlansky. (Penguin, $15.) Did you know salt was once so valuable it was used as currency? The author finds a river of salt coursing through history and human affairs (we can't live without it), from the travels of Marco Polo to the building of the Erie Canal. It is a story with amazing economic, political, religious, industrial and -- yes -- culinary dimensions. Last year our reviewer, Regina Schrambling, praised the book's ''sharp focus and clear presentation,'' as well as ''the sense of wonder Kurlansky communicates in every chapter.''    SEE NO EVIL: The True Story of a Ground Soldier in the CIA's War on Terrorism, by Robert Baer. (Three Rivers, $14.) The author spent two decades as an adventurous case officer for the Central Intelligence Agency in the Middle East and elsewhere, and his memoir is filled with shady arms dealers, moles, dirty tricks, botched operations and, scariest of all, risk-averse bureaucrats. Even if one-sided, his account ''is entertaining and at times revealing,'' Evan Thomas said here last year.    IN AMERICAN JIHAD: The Terrorists Living Among Us, by Steven Emerson (Free Press, $14), a journalist maintains that loosely linked Muslim extremists, thriving in secret terrorist cells in places like Brooklyn and Tampa, present a growing danger to Americans. Though occasionally misguided or wrong, Emerson ''has performed a genuine service,'' Ethan Bronner wrote here in 2002. ''His information should be taken seriously.''

In this re-creation of the exploits of James Cook (1728-79), whose three voyages to the Pacific filled in many of the world map's blanks, the author signs on as a crew member on a replica of Cook's first ship and sets out for Bora-Bora, Tonga, Australia and beyond. ''A terrific reporter, Horwitz investigates how the places he visits have changed and catalogs the effects that Western civilization . . . has had on the indigenous peoples,'' Robert R. Harris wrote in these pages in 2002.    THE METAL SHREDDERS, by Nancy Zafris. (BlueHen, $13.) This first novel revolves around the beleaguered third-generation managers of a scrap-metal business in Columbus, Ohio: the founder's grandson and granddaughter (a Wellesley grad), who struggle to straighten out their lives under the eye of their cold, imperious father. The result is an ''entertaining and illuminating'' tale by ''an abundantly talented writer,'' Ken Kalfus said here last year.    PORNO, by Irvine Welsh. (Norton, $14.95.) In the sequel to Welsh's rambunctious 1993 novel, ''Trainspotting,'' Simon Williamson (a k a Sick Boy) returns to Edinburgh to take over his aunt's pub and enlist his old gang in a scam involving amateur pornography. This time out, as before, the author seems ''intent on grabbing the English language by the lapels, dunking it in the gutter and kicking it into filthy, vivid, idiomatic life,'' Tom Shone wrote in these pages in 2002.    MASTERS OF DEATH: The SS-Einsatzgruppen and the Invention of the Holocaust, by Richard Rhodes. (Vintage, $14.95.) Examining a pivotal early chapter in the Holocaust, Rhodes, who won a Pulitzer Prize in 1988, tells of the mobile killing squads whose experiences shooting to death more than a million Jews in the Soviet Union led to the industrialized methods of mass murder used at Auschwitz and other gassing centers. ''Through his fine and accessible account, Rhodes deepens our sense of the Holocaust's utter evil,'' Walter Reich said here last year. The Fall of Berlin 1945, by Antony Beevor (Penguin, $16), recalls the final months of World War II, when Berlin was starving and shattered, and when the Red Army carried out untold atrocities against the German people in the name of vengeance. In 2002 our reviewer, Carlo D'Este, found this ''the best account yet written on the death knell of Hitler's vaunted Thousand Year Reich.''    STILLWATER, by William F. Weld. (Harvest/Harcourt, $13.) Set in the valleys of western Massachusetts in the 1930's, this elegiac novel by a former governor of the state is about a corrupt scheme in which Boston power brokers intent on building a reservoir turn to bribery to displace the citizens of a simple, hard-working community and put five farming towns under water. The result is ''a haunting kind of ghost story about a place stewing in its own slow history until it vanishes forever,'' Charles Wilson wrote here in 2002.    THE HEART OF REDNESS, by Zakes Mda. (Picador, $14.) In a tale that shifts back and forth between the present and the mid-19th century, this South African author explores the age-old struggle between the pressures of ''progress'' and the desire to preserve a traditional culture, namely that of the Xhosa people. Mda responds to the nation's ''rapid changes and unpredictable transitions with . . . a new kind of novel: one that combines Gabriel Garc&#237","excerpt":"a M&#225;rquez's magic realism and political astuteness with satire, social realism and critical re-examination of the South African past,'' Tony Eprile said in the Book Review last year.    PEKING STORY: The Last Days of Old China, by David Kidd. (New York Review, $14.) From 1946 to 1950, the author lived as a student and teacher in Beijing, where he married the daughter of an aristocratic family and experienced the siege of the city and its surrender to the Communist Army. ''For Americans who travel to Beijing, or who are interested in the city as it was before the revolution, this book will give a new dimension to their understanding and enjoyment,'' Nien Cheng wrote here in 1988.    SEA ROOM: An Island Life in the Hebrides, by Adam Nicolson. (North Point/Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $14.) When the author turned 21, his father gave him three tiny, rugged islands in the Hebrides, whose rich history, culture and wildlife he gradually comes to appreciate. ''Nicolson's chronicle is a fine book,'' Erica Sanders said here last year. ''Readers . . . will be duly awed by his delicately layered story.''

Moliere, who certainly recognized a good part when he wrote it, chose to play the title role in the original production in 1671. Since then, \\"Scapin\\" has come to be accepted as a most durable farce and one that can be subjected to open interpretation, as in \\"Scapino,\\" the mirthful Jim Dale-Frank Dunlop Italianate variation. At the Classic Stage Company through Feb. 21, Andrei Belgrader gives the play a freewheeling workout, updating it with contemporary references and underscoring it with a harsher line.   As always, \\"Scapin\\" needs an agile scamp, in this case, Stanley Tucci, a quick-change clown with a sly deadpan and a gift for mimicry. With more malevolence than is customary in the role, he puts the intricate plot in motion and then casually sidesteps into improvisation. Interrupting the play, he converses with theatergoers, scrambles through the seats and then settles back waiting for the comedy to continue. But without him onstage, the show takes a long pause.

It opens with nostalgic glimpses of the beautiful countryside of Crete and of the farmers preparing their raisins in charming tranquillity. Then there are shots of the invasion of Greece by the Axis troops—actuality pictures—followed by a sequence re-enacted in England which represents the tricks used by the principal of the story to escape. And then the picture finishes with an interesting survey of the training of Greek sailors in England and their determined pursuit of the enemy in Greek ships.Vrassidas Capernaros plays the hero of the story studiously and speaks the commentary in English with a gratifying restraint. The film is only moderately good cinematically, but it possesses an inherent strength in its story of dauntless courage which should touch and inspire all hearts.Also on the bill at the World is a new Twentieth Century-Fox short showing the training of a Greek battalion for our Army and Greek soldiers fighting beside the British in North Africa","excerpt":"a magic carpet compilation of scenes in prewar Greece and a specially made news review of incidents pertaining to the efforts of Greeks in the war.

Great designers should merely attenuate as they grow older, dissolving at last into wisps of silk, but Mr. Saint Laurent has decided to retire in the flesh instead. After 44 years in haute couture, and 44 years in the Rousseau-like jungle of his own fame, he was probably wise to step down.     With his exit, haute couture, which was already in a cadenza of sorts, now seems truly close to an end, a victim of so much change since 1958, when the 21-year-old Mr. Saint Laurent took over at Dior, that it's really best to think of it as a victim of the world turning. Now the great French design names live on, but without the great French designers. People speak of the heyday of Mr. Saint Laurent's achievement, which came in the 1960's and 70's, the way they speak of the moon landings.

At the time, driven by the critical illness of his 4-year-old son, he was spending his days compulsively painting and repainting the child's portrait. If he got it just right, he believed, somehow the boy would live forever.   Desiderio signed. Over the next 18 months, distraught, despondent, certain he had \\"missed the mark in every single one of the pictures,\\" he produced a dozen works. It was a startling exhibition that went on view at the gallery in February 1993, a series of paintings so much in keeping with one another that the effect was of a suite of elaborately paneled rooms. Most were narrative paintings, and the paint, tinged with pale greens and browns, had been applied in the highly finished manner of the old masters. One huge triptych hung at the center, with half a dozen smaller triptychs here and there. These were filled with scenes of struggle and despair: a grim, naked couple flanked a desolate room","excerpt":"a man wept by the side of a small white coffin. Interspersed among them were several single canvases, less melodramatic but equally troubling. In \\"Savant\\" a little boy lay on a sofa with an old man, the man asleep, the boy nestled against him, radiantly awake. A long green tube snaked from a heavy tank of oxygen to the boy's throat. In \\"Study for a Hero's Life,\\" this same boy lay in a hospital bed, eyes closed, mouth slightly open. A third, \\"Plein-Air,\\" showed him walking alone through a sparse wood, older and, apparently, healthy. Yet even this image was mysteriously unsettling.   The show went almost unnoted by the press, though all the usual critics came to see it. Just before it closed, friends who knew Desiderio invited me there to meet him. Arriving early, knowing nothing about him except for what was on the walls, I circled the rooms a couple of times, moved by the beauty of the pictures but less and less enthusiastic about meeting the artist. What kind of person paints a sick child to create an artistic effect? And how much talent does it take to make such an image disconcerting?    My friends appeared with Desiderio: a smiling, soft-spoken man with pink cheeks, blue eyes and all the Machiavellian guile of, say, a bicycle rental clerk in rural Massachusetts. They introduced us, then swiftly drew me back to \\"Savant,\\" the picture of the old man and the boy. \\"That's his son,\\" one friend said, and went on to murmur a confused story about a birth defect and an operation a couple of years before. Something had gone wrong afterward, and the boy's life had been in continuous jeopardy ever since.   Desiderio rejoined us. As my friends asked after his son, Sam, I moved back a little. \\"Savant\\" now looked painfully intimate -- too intimate, surely, for the artist to confront beside a stranger. But Desiderio, far from excusing himself, plunged into fluent if confounding commentary.   \\"This is a kind of a complicated painting,\\" he began. \\"It's connected to Manet's 'Gare Saint-Lazare' -- do you know it? A woman and a little girl are at a train station; the child is holding onto a gate with vertical bars. Manet loved Velazquez, and I'm convinced he painted those strong verticals in response to Velazquez's 'Surrender of Breda,' in which a row of lances makes a similar effect. I wanted to connect the two paintings with a third. In that sense, it's almost a triptych.\\"   Desiderio pointed out a painting within the painting, a frameless row of vertical stripes above the couch.   \\"Here, the vertical bars became a neo-geometric painting,\\" he resumed. \\"So it's Sammy and his grandfather,\\" he said, then corrected himself at once. \\"Not necessarily Sammy or his grandfather; I mean, they're just characters, one young, one old, with something passing between the two. The grandfather -- modernism? -- is alive and healthy but looks dead. The child -- third-generation abstraction -- is infirm but looks very much alive. So I'm playing with the idea of third-generation abstraction supported by elaborate artificial means, i.e., art criticism,\\" he confided.  \\"So there's a little humor in it.\\"   Desiderio stepped back, smiling genially, as if everything must now be quite clear, then led us to several other paintings. Each received a similar explanation. \\"Romance and Reunion,\\" the enormous triptych that dominated the exhibition -- which to my eye clearly concerned family, birth, the mysteries of inheritance -- was, he said, about overcoming the influence of modernism. \\"Expulsion,\\" the triptych with the grim couple (an especially wretched Adam and Eve, I had thought), concerned \\"the sterility of the aftermath of modernism.\\" Only \\"Premature,\\" a single painting of a premature infant, its head swathed in a turban of bandages, the whole bathed tenderly in Rembrandtesque shadow, escaped such explication.   \\"This doesn't have very much significance, this painting,\\" the artist said. \\"It's nothing more than a picture of a baby.\\"   HOW COULD DESIDERIO SPEAK SO CEREBRALly of paintings that all but punched the viewer in the chest? Between his words and his images -- between his intellect and his imagination -- yawned a curious gap. A downright spooky gap.   Intrigued, I met him for lunch a few weeks after the show closed at a coffee shop near his studio in Long Island City, Queens. Desiderio had grown up in a prosperous Philadelphia suburb. His parents, both children of Italian immigrants, had been reared in a poor section of Philadelphia, but his father had become a successful doctor and his mother a fashion illustrator. In third grade, while the other children drew bunnies on their Easter cards, Vincent surprised the nuns with a rendering of the Resurrection of Christ. At 12, \\"entranced with the Renaissance,\\" he painted Michelangelo's \\"Creation of Adam\\" on the ceiling of the family garage.   He had had a long arts education: four years at Haverford, one in Florence, four more at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts. At Haverford he had met his future wife, Gale, a student at Bryn Mawr. They married in 1980. Three years later, thoroughly trained in accordance with all the best modernist tenets (\\"That you can never paint the figure again, that history is a linear process, that art is evolving,\\" he recited), he went into the world, an abstract painter eager to follow in the revered steps of Arshile Gorky and Willem de Kooning.   DESIDERIO SLID OUT OF THE BOOTH AND LED the way to the chilly, light-filled studio he shares with two sculptors. A new triptych in its earliest stages hung on one wall. The central panel showed a middle-aged man in a tub; on a nearby hamper sat a nurse. \\"This painting started with a man in a bathtub being watched by an attendant,\\" he said. \\"In some sense, I must have been thinking of Sammy. Because Sammy must have someone with him at all times. So if he should grow up -- if he should get that old, you know -- I thought about the nurse always being with him.\\"   Sam had been born with severe hydrocephalus, water on the brain; the fluid that normally circulates in and around the brain gets trapped, pressing on the brain and distorting it. His case was worsened by an encephalocele, a hole in the head. There had been no hint of a problem until Gale abruptly went into labor at the start of her third trimester, in October 1986. She was in her last year at Cornell University Medical College. She was admitted to New York Hospital, Cornell's affiliate, and the labor was stopped with drugs. A sonogram showed the hydrocephalus. It was far too late for an abortion, so a plan was made to stave off labor until the baby's lungs were developed, then deliver him by C-section and rush him into surgery.   The odds were overwhelming. On Sam's birth, Nov. 17, the hole was discovered and repaired. He was fitted with a shunt, a narrow tube that conducts fluid from the brain to the abdomen, where it is harmlessly released. Sam's brain had developed under such intense pressure that at birth it was no more than a thin rim pressed against the interior of the skull. Yet to everyone's amazement he began to thrive, developing on the late end of normal but doing everything babies should. Vincent and Gale, who had been warned that Sam would likely be blind, soon realized that he could see. He started to talk on schedule and grew very sociable. There were setbacks, most notably the onset of seizures. But these were controlled with medication. Sam was \\"the wonder kid of New York Hospital,\\" Vincent said.   During these years, Vincent's career was beginning to take shape. For a while he had painted abstractly, working to join form and content, \\"to make the authentic painting\\" as he had been taught. He would \\"charge\\" himself up, then \\"attack\\" the canvas in search of that passionate mark that would be both peculiarly his and a continuation of the momentum of all art history before him. But he was stumped.   \\"The Abstract Expressionists went the farthest out on that limb you could,\\" he said. \\"They developed that romantic modernist idea as far as it could be developed. They were the greatest painters, and I just couldn't get beyond them.\\" At the same time, he felt increasingly pinched between modernism's \\"constant throwing out of the past\\" and the \\"incredible, meaningful experience\\" he had when he looked at a Delacroix or a Gericault. \\"Modernism says you can never go back. But why can't you?\\"   Desiderio became frustrated, then rebellious. Finally he staged a sorrowful, angry, exuberant mutiny. He \\"jumped the modernist ship\\" -- not backward, toward the \\"naive realism\\" of the past, but up and out \\"into hypermode, a poststructuralist mode,\\" reclaiming in the process the entire legacy of Western art.   Within a year or two, he was painting vast triptychs -- 10 by 25 feet was not unusual -- whose scale and style alluded to the great 19th-century history painters. He intended the pre modern references to remind the viewer that he or she was indeed looking at a painting; that painting, like language, is always the signifier, never the signified. He amalgamated these references with a quasi-allegorical, almost surreal imagery to construct on canvas elaborate, ambiguous polemics about art, politics or philosophy. And the art world responded. In 1987 he signed with a small SoHo gallery, Lang & O'Hara.    In these same years, Gale had finished her training at Cornell and gone on to specialize in psychiatry at New York University School of Medicine. By the fall of 1990, she was also six months into a healthy pregnancy.   One day that October, Sam became pale and lethargic, vomiting repeatedly -- a symptom of pressure inside the head. By evening, the trouble was diagnosed: his shunt was blocked, a common development. By midnight, he was in surgery at New York Hospital. He emerged at around 2 A.M., his head wrapped in bandages (\\"like a swami,\\" said Vincent, \\"like the kid in 'Premature.' \\"), tired and cranky, but talking. Vincent stayed with him; Gale, pregnant and exhausted, left. According to Sam's medical records, he continued to vomit as the night went on. At one point, a nurse noted in his chart that his pupils were unequal in size, a likely sign that the brain was being pushed out of place by accumulating liquid. His new shunt had failed. The pressure became so extreme that his brain herniated -- was forced partly into the opening at the base of the skull where the spinal cord meets the brain stem. In the morning, the malfunctioning shunt was replaced, but the damage had been done.    \\"It was like someone took a cue ball and shattered our lives,\\" said Vincent. Sam suffered several strokes. He was left paralyzed and in a coma. In the months that followed, he gradually regained consciousness, motion and speech. But his ability to breathe on his own had been compromised. His progress was slow, uncertain, studded with reversals. After what had happened, Gale and Vincent were unwilling to leave him alone for even a moment. (In 1993 they filed a malpractice suit, which is pending. New York Hospital denied the charges in court papers and has declined to discuss the case.) In mid-December, Gale gave birth to their second son, Oscar, while Vincent shuttled from her bedside to Sam's, several floors below.   At the same time, Vincent had his most successful exhibition ever -- his third solo show at Lang & O'Hara. On the last day, the Metropolitan Museum of Art bought \\"Sleeping Family,\\" a single canvas showing an almost aerial view of a sleeping couple, their young son between them. Soon afterward, Lang & O'Hara folded. But Marlborough stepped in, a dazzling deus ex machina.   Nearly four months after his shunt became blocked, Sam was finally stable enough to leave New York Hospital for Blythedale, a children's rehabilitation hospital an hour north of Manhattan. His memory and intelligence were intact. But he had lost the automatic reflex that forces the body to breathe when respiration has been interrupted. Now when he had a seizure -- and he had them often -- Sam would stop breathing. A tracheostomy, a surgical opening into the windpipe, allowed quick ventilation of his lungs at such moments. But because the seizures occurred without warning -- and because failure to respond immediately meant death -- he needed constant attendance.   A VAST CANVAS HUNG NEAR THE BACK OF Vincent's studio, the central panel for a projected triptych. It showed a seance taking place in a darkly painted, richly furnished room.   \\"This was the first big triptych I tried to do after Sammy got sick,\\" said Vincent, surveying it doubtfully. \\"It's got grave problems, but I don't throw it out, because it's got certain things about it that are very beautiful.    \\"I started with this image of a seance, a seance in a room of history,\\" he went on. \\"And these people -- I thought initially they were revisionist historians trying to understand what had happened before us -- instead of using scientific methods, they've allowed themselves to indulge in the supernatural, in a conjuring of the past. But it got very dark. I couldn't control it. I worked on it for seven months straight and it just got darker and darker.\\" He pointed to a number of paintings within the painting.   \\"These paintings are all about women, all about sexual conflicts. This is Judith and Holofernes, by Cavallino -- see, she's kind of quizzically looking out at you, and she's got the head of Holofernes that she's just cut off. And this is Jezebel, being thrown from the tower and devoured by dogs. And this is a painting by Manfredi, of Mars beating Cupid, with Venus interceding. It's a family triangle -- even though Mars and Cupid aren't father and son, it has that look -- and there's a kind of pact between the child and the mother to do in the father. So it's all these gender struggles, family struggles, Oedipal struggles.\\"   As at the gallery, nothing in Vincent's slightly bemused tone suggested that these images had any personal resonance, that the idea of revising history might have particular appeal to a man whose happiness had been wrecked by the events of a single night, that an ambitious man in his situation might sometimes feel he had been \\"done in\\" by his wife and child. Looking at the Manfredi painting-within-the-painting, I murmured something to the effect that, even as adults, we tend to cast ourselves as the child in the Oedipal triangle.  And yet, in a very profound sense, at the time he painted the seance, Vincent had been a father.   \\"Yeah, well, I'll tell you, it's very intriguing to think of the relationship between Gale and me as becoming the sort of Adam and Eve relationship, where the original sin produced Sam, who had birth defects,\\" he said abruptly. \\"Eventually Gale and I got much closer than we'd ever been.  But there's a lot of guilt associated with----.\\" He broke off.   \\"You know, he was my child and I was in the very room while he was herniating,\\" he said. \\"I was in the room there with him, you know? I mean I was doing my best as a lay person to alert the staff that he was not doing well. Nonetheless, you feel, Could I have done more? But I don't know what more I could have done.\\"   Vincent sat beside the studio's big windows and talked expansively about the tub picture (\\"I started thinking about the guy in the bathtub as being structuralism, this old, weak mode . . . .\\"), then about art in general. His mind hopped furiously from idea to idea. Socialism, Cubism, Barthes, Zola, Habermas -- names and theories flew like the spray of sawdust thrown up under a whirling blade.   \\"There's a lot about Vincent's own life that he paints,\\" Gale, a small, fair woman whose mild brown eyes and delicate features give her the look of a Renaissance angel, told me later. \\"But he very rarely will directly address that,\\" she added. \\"To him, it's about some really complex, titan battle of art historical principles. You know, we talk about painting all the time.  It's something we really love. And painting really is about these intellectual conversations. But sometimes you just have to tell him, 'Would you shut the hell up about that stuff?' \\"   IN SPRING 1992, VINCENT AND Gale, now a practicing psychiatrist, moved to Tarrytown, to be close to Blythedale. For a long time, every Friday, Saturday and Sunday, they would drive to Blythedale, take Sam home for the day and return him at night; two evenings a week, they visited him at the hospital. Sam was there more than two years before he came home for good, accompanied by a rotating staff of 24-hour nurses.    On a damp Saturday morning not long before his return, their kitchen was a picture of cozy domesticity. Gale was making brownies. Sam, who doesn't like loud noises, was next to her, nervously eyeing the mixer. Oscar was on the floor, beating the tar out of some kind of postmodern Tinkertoy.   Within minutes, Sam was standing beside me, leaning against me, holding my hands, a tall, handsome 6-year-old with tousled dirty-blond hair and rebellious front teeth. The strokes affected his balance and he cannot stand unsupported. His appearance -- a bit off, a bit shaky -- might have disconcerted me if my eyes had not been prepared by the paintings.   \\"What's your name?\\" he demanded, though we had just been introduced. His ability to reason and remember are good, but the anticonvulsants that control his seizures make him groggy; the stroke damage makes it difficult for him to express his thoughts. I hadn't been in the house half an hour before he kissed me, the first of many kisses.    \\"He used to be this really brash, bubbly little devil. Now he's more weepy and lovey,\\" Gale said later. \\"I think he feels a lot of this is his fault. That's why he's so kissy and apologetic.\\"   \\"Sam's had to deal with things most of us never have to deal with,\\" Vincent says. \\"But he's learned to cope by expressing affection for his tormenters. It almost reminds me of the way hostages adopt the philosophical views of their captors.\\"   Sam and I discussed the color of my sweater (lavender) and the noise of the mixer (mean). With a curiously intimate gesture, he showed me a small plastic figurine clutched in his hand.   \\"That's actually a Ghostbuster, I think,\\" Gale told me.   \\"He isn't a Ghostbuster,\\" objected Sam.   \\"Who is he?\\"   \\"He is Dad.\\"   Later, Vincent put Sam to bed for a nap. He undressed him and injected several medicines into his gastrostomy tube, which runs from a surgically created opening near Sam's waist directly to his stomach. Unable to swallow since the herniation, Sam receives all his nourishment through this tube. In all the turmoil, he had not yet been toilet-trained, so Vincent changed him.  Then, with a green tube like the one that winds through \\"Savant,\\" Vincent hooked him up to a supply of humidified air mixed with oxygen. He poured out a liquid food and turned on a pump to propel it into the gastrostomy tube. Then he attached a monitor to Sam's toe; if his oxygen level dipped, it would sound an alarm. Then Vincent kissed him.    Gale was raised a Quaker and has continued as an adult to attend Quaker meeting. But for a year after the herniation, she stopped. \\"People always say to me, 'How did you survive it?' \\" she said, late that afternoon. \\"But you don't have a choice, because you don't die.\\"    TWO WEEKS LATER, VINCENT SAT IN HIS STUdio with a stack of slides and catalogues. He had often painted Sam before the Marlborough show, but in the earlier pictures, the boy was clearly a symbol among symbols -- for example, a priest raised a baby aloft rather than the Host. It was Sam, all right, but there was none of the agonized rendering of him so evident in the Marlborough show. But why not? Some of these earlier pictures had been painted just after his birth, before his unexpected recovery.    When Sam was first born, Vincent explained, \\"there was an opportunity for denial, and we took advantage of it. We were never sure whether he understood us, whether he saw or didn't. He was like an abstract painting. You could develop any text for him. And that's what we did.   \\"But when he got sick and we had to be there and he was dying and -- oh, this wasn't expected to happen! And that we couldn't deny.\\"   Sam's sickness \\"infiltrated the imagery\\" of Desiderio's work: \\"He became a pure symbol, a metaphor for a damaged legacy.\\"    Vincent tried to pray just after Sam herniated.  \\"But it didn't last,\\" he says. \\"It seemed the more I prayed, the worse he got.\\" Instead, he began to paint Sam, beginning with \\"Study for a Hero's Life.\\" \\"I started -- it's sick, but I was kind of screwed up at the time.\\" His voice dropped to a hoarse whisper. \\"I was doing that painting, of him in the hospital, and he kept getting sicker and sicker. I stopped work on that picture, turned it to the wall, and he started getting a little better. And I started thinking, Oh my God, there's something wrong with this picture. So I started the painting of him walking\\" -- \\"Plein-Air\\" -- \\"because I thought, If I do this, he's going to get better. At the back of my mind, I knew it wasn't real, but there was something delusional about all this.\\"   Obsessed with the notion of making the painting \\"be Sam,\\" making \\"the signifier touch the signified,\\" Desiderio tried desperately to compress the two. \\"But it was impossible, impossible, impossible. . . .\\" A moment later: \\"Oh, it's so stupid!\\" he burst out. \\"What could be more naive?  But the agony of this picture for me was trying to paint it knowing it was only a painting.   \\"I guess by painting him I had this idea that I could keep him alive forever,\\" he continued.  \\"And this sort of crazy idea that if I painted him walking, he would walk again. You know? If I made it just right. . . . Crazy. Desperation.\\"    It occurred to me that the Marlborough show had developed under a pressure no less intense, perhaps, than the pressure on Sam's unborn brain. And that Vincent had painted it was nearly as astonishing as Sam's having thrived.   SAM, NOW 8, HAS SETTLED IN AT HOME AGAIN. He knows all his letters and can sound out words, though fluent reading still eludes him. He has also learned to use the bathroom. Hoping it would stop the seizures, his doctors recently put him on a high-fat diet. His seizures are less frequent, but they have not stopped.  Gale is pregnant again. The baby is due in May.   ONE OF VINCENT'S FAVORITE PAINTINGS from the Marlborough show is a triptych called \\"Untitled Loss.\\" The left panel shows a man at prayer, the right a man picking up a weapon in anger. In the center, a red buoy floats on a dark sea.   \\"A painting like this,\\" he said one day, gazing at a reproduction, \\"at its core, there's a total involvement with the unknowable.\\" One man converts his uncertainty into faith, the other into violence. But \\"abdication of one's will to religion, or this gesture of violence when you don't know what you're raging against, these are both very superficial gestures,\\" Desiderio said.  \\"And you see, their backs confront you; they stop your vision almost at the surface of the pictures.\\"   But in the center \\"is this dimensionless sea, defined by a single marker. And your eye wants to go beyond the page, wants to go deep in. It's as if in this nothingness, only our action defines -- It's an existential thing; there's the void and the action in the void.\\" He talked on for some minutes in such terms, then broke off as if suddenly weary. \\"I don't know,\\" he said. \\"I don't know. That's why it's called 'Untitled Loss.' \\" Painting Life Into Sammy"},{"year":"1960","title":"Article on reaction to own success since formulation of 'Parkinson's Law,' His Law Transforms Parkinson","excerpt":"A man who achieves a pinnacle of success can find that it makes a somewhat uneasy perch, says one who should know.

Besides the New Zealand golf, the tour includes three days of sightseeing (and a round of golf) in Sydney","excerpt":"a Maori feast with dancing and chanting and sightseeing in New Zealand; and a final weekend (with golf) in Fiji, where awards will be presented during the course of a Fijian luau.   Based on double occupancy, the trip -leaving San Francisco Feb. 11, 1986, and returning to Los Angeles March 4 - is priced at $4,325. The price includes round-trip air fare, flights within New Zealand, all accommodations, all breakfasts and dinners during 12 days in New Zealand, greens and entry fees, prizes, ground transportation, transfers and porterage.   DOWN UNDER FOR GOLF, TO THE OCEAN FOR JAZZ"},{"year":"1929","title":"\\"The Romance of Hine-Moa,\\" a pictorial tale based on a Maori legend and produced in New Zealand with a Maori cast, is now on exhibition at the Fifty-fifth Street Playhouse. It is a subject that might be interesting to those who are steeped in the lore of the Maoris, but to less fortunate individuals this film possesses many a dull moment.One can assume that the appearence of the Maoris has greatly changed, with, their civilization. In this production it is far too evident that the performers, who are not professional actors, are striving to imitate their ancestors. But their mannerisms, when they forget their forefathers, are of 1929, and likewise their haircuts. There are instances when these temporary players appear to be seized with a sudden desire to play to the grand stand. Perhaps they see in their mind's eye the vast, hosts that may gaze upon their shadows, and therefore decide to give an extra twist to their native knives, and the females are impelled to dance with greater enthusiasm and grace.The legend itself is not especially perturbing in print and still less so in the manner in which it is pictured. Occasionally there are scenes that catch the eye, like the flash of a warrior rubbing noses with a rival before the first round of the duel begins, or the gentle way in which the lovers' noses just touch as a sign of affection.Irma Caron, an exponent of Maori music, appears on the stage before the screening of the picture and with a pleasing voice tells of the Maoris. Miss Caron, who is arrayed in a Maori costume, also dances and sings some pleasing songs. In fact, Miss Caron succeeds where the picture fails.While its fun belongs to the rowdy school, \\"Say Ah,\\" a comedy with Charles Bowers, is by no means without merit. Its subject, one concerned with ostrich eggs and humor as a care for a violent temper, can he styled original. Of course, the most is made of the digestive powers of the ostrich, and the sight of its, eggs will keep many persons away from a boiled egg for a month or more.

Southwestern blues phrases, dry and cynical, punctuate the solos, and rhythms pile on rhythms. At age 67, Mr. Kessel, who will be performing through Sunday at the Village Vanguard in his first New York appearance in nearly a decade, is a master, and in his hands a good part of American music and culture become audible.    One of the first modern jazz guitarists, Mr. Kessel has performed with everyone from Art Tatum to Liberace, but he started his professional career in 1937 as a 14-year-old guitarist in Ellis Ezell's band in Muskogee, Okla. That in itself would not be so unusual, except for the fact that Mr. Kessel was a white teen-ager working in a black dance band in black clubs in Oklahoma.

The first concert, last Thursday, was devoted to Baroque music, and the finale, on Saturday, will be a bouquet of favorites by Albeniz, Falla and Barrios. But although Mr. Williams's mastery of those styles is evident from his many recordings, in some ways the most inviting of the three was the 20th-century program he played on Tuesday evening.   Actually, Mr. Williams's taste in new music is on the conservative side, and although the program brought together composers from an unusually broad geographic range -- Australia, Japan, Russia, the Czech Republic, Spain, Cuba and Italy were represented -- stylistic variety was less pronounced. Tonality reigned, and most of the works, including the latest additions to Mr. Williams's repertory, were built on harmonies, arpeggiation styles and juxtapositions of timbre that fell naturally on the fretboard.

One of the few surviving masters of the style, Earl Wild, celebrated his 75th birthday on Monday with a recital at Carnegie Hall.    Mr. Wild made no concessions to his age in choosing his program. Indeed, there seemed a strain of defiance in his choices: Beethoven's 32 Variations on an Original Theme (WoO 80) before the intermission, with the concert's second half devoted to Liszt roof-raisers. There were moments when he was not as glowingly precise as he once was. More surprisingly, there were passages in the Beethoven Variations and in Liszt's \\"Funerailles\\" that were phrased more squarely than one is used to hearing in Mr. Wild's performances.

The world premiere of his Fourth Symphony, a work commissioned by the orchestra, received a warm and enthusiastic reception. And at the conclusion of the concert, there was a prolonged standing ovation.   The acclaim was deserved. Over the course of a long career, Mr. Lutoslawski has established himself as a leading composer of the post-World War II generation, one of a group of Eastern European and Soviet composers (including Gyorgy Ligeti, Gyorgy Kurtag and Alfred Schnittke), whose work has been highly original and idiosyncratic, despite the pressures of Communist regimes. Composers like Shostakovich wrote music that could brilliantly undercut official taste while seeming to satisfy it, but Mr. Lutoslawski, whose First Symphony was banned by Stalinist censors in 1949, led a double compositional life. For many years, he earned money writing radio and film music for the Government while devising his own atonal language and style in solitude.

General in the United States Air Force and former Chancellor of Long Island University in New York, Hoxie was well known in senior government circles. In 1968 he founded the non-partisan Center for the Study of the Presidency as a forum on the institution of the U.S. Presidency, and established the Presidential Studies Quarterly as a resource and archive for historians and Presidential scholars. Most importantly, Hoxie was deeply committed to the leadership development of young men and women. For this purpose he established the Annual Student Symposium at which college student leaders from around the nation and abroad came to interact with government leaders and other senior level specialists on issues instrumental to the American Presidency.

Printing and proliferating began with labor-intensive wood engravings and developed gradually until the start of the 18th century, when new engraving procedures liberated commercial music publishing once and for all. But in between appeared another idea: musical scores set by movable type. The system began in Italy at the start of the 16th century and spread through Europe.

If all goes according to plan, by this summer 80 paintings and 8 sculptures belonging to the renowned Thyssen-Bornemisza Collection will be on permanent view in what for centuries was the monastery's dormitory.   The Pedralbes itself can still be visited, though parts are sealed off to respect the privacy of a dozen or so remaining nuns. Other sections have also been closed pending further restoration. But between 10 A.M. and 2 P.M. daily, for an entrance fee of about $2.50, visitors can pray in its Gothic church, enjoy the peace of its cloisters, look at religious art in a small museum or peek into nuns' cells dating back centuries.

However, in raising the bamboo curtain on a miniscule portion of the vast land mass that supports the world's largest population. Mr. Greene provides vivid illustrations of some well-fed, happy people dedicated to industry and play in their Communist state and, anomalously, arouses gnawing doubts about the well-being of the rest of the more than 600 million Chinese, who are not represented.Mr. Greene, an Englishman now living in this country, photographed \\"China!\\" with Hsu Chih-chiang on a commission from British television interests, reportedly during four months of travel in 1963, which took him some 15,000 miles from Shanghai to Mongolia. In his commentary, which is largely apolitical and spoken without heat by Alexander Scourby, he makes the point that since the 1949 revolution, Mao Tsetung and his associates have brought about remarkable changes both in rural and urban living, a point that is not precisely news.Although there is a short section of old, black-and-white news clips depicting the invasion of China by the Japanese and the strife between the Mao and Chiang Kai-shek forces up to 1949, the bulk of the 65-minute film is devoted to Mr. Greene's latter-day color shots. These are visually impressive, if not exhaustive. A vast Peking square is filled with marching, cheering adults and children in great, varicolored phalanxes. Masked and costumed dancers perform at the Peking Opera. Scenes on the Shanghai docks and streets bring the commentary that China trades with 120 countries.Millions live in slums, the narrator states. Some of the slums are shown being torn down. Happy workers, both on lathes and in the fine arts such as carving, pass in review as do children singing, in English, an American integration song. Views of consumer goods, such as cosmetics, being sold and kids enjoying a basketball game quickly flash by, as do brief shots of religious observances in officially atheistic China.Moving out of the cities the producer achieves some striking, but short impressions of contended people.

His commentary climactically declares that \\"China!\\" makes \\"no conclusions.\\" Unlike the initial views of ancient Chinese works of art, literature and sculpture that \\"still speak to us over the centuries,\\" this present \\"China!\\" doesn't tell us enough by a long shot.Also on the program is a 14-minute, black and white short subject filmed by Mr. Greene on the Peking Symphony Orchestra, formed nine years ago.

Mr. Rasky uses paintings, photographs, songs and dances, artifacts (including masks) and dozens of interviews as he meditates on the high cost of the European invasion to the indigenous peoples: near-genocide.

It is exactly like a race in old Erin, and it makes you think quite a bit of the Grand National, and, as every one knows, it's invariably an Irish horse that wins at Aintree. It's a great picture this, with the mists hanging over the dear old roads, the green, he cottages and the water. The black-hearted scoundrel now and again, it's true, gives you too much of his infernal smirking, and John Ford, the director, a man from Irish stock, makes this villain drink too much. Sure he's always carrying the bottle with him through the rooms of the fine old castle, the place that's known as \\"Hangman's House,\\" for it's there that James O'Brien lives. And he's the fellow who sees in the Ïreplace of his library all the men and women he's sentenced to death.Victor McLaglen, with a cuss every how and again on his lips for John Darcy, is grand as Citizen Hogan, that splendid fellow who poses as a monk and then as a blind beggar, so as to even up matters with Darcy. It's he who weds first Hogan's sister, and deserts her, and then takes for his bride Connaught O'Brien, who is in love with that upstanding young chap, Dermott McDermott. It's Dermott, bless his soul, who wins the race on St. Stephen's Day, and it's that blackguard Darcy, who, after having caused a jockey to be murdered, shoots the poor horse.This story has an excellent start, for Citizen Hogan is introduced as an officer in the French army in Algiers, and it's after returning from ??? patrol that he receives a telegram ???etting him know that his sister died shortly after Darcy deserted her. What would you expect a man like Hogan to do? Just what he does. He stands up at the mess table and ???ays to his commandant:\\"You'll have to be excusing me for ??? while, as I've got a man to kill.\\"You don't then know why, but you suspect that any man that Hogan's going to kill deserves all that he gets. There's no shilly-shallying about Hogan, for he travels to Ireland to find his man, risking capture by the British, who have offered a reward for him, dead or alive. The first glimpse that Darcy catches of Hogan, dressed as a monk, causes Mr. Darcy to expect that his end's coming soon and that it's not going to be a very comfortable exit from the world.Faith, and the Judge's daughter, Connaught, surely inherited her prettiness and her kindness from her mother. She's so sweet that when the selfish old Judge asks her to marry Darcy she consents to do so to satisfy this father of hers. The old man at the time is told by his physician that he may live a day or so and possibly a month, but no more. That's his sentence for sending so many poor people to the gallows. And he doesn't live a month. The knowledge that he's going to die soon causes the monster to reflect on his inhuman sentences, and this hastens the end. Anyway, his daughter is unlike him. She has a charming nose, eyes like the reflections in Killarney's lakes, real eyebrows that haven't been plucked and lips, which, although the picture isn't colored, bring to one's mind a red rose. And in real life all this beauty belongs to June Collyer, whose acting is good, but occasionally it seems as though she were a little nervous. And, seeing all that's happening around her, with a bearded villain winning her hand in marriage, it's no wonder that she is occasionally kind of scared.Larry Kent is a nice young man. He plays Dermott, who wins the horse race and also, as you expect, Connaught. It is a man named Earle Foxe who officiates as Darcy. Mr. Foxe is pretty good, for he makes Darcy just about as bad a villain as one would hope to see. But Mr. Foxe is a trifle too fond of smiling in a sinister fashion when he's got the upper hand. It's the smile of anticipation, like that of Victor MeLagIen, that means something. Those old-fashioned villains always used to snort and smirk, but the new type, although just as bad, don't care to reveal their gratification at an ignoble victory.And, just before \\"Hangman's House\\" flows to the screen, there are sundry features of considerable interest, especially a charming affair preceding the picture. It has nothing to do with Ireland. It's a Venetian fantasy, rich and lovely, with a fine sense of color combinations and graceful dancing. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"A Melodrama, of Ireland. Messrs. Dane and Arthur. The Soul of a City. Other Photoplays."},{"year":"1925","title":"Just as the main title of \\"The Lady\\" was flashed upon the Colony screen yesterday afternoon two old ladies with White hair took seats in the first row of the balcony. In modulated, cultured tones they commented upon the scenes as the story was unfurled. Norma Talmadge, who apepars in the principal rôle, immediately found favor in their eyes. She reminded them of somebody they knew. Soon these two spectators were living in bygone years, being deeply stirred by some of the passages of the melodrama, which was translated to the screen from Martin Brown's play.Possibly the two old ladies remembered the time when Lottie Collins sang \\"Ta-ra-ra-doom-deay\\" and became the rage of London, in the days when hansom cabs were the principal conveyance to the theatres. Polly Pearl (Miss Talmadge) was a stage favorite like Lottie Collins, and the two old ladies exchanged a few words when Polly appeared in the short skirts of an old-fashioned soubrette. These two old ladies saw Folly as the centre of attraction, with a dozen stagedoor johnnies waiting hopefully with bouquets in their arms. Later Polly appears in Monte Carlo as the wife of the aristocratic Leonard St. Aubyne, and the old ladies were affected and sighed when Polly discovered her husband in the arms of another woman.The film version of \\"The Lady\\" is really well done, and Miss Talmadge gives one of the finest performances of her screen career. She is sympathetic and sweet as the elderly woman who is telling the story of her unfortunate life. She is captivating, vivacious and charming as the nimble-toed dancer who weds the faithless St. Aubyns, and she is excellent in the highly emotional moments when, as a mother, she parts with her baby to save him from being taken by the selfish father of her late husband. She is real as the woman, selling flowers in foggy London, wondering whether every little boy who passes is her child.The settings in this effort are quite good, the weak point about the picture being the subtitles, which were obviously written by somebody who knows little of the cockney parlance. In these captions one sees modern American slang and countless other errors, and it is certain that if more attention had been paid to this text it would have improved the picture considerably, for although those who have never been to London and never have heard the Bow Bells cockney utterance may not be any the wiser, the effect of words such as were spoken by Mary Nash in the play and spelled according to the pronunciation would have impressed anybody much more than these careless captions. Although it must be admitted this feature did not spoil the production for the two old ladies, it did not emphasize certain situations, and therefore lost much of the impetus of the play.George Hackathorne, as the grown soldier son who accidentally shoots his old pal, is agreeable and compelling. Perhaps some of the pathetic scenes are prolonged, and it would be more telling to cut them, but the sudden discovery of the son by the elderly mother is compelling. She learns who he is by his identity disc, which, like all soldiers in the World War, he wears on his wrist.The part of Tom Robinson, the amusing bookmaker, is played by Alf Goulding, who does not rise to the possibilities of the character as did Victor Morley on the stage. Fanny LeClare, the chorus girl, is impersonated by Doris Lloyd, whose make-up and costume are quite effective, as is also her characterization.In the initial scenes Polly, old and worn, is seen talking to Mr. Wendover (Marc McDermott). There is a flashback as she relates the events in her life, not knowing that her own son is one of two British soldiers seated at a table in the café over which she presides in Havre. Mr. McDermott is quite stiff, giving nothing like the admirable performance he did in \\"He Who Gets Slapped.\\"Franke Borsage, who directed this pictorial effort, has for the most part done a creditable piece of work. You may take it from the two gray-haired old ladies that this is a photo-melodrama worth an hour and a half of any one's time.

He was made a General Partner in 1981 and was responsible for Bear Stearns Fixed Income, Financing, Trading and Sales. He was a General Partner and became a member of the Executive Committee before Bear Stearns went public in 1985. His tenure at Bear Stearns accredited him with the design and implementation of the Fixed Income Trading and Finance Systems that were instrumental to the growth of Bear Stearns business. In addition to the design of these systems, Mr. Mattone was co-head of all trading, sales and financings. While at Bear Stearns, Mr. Mattone completed one of the largest clearing transactions in firm's history. Simultaneously he brought in the State of Ohio's 25 billion-dollar pension and investment portfolios as clearing and lending agent.

In addition, he worked on the development of the Depository Trust Company and the Midwest Clearing Corporation.

Mr. Mattone started the matched book business for Salomon Brothers and was instrumental in creating funding opportunities with tax advantages for both its partners and customers. Mr. Mattone created a term funding market with financing trades being done as long as 20 years.

Unfortunately, one is obliged to wade through many pages of extraneous material in order to discover and savor these sidelights on the management of a Midlands shooting estate, and in this reviewer's opinion this book cannot take the place of J. R. Miller's 'Practical Gamekeeping'.'' That Secret Desire"},{"year":"1931","title":"Death JUSTICE WALLING DIES IN HIS ERIE (PA.)

A tremendous amount of information is packed into this portrait of the internationally known American choreographer, whose work has been performed in New York City by American Ballet Theater. His life and 50 years of performing and choreographing unfold in a single hour, together with a judicious sprinkling of reminiscences that give a sense of the worlds in which Mr. Tetley grew as an artist.         Linking the episodes in this collagist documentary, edited by Elizabeth Long, are scenes in which dancers from the Dutch National Ballet rehearse and perform  \\"Voluntaries,\\" a soaring Tetley signature ballet. Mr. Blackwood, who has made dccumentaries about American postmodernist dance, Butoh and painting and architecture, plunges into Mr. Tetley's life work with stills and clips of \\"Pierrot Lunaire,\\" his haunting first ballet, and a succession of increasingly streamlined dances that emphasize ballet technique over modern dance.

The fault dramatically is that any of these episodes—and particularly that concerning Alexei's plot—would have been enough by itself for a complete film.

It may have its off moments so far as the few serious incidents are concerned, but when it stoops to farce, there is no denying its jollity. And Miss Swanson is at her best during these riotous interludes.There are scenes in the film that are not particularly well photographed and two or three of the characters change their minds abruptly. But, on the whole, it is a well-worked out entertainment, wherein gusts of merriment cause one to overlook its occasional flaws. The authors and producers of this picture are that successful trio, De Sylva, Brown and Henderson, who have been responsible for several stage musical comedies. This picture was directed by Leo McCarey, who reveals a decided aptitude for handling farcical incidents. During these outbursts of fun virtually every one in the cast has a chance to contribute to the gayety.It is the type of story that without its levity might easily have been a dull affair, for it deals with a girl named Geraldine Trent, known familiarly as Jerry, played by Miss Swanson, falling in love with an author after having had an affair with a scamp, and then learning that the latter is engaged to her young sister, Joan. To kill Joan's faith in Jim Woodward, Jerry pretends that her old affection for him is re-kindled. She does this so effectively that when the author, Tony Blake, sees Woodward and Jerry apparently much enamored of each other, he stalks away and prepares to go to Europe alone.The fun, however, that crops up during the proceedings makes this tale anything but dull. Tony is supposed to be the author of a book titled \\"Obey That Impulse,\\" and his love for Jerry is only a little less impulsive than Jerry's love for him. They are filled with the jole de vivre so soon as they realize their infatuation for each other, and they go forth with an idea of obeying their impulses. Jerry thinks that she would like to join some young urchins in a baseball game, and she breaks a window. The owner of the dwelling appears in a very bad temper, and eventually he takes it into his head to see how Tony and Jerry like having their automobile wind-shield broken.After this comes a sequence devoted to buffoonery with ice-cream cones and an inconvenient shop door. This episode happens to be one of those that must be seen to be appreciated. The high mark of merriment is reached when Buster Collins, the young rival for Joan's hand, after imbibing a cocktail or two to give him courage, has an inspiration to discourage Jim Woodward's parents from consenting to their son's marriage to Jerry's sister. First, he tells Jim's father that Joan's Aunt Kate is a bootlegger, and then he hazards that there is \\"just a teeny-weeny dash\\" of insanity in the Trent family. After leaving the elder Woodward, Buster, admirably played by Arthur Lake, confides to Jerry what he has told Woodward Senior, and later Jerry is perceived handling a knife in strange fashion and putting half a dozen lumps of sugar into her cup of consomm.Jerry, who finds that the insanity notion is highly successful, goes over to her Aunt Kate, who several times boasts that she knew Buffalo Bill, and declares that Woodward's father was also acquainted with the famous scout and showman. Aunt Kate, being by that time slightly affected by strong beverages, makes signals to the elder Woodward that convince him that there is a strong strain of insanity in the Trents.Now and again the film sobers up, but the director and the authors have solved a way of inoculating it with further mirth, and even at the end there is a streak of fun that is almost Chaplinesque.Ben Lyon is capital as Tony. Monroe Owsley puts in some good acting as Jim Woodward, Maude Eburne is excellent as the adipose Aunt Kate. In fact, Miss Eburne shares acting honors with Miss Swanson and Mr. Lake.

For here is a little picture which, despite a certain primitive charm and ingratiating native acting, is so clumsily produced and so tedious in its exposition that it is likely to have an appeal for only a limited and specialized audience.\\"La Noche de los Mayas\\" is the tragedy-laden fable of a beautiful Mayan girl who forsakes her native lover for a white explorer whose excursions bring him to her village in Yucatan, and thereby calls down great sorrow and presumably the wrath of the gods upon her people. It is a simple tale, in which folklore, witchcraft and native customs are prominently and interestingly manifest, and much of the photography has an eye-pleasing documentary quality. Likewise Estela Inda as the girl and Arturo de Cordoba as her native lover impart a refreshingly genuine flavor to the fiction.

This film, with Señor Barreiro as the \\"hero\\" and the comely Carmen Guerrero as the principal female figure, tells the tragedy and romance of the long struggle, that freed Mexico from the despotic rule of Porfirio Diaz in the form of the fate of a family of comfortable ranch owners.

In the manner of filmland, and of civil war, they meet later on the battlefield. But the director clings to facts so closely that the ending hardly can be called a happy one.The love interest is relegated to a minor position and most of the film is devoted to fighting, ranging from petty skirmishes to the decisive battles of Zacatecas, where Villa and his comrades broke the power of the old government's army, and of Celaya, where his forces, then in rebellion against the revolutionary régime, were crushed by those of General Obregon. The scenes of battle are relieved by humorous incidents in the guerrilla warfare and the singing of some sentimental songs. Many of the types shown on the screen seem almost too real.

There was no way they could compete with television news footage, either in speed or convenience. Nor, generally speaking, in quality. Most of the time they were patchy views of a rather scatterbrained reality. Sneezing contests would alternate with politicians cutting ribbons and South Americans rioting.But once in a while there was something unforgettable: the Hindenburg floated loftily into sight and suddenly settled on the ground like burning tinsel","excerpt":"a middle-aged Frenchman wept at Toulon when the fleet was scuttled. The newsreel cameras and the big screen provided an authority to these things that television equipment couldn't manage. Also there was the effect of waiting a day or two to see a disaster you had read of. World events were discrete, individual, weighty. They did not flood us.A diffuse, somewhat unsatisfactory but reasonably interesting retrospective of newsreels in America is provided by \\"Yesterday's Witness,\\" which opened yesterday at the Film Forum.Starting with the logos of the different companies—the Warner-Pathé rooster, the globe circled by the word \\"Universal,\\" the Paramount cameraman standing in profile and turning his camera to the audience—it goes on to show the newsreel's history and format.Some of the footage is worth remembering. There is the sinking of the United States gunboat Panay by the Japanese in the 1930's. A cameraman was aboard and got the whole thing. There is the execution of a Cuban by firing-squad, again in the 30's; and a lovely scene of Bess Truman trying unsuccessfully to break a champagne bottle on a new airplane.The film does not try to show the best footage, however. It tries for a mix of the devastating and the trivial—as any ordinary week's newsreel might have shown. The result is authentic, but sometimes tedious.Intercut with this are interviews with the old, organ-toned commentators, and with some of the principal cameramen. Unused footage from the crash of an airplane into the Empire State Building shows the charred bodies inside the office where the plane struck. After it we are shown a touching interview with Max Markman, who was the photographer. He breaks down recalling the scene and mutters \\"Cut, cut,\\" as the camera captures his tears.There are several short items on the same program. One is a take-off on the newsreel style. Called \\"The Ritz Newsiola,\\" it is funny for a few minutes, but turns fairly pointless. There is a tiny film about a rudimentary portable movie projector in a Pakistani market; and one about a mobile movie-showing team in Cuba.

He's on my mind because of the smell of cigarettes. He was a lifetime three-pack-a-day smoker, and his smoker's musk lingered over everything he touched. I was living in a furnished apartment in Atlanta last fall, as Emory University's visiting writer, and the person who preceded me in that apartment had left his traces in the air, on the walls and in cigarette burns on the rim of the plastic bathtub. The edges of the dining table and kitchen counters were nicked with little brown parabolas where a pinched butt had smoldered to its filter. Careless, hard-smoking people will be gone in a decade - it's hard to see them now as Bogarts and Hellmans after the Surgeon General has put them on notice.

While the picture looks edited through a meat grinder, the source must have had something, judging by picaresque bits and pieces.Take, for instance, the amusing, touching Greenwich Village chapter that is plunked into the picture, then yanked out inconclusively involving Campbell, who is fine here, with Tisha Sterling as a wistful, up-tight student. This beautiful girl is simply wonderful in her small role.Instead, the prolonged home stretch centers on Campbell's attraction to the chattering Miss Darby (Miss True Grit), who looks like a chipmunk with a permanent wave.

With a little fine tuning in the kitchen and better managerial judgment in the dining rooms, the 1852 Inn could be a standout spot.\\n\\n On one of our visits, however, all diners were seated on the enclosed dining porch, trendy with hanging plants, bare polished floors, stained glass and attractive but uncomfortable white bentwood chairs. This room quickly filled with noise and smoke, while the other dining area, the Peach Room, a tall, cool Victorian affair with fireplace, remained empty. We report this because the restaurant is very much worth visiting, and the forewarned who prefer calmer surroundings can ask to be seated elsewhere, including the Peach Room.

Six generations of American symphonists belie that notion. Now Minimalism has proven that the trade routes work in both directions. The Bang on a Can Festival noted that point in its opening concert on Thursday evening, when it presented a program of European Minimalists at Town Hall. American Minimalism had its turn Friday evening at La Mama.   In \\"De Tijd\\" (\\"Time\\"), the Dutch composer Louis Andriessen used the style in an attempt to create the effect of time standing still. The notion was doomed to failure: music with lots of harmonic movement inevitably marks the passage of time, and time weighs heavily on music that is entirely static. Mr. Andriessen's approach in the 1981 work was to have a percussion group punctuate sustained, hazily harmonized orchestral chords while a female choir intoned a passage from St. Augustine.

Smith, who, before taking his seat, shook hands with many friends. Mr. Smith was also able to look at himself in shadow form and hear his own voice coming from the screen in introducing Mr. Dowling's picture.\\"The Rainbow Man\\" is an ingenuous stream of slow music and tears, with occasional interludes of more or less effective comedy. Those in the theatre laughed heartily at the fun, and for all one knows they may have shed tears over the distressing state of affairs that surround Rainbow Ryan (Mr. Dowling). Sometimes the incidents are reminiscent of ancient melodramas, for one perceives the most amazing coincidences throughout the picture.The conspicuous attraction in this venture is Marian Nixon, whose beauty is remarkable and whose voice is soft and charming. While she is on the screen there is not the slightest hint of tedium, for one forgets about the story in watching her sincere acting, which possesses a wonderfully natural quality. If she is about to weep, she looks sad and her chin throbs in her grief. When she smiles, her eyes beam with genuine pleasure. She is dressed in a dainty, sober fashion, which suits her wholesome appearance. Her eyes are dark and her hair is brown. She moves with an easy grace, and when she speaks, even the lines allotted to her in this far-from-favored narrative are spoken so engagingly that they add considerably to every incident in which she figures. Mr. Dowling may be able to sing, but the talking voice of Marian Nixon is even more appealing. Being pretty, she gives a reason for Rainbow Ryan's sudden outburst of affection. He falls in love with Mary Lane (Miss Nixon) in one day.In the ordinary course of events in a big city, it might have been virtually impossible for Mary ever to find Rainbow Ryan and his little pal, Billy. But in this story it seems to be a mere matter of hours before she discovers where this Rainbow Ryan is living in Manhattan.Sometimes Mr. Dowling sings when one doesn't expect it. One rather wishes that he would save his melody for some other scene where it might be more natural. There are, however, so many odd happenings in this yarn that it has to be looked at with a lenient eye. It has little if any drama, but now and again a bit of comedy with a dog or with a monkey is bound to create merriment.At the outset there is Billy's father, who is fatally hurt through a fall from a trapeze. The dying man requests that Rainbow look after Billy. Soon Rainbow and Billy appear in a minstrel troupe, and they arrive at a small town hotel, where Mary's father, a somewhat grouchy individual, dislikes stage people. He is also against having dogs in the place, and the dog of this story takes the sign from its nail and puts it where it will not mean anything to anybody.Mary subsequently goes to the theatre, where the minstrel show is holding forth, and it is Rainbow Ryan's singing to the girl that causes the irate father to leave the place with his daughter. Doc Hardy, the minstrel manager, is wrathful indeed, and he discharges Rainbow, who takes with him his pal, Billy.Then these two are seen in New York, with crackers and milk for poor Rainbow to eat after a hard day looking for work. They share and share alike, Rainbow and Billy. It all looks pretty black for the singing man and his diminutive friend, when lo! Mary appears upon the scene with the information that Billy is her sister's child! Insurance is coming to him, and all looks rosy, except that Rainbow is out of work.Just when things might have gone smoothly, the irascible Colonel Lane has to pop up in New York, and the self-sacrificing Rainbow is impelled to deny to Mary all his affectionate words so that she and Billy will go back to the Colonel.While they do not find a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, they find each other, and Rainbow Ryan is so overwhelmed at the presence of Mary in the theatre, where he is again officiating as a minstrel man, that he sings to her and takes her in his arms. Later Doc Hardy informs the audience that what they saw and heard was real and not part of the show.Sam Hardy is excellent as the minstrel manager. Mr. Dowling's songs send one away humming something about \\"Sleepy Valley.\\" Master Darro is precocious, but mildly amusing in parts of the picture.

Filmed for the most part in Africa at a Church of Sweden mission there and played by a large cast of natives in support of the professional troupe, this picture is chiefly distinguished by the authenticity of its atmosphere and the remarkably forthright and genuine performances of its native cast.Actually, the artless little story of a young missionary's ordeal under the strain of the natives' resistance and the deaths of his child and his wife is an obvious, unsurprising fiction, lacking the full dramatic power which more capable writing and direction might have given it. The tensions are only mildly realized and the great crisis in the missionary's life, when he returns to his work after a period of denial, is allowed to occur quite casually.But a sense of earnest endeavor is subtly transmitted by this film, due largely, as we say, to the simplicity and honesty with which it was made. Rune Lindstrom, who was also one of the writers, has a modest dignity in the leading role and Nils Dahlgren is particularly compelling, through his warmth and candor, as an older missionary. Carin Forsberg is also natural and ingenuous as the young man's wife and Victor Seastrom, the famous Swedish director, is impressive, though briefly seen, as the latter's father.This film, which was made with the cooperation of the Church of Sweden, is being sponsored in this country by the Religious Film Association, an inter-denominational agency of major Protestant fellowships, and it will probably find its audience mainly in non-theatrical outlets, in churches, clubs and schools.

David Newell, who is entrusted with the part of an unscrupulous individual, is only successful in an old style of melodramatic acting. As the ignoble Randolph Bannister, Mr. Newell does his best to make himself disliked, not only by the audience, but also by Joan Marshall (Miss Boardman) and virtually everybody with whom he comes into contact. Toward the end one is astonished that he has the temerity to try to embrace Joan, for she looks physically equal to taking care of herself.Bannister is a persistent cad, who elopes with Joan at an early stage of the narrative. But, when she discovers that he has no intention, of making her his wife, she leaves him and eventually goes to work as a stenographer in a big city. Her employer's son, David Bruce, who had rescued her during one of the Mississippi floods, falls in love with her and they are married.Like villains in many films, Bannister decides to make himself nonsensically unpleasant. He sends a bouquet to Joan, who on observing Bannister's card attached to it, promptly throws the flowers out of the window. This is done just as Bannister is about to enter the house and he picks up the bouquet and gives it to Joan while her husband is present. This idea seems to please him immensely.These incidents take place in Joan's home town, to which David has been sent to supervise the work on strengthening the levee. When the place is threatened with another flood, Bannister is only concerned with trying to separate Joan from David. There is a scene wherein Joan endeavors to tell David of the page from her past, but her husband refuses to listen. The muddled story goes on with its strange happenings until the river breaks through the levee, and as might be anticipated, one of the first victims of the rushing waters is Bannister. Through one of those melodramatic coincidences, David chances to notice his wife in the water, and he succeeds in saving her.No water has been spared in filming the flood and a heavy motion-picture rain falls in the course of nearly all the scenes of the small town.Miss Boardman is beautiful, and where the lines give her the least opportunity she makes the most of them, except possibly in one sequence, where she is too calm, in view of what is happening.

Whatever one thinks of Ms. Messager's work -- and my final assessment is mixed -- her art was inexplicably  absent from the New York scene in the early and mid-1970's, when other European  Conceptualists and Post-Minimalists like Hanne Darboven, Jean Le Gac and Christian Boltanski had a regular presence. Ms. Messager has had only three solo shows here since the early 80's, efforts that raised her profile without exposing her early efforts.         This is accomplished by the show at the Modern, which has been organized in tandem with the Los Angles County Museum of Art, where it had its premiere in slightly larger form last summer. It creates a firm niche for Ms. Messager's highly personal feminist art, with its quirkily inventive processes and its obsessive accumulations of drawings, words, drawn-over photographs, embroidery and stuffed animals and its sometimes abrupt shifts in means and ends.

In these tranquil moments, welcome refreshments can be served, much like those found at teatime in the finest English hotels. Indeed, a growing number of hotels and restaurants in this country are offering late afternoon fare reminiscent of proper English teas.\\n\\nTeatime can be a graceful alternative to the cocktail hour and a warm prelude to a concert or an evening at the theater. Tea and a light variety of foods allow evening entertainment to be more fully appreciated. Since teatime can start earlier than most pre-theater gatherings, it affords yet another advantage: extra minutes for easy conversation - an art form in peril of being lost to contemporary schedules.\\n\\nTraditional English high tea often is thought to be the aristocratic relative of afternoon tea. In actuality, high tea at first was synonymous with the 5 o'clock supper of laborers and farmers who retired with the sun.

In a 1944 film, directed  by Jules Dassin, the ghost was played by Charles Laughton, surrounded by a cast  that included Margaret O'Brien, Robert Young and Peter Lawford.

It did not seem out of place in a tribute to a distinguished contemporary choreographer. Yet it still resembled a 19th-century ballet. This is because when George Balanchine staged \\"Coppelia\\" for his company in 1974, he based his production upon that of Petipa and added new choreography of his own in the 19th-century style.

Mr. Gray has described himself as a \\"poetic journalist,\\" and his particular skills as an observer have always hinged on a dialectic seesaw between satiric clarity and paranoiac murkiness.

He can fight in a barroom or on top of a coal mine and be the only man who can emerge from its inky blackness without so much as a dirty speck on his countenance. He is so good that he is hated by nearly everybody, including his father-in-law.The villain is Joe Lawler (Wallace Beery), who, apparently unaware of the futility of trying to defeat a hero—impersonated by Thomas Meighan—calls all his unscrupu—ousness and ingenuity into play to accomplish this impossible task. Shackleton is another black sheep. He derives his living from selling intoxicating drinks to the miners. Our hero visits Shackleton's bar one day, and with the aid of a few men with rifles, cleans out the place and then smashes up all the bottles. Shackleton appears to have an extraordinary sense of humor, as he later goes up to Blackford, and with a dry smile, tells the latter that he has saved one bottle.Mr. Meighan appears to have been unfortunate in the selection of his recent vehicles and also in their direction. It looks very much as if he were doing most of the directing himself, which is a mistake, as it is obvious that Mr. Meighan's productions need new ideas. It is seldom that one sees a picture so utterly lacking in drama as \\"Coming Through.\\" One is really not interested in any of the happenings. There was one sequence in which Shackleton goes behind his bar with a mallet. Naturally one surmises that he would get the chance to use it on Blackford's head. But somebody willed otherwise, as the super-hero, after whisky is tossed in his face, is much too quick for any ordinary mortal.Lila Lee as Alice Rand adds to the tameness of this screen effort. The outstanding performance is delivered by Wallace Beery, who is by no means as good as he is usually. The story counts with him as it does with Mr. Meighan and the public. This narrative is as flat as the proverbial pancake, with only a few scenes of a coal mine to relieve its monotonous trend.

A month ago, he could be heard in a semiprivate showcase for the veteran drummer Michael Carvin at Bergdorf Goodman","excerpt":"a month before that, he played the Village Vanguard with another veteran drummer, the legendary Roy Haynes. And in February at Zankel Hall, he stood out in a band led by the trumpeter Dave Douglas. On all three occasions Mr. Strickland, above, demonstrated a strong but malleable tone, a relaxed yet resolute sense of time and a knack for well-contoured improvisations. The only asset not readily apparent was the appealingly simple compositional savvy that suffuses ''Twi-Life'' (StrickMuzik), Mr. Strickland's self-released new album. It's a quartet album, or a quartets album, to be precise: Mr. Strickland offers one disc with Robert Glasper on piano, Vicente Archer on acoustic bass and his twin brother, E. J. Strickland, on drums, and another with Lage Lund on guitar, Brad Jones on electric bass and his brother once again. The two ensembles, which play successive sets tonight at the Jazz Gallery, have noticeably different sounds. The acoustic quartet can be either fierce or fluttering, like the old Branford Marsalis Quartet, a clear influence. (On an original called ''Sesame Street,'' Mr. Strickland effectively reveals that he had a bigger childhood hero than Big Bird.) The electric band, dubbed Twi-Life, is generally airier, with a mellow groove. But both groups give some sense of Mr. Strickland's seemingly natural composure at the helm, a gift that's sure to come in handy as he fully outgrows his apprentice phase.

The Lead Contamination Control Act banned lead in water fixtures and systems, except as an ingredient, but not more than 8 percent. The effect of the law and this loophole is to ban lead solder and lead linings in plumbing systems and coolers, while brass, which contains as much as 8 percent lead, is permitted.    The 8 percent rule was adopted because of lobbying by the plumbing supply industry, and brass is still one of the most common materials in water supply terminations. Most of your readers have brass faucets (albeit covered in chrome or porcelain) and brass fittings in their ice makers, instant hots, coffee machines, water fountains and coolers.   Studies by the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Sanitation Foundation and the Plumbing Manufacturers Institute have determined that lead leaching from brass faucets can cause water greatly to exceed E.P.A. drinking water standards. A typical new brass faucet has an internal volume of 125 milliliters. Water remaining inside the faucet for several hours will leach lead from the brass, and the water retained in the faucet can contain dangerously high levels of lead. The internal water can contaminate the first several liters drawn from the faucet.   Although this is most serious in new brass faucet fixtures and fountains, studies by E.P.A. and the plumbing institute show that significant lead levels persist even after many uses. The result is that first-draw water in many of our homes and in many school fountains is contaminated by dangerous levels of lead.    Imagine a child waking up in the middle of the night and sipping water from the bathroom faucet or from a cup placed under a faucet that is turned on momentarily","excerpt":"a mother drawing a quart of water early in the morning (retained overnight in the fixture) to make several bottles of formula for her baby for the day; a father filling the frozen orange juice can to the brim three times by turning the water on and off, making a pitcher of orange juice; children taking a drink of water after school from the faucet by putting the glass under the faucet and turning it on; the school chef drawing several liters of first-draw water to cook vegetables for lunch; drawing a cupful of hot water from an instant hot water maker for hot chocolate or tea.   In the absence of a legislative ban on 8 percent brass, E.P.A. and the Plumbing Manufacturers Institute haggle over draft voluntary standards for plumbing materials. E.P.A. has insisted that standards be tough, while the institute has promoted further loopholes, such as restricting lead measurement to aged brass faucets. Certainly, a program to test for lead in school drinking water is imperative, but it is not enough.    Our children are exposed to lead in water at school and at home, and the results can be devastating. Parents must teach children never to drink first-draw water at home. The water should be turned on and allowed to run a minute or so or until it becomes cold, to avoid lead leached from faucets. Unfortunately, this procedure may be useless at a school water fountain, where the internal volume is several liters.   Parents should also immediately determine if their household or building plumbing system and service line (water line from the main to the house) are made of lead. If so, they are in great jeopardy, and avoiding first-draw water will not solve the problem. This is a complicated and serious matter, upon which legislators have not been moving with any discernible speed. The public must protect itself.  ARTHUR H.

In this story of canteen workers in the World War, there is an attempt, but scarcely a successful one, to reveal the experiences of women in uniform in the great conflict—their tenacity and courage in emergencies, their bickering and jealousies, their friendships and hatreds.Although there is undeniably an element of interest during some of the action of this picture, it cannot be said to be gifted with much in the way of spontaneity. It is a forced story of an unusual group of girls which lacks the quality of naturalness.Janice Lee is jealous of the intimacy she presumes has occurred between Tony, a young aviator, and Monica Dale, who has won the sobriquet of the Duchess. Monica is acted by Evelyn Brent, who does quite well by her rôle. Monica is soured by war. She is reckless and it is not disappointing to one or two of the canteen workers when she is reprimanded by Mrs. Schuyler, the head of the uniformed girls. In the end, however, Monica proves to all concerned that, while she is embittered by the life at the front, she can be a heroine.Lil Wheeler, played by Lilyan Tashman, solaces herself by drinking brandy, which is stored in a cellar of a temporary billet. Lil is given also to wisecracking, particularly after imbibing some of the alcoholic stimulant which she keeps in a rubber hot water bottle . Then there is Prudence Graham, who by no means lives up to her first name, for when there is a chance to cause a spat, she does so, her animus being centred on Monica.Bombs from enemy air craft cause the girls to seek refuge elsewhere and they are seen in various dugouts and shellholes. The main topic of discussion is invariably the doings of Monica and her supposed affair with Tony, reference to which delights Prudence and makes Janice furious. In fact these canteen workers have their own little war.Fanny Smithers, acted by Louise Fazenda, at one point is frightened by a rat. Monica throws a German hand grenade into the opening where the rat is and the explosion kills Prudence. This leads to further bitterness between Janice and Monica, but when the time comes both reveal their grit.Irene Rich gives a diginified interpretation of Mrs. Schuyler. Miss Tashman contributes some moderately amusing moments.

The trombone, an instrument typically associated with slides and energy and swing, with sudden moves and blasts, is here turned into an almost introspective isolate: lyrically mourning, then raging and mourning again. At the beginning, it sings a low, two-note sigh that is almost a groan. Slowly, as if through accumulated grief, that motif grows, supported by shimmers in the orchestra and given energy by roiling percussive thunder.   The work is distinctive, unsettling, yet structurally clear. It was a Philharmonic commission for the orchestra's 150th anniversary and was given a stunningly virtuosic performance by Joseph Alessi, the principal trombonist.

The guidelines were eased by Mr. Baxter in 1982, using something called the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index, or the H.H.I.

And this same ambivalence may also have set Jorn restlessly exploring painting's periphery. There, as the non-Expressionist works at Emmerich suggest, he edged into appropriation in ways that make him seem almost prototypically post-modern, a precursor to Sigmar Polke and other stylistically polymorphous painters of today.   Jorn was active, perhaps overactive, in the postwar European art world. He wrote almost compulsively on art and theory (usually from a Marxist stance), lived in Paris and northern Italy as well as in Denmark, and was part of several of the shifting, short-lived art movements that characterized his time.

The air terminal used to be at the central railroad station (Stazione Termini), but for the World Cup soccer championship finals last June and July it was transferred to a new, vast building, a postmodern annex to the Stazione Ostiense. One reason that many Italian travelers have avoided the new facility is that taxis outside the building are rare.   The trip to connect with subways or buses can be cumbersome for arriving air passengers. A series of escalators and people movers on an overpass spanning 14 railroad tracks takes passengers to the square from which municipal buses depart. A long underpass from Ostiense station's Platform No. 1, with moving sidewalks, leads to the Piramide station (one mile south of the Colosseum) of Line B of Rome's rudimentary subway network. From there it is a seven-minute ride (63-cent fare) to the central railroad terminal, where passengers may transfer to Line A, which traverses the center of the city. Travelers with luggage may have a hard time squeezing into crowded subway cars.    Daytime bus service between Leonardo da Vinci Intercontinental Airport at Fiumicino (FCO on airline tags) and the central Stazione Termini ended Nov. 20, although the buses still run hourly between 1 and 6 A.M. Fare: about $4.45 (on the basis of 1,120 lire to the dollar). From 6:30 A.M to 12:15 A.M. trains shuttling between Fiumicino Airport and the new City Air Terminal are the only public transportion for arriving or departing plane passengers.   The trains run at 20-minute intervals over a newly built rail spur. The $4.45 tickets have to be bought from machines at the airport rail station or at the City Air Terminal. The 16-mile trip takes 25 minutes.   A cab ride to the center of Rome from Fiumicino Airport costs at least $45, from the new City Air Terminal (if you find a taxi there), $8 to $10 more in rush-hour traffic.  Cruise Ship For Albania    The Yugoslav-owned Adriana will be the first cruise ship to take Americans to Albania since the United States and Albania severed diplomatic relations after World War II, according to the ship's New York agent.    The Adriana will call at Durazzo, the port for the Albanian capital, Tirana, during a series of eight cruises next summer. Albania lifted its ban on American travel last May, allowing Americans to enter from cruise ships and on organized tours. The 300-passenger, air-conditioned vessel has scheduled 10- and 11-day cruises, starting from Venice. Piraeus, Greece, Istanbul, and the Greek island of Mykonos are among ports of call after stops at Dubrovnik, Yugoslavia, and Durazzo. The trips are scheduled from May to September. Fares range from $1,060 to $1,900 a person, double occupancy. Information: International Cruise Center, 250 Old Country Road, Mineola, N.Y. 11501 (516-747-8880 or 800-221-3254).  London's Kew Triples Fee     The entrance fee for the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew in London was increased this month from $2 to about $6 ($:1 to $:3). Visitors are handed a letter from Kew's director that says: \\"Keeping our gardens and buildings up to the standard expected of the world's best-known botanic garden and funding our vital research on plants, their uses and their conservation is costly.\\" The letter adds that the Government's annual grant of about $23 million is no longer adequate and that an additional $40 million a year is needed to finance Kew's worldwide research and conservation projects. Scientists add 45,000 plants a year to the Kew's collection of 6 million specimens.   Kew's trustees hope that added attractions will maintain the number of visitors, now about 1.25 million a year. Among the additions are the Princess of Wales Conservatory, which has 10 computer-controlled climate zones under one roof","excerpt":"a multimedia exhibition on various uses of plants, and a new gallery of botanical paintings.    Under the the new admission rates, the elderly pay $3, children pay $2 and an annual pass is $24. The increases also apply to Wakehurst Place, Kew's annex garden in Sussex. Kew is open daily from 9:30 A.M. to about an hour before dusk. Phone Check-In    In a move to provide aggravation-free hotel check-in for its frequent business travelers, Hyatt Hotels Corporation has started an 800-CHECK-IN line at about 100 hotels in the United States and Canada. The new service allows some two million members of the hotel group's frequent traveler program to confirm reservations and get room numbers ahead of time. Guests must call between 1 and 10 P.M. local hotel time on the day of arrival with a credit card number. Haiti Alert    The State Department continues to advise Americans to defer nonessential travel to Haiti in view of the possibility of disturbances arising from the Dec. 16 election there. Although there have been no threats to American citizens, caution should be exercised and crowds avoided, the department adds in an advisory issued this month. Citizens who do travel to Haiti should register on arrival with the consular section of the United States Embassy on the Rue Oswald Durant (509-22-0200) in Port-au-Prince. JERUSALEM ROAD REDISCOVERED     After more than a decade of searching, archeologists in Jerusalem have identified the East-West axis built by the Romans about A.D. 135, under Hadrian's rule. The road, the Decomanus, was uncovered during the installation of a new sewer system near Temple Mount, according to Yitzhak Yaacovy, director general of the East Jerusalem Development Corporation.   The road and its north-south counterpart, the Cardo Maximus, were in use from Jerusalem's Roman period (roughly the first to fourth centuries A.D.) through the early Arab period, which ended in the 10th century. These routes still define Jerusalem's layout, the Cardo running along Suq Khan el-Zeit from the Damascus Gate south to the Jewish Quarter and the Decomanus along King David Street and the Street of the Chain from the Jaffa Gate to the Western Wall. The Cardo was discovered about 15 years ago, and archeologists have searched since then for the other axis.    A half-mile section of the Cardo in the Jewish quarter is now lined with art galleries, boutiques and cafes. Shoppers walk about 10 feet below street level on ancient paving stones, 3 feet by 6 and grooved by the Romans for better footing. The shops there are open daily to 7 P.M. and closed Friday evening and Saturday.    The newly discovered portion of the Decomanus will be visible to visitors for a few weeks; it will then be covered over for the sewer project.

It is far ahead of any other European audible production so far presented here. The tonal quality of the voices is wonderfully lifelike and the players speak their lines with the necessary spontaneity.It is a picture that may be appreciated to some extent even by those who are unfamiliar with German, for it has been directed with skill and imagination. The events leading up to the capture of a mysterious slayer are pictured with a full measure of suspense. In fact, it is one of the outstanding murder mysteries, for, in telling the story, the director does not try to point the finger of suspicion at every person before exposing the real criminal.The principal feminine character, that of A Lady in Evening Dress, is impersonated by Charlotte Susa, a beautiful actress who resembles Vilma Banky. Her portrayal is excellent and her voice is as pleasing as her presence.Several clever ideas are set forth in this film, which is sufficiently subtle to merit little being told of the story. It can, however, be written that as the chronicle proceeds a wrestler is humbled by a stalwart young man who knows a thing or two about jui-jitsu. This same individual teaches a pickpocket a lesson and he also reveals himself to be a man of considerable cunning. Perhaps he does have the director on his side during a few of the interludes, but not enough to spoil the drama of the film.The Tiger, as the murderer is alluded to in this yarn, makes it a point of shooting each victim through the forehead and taking the unfortunate person's valuables. At the opening of the story the police are discussing the Tiger's most recent crime. The scene then switches to one inside a cabaret, which harbors some suspicious-looking persons. A man in dress clothes enters the place and because he offers a 100-mark note in payment for his drinks he is suspected by at least one patron of being the Tiger. The police commissioner is notified and a detective appears in the cabaret. He examines the 100-mark note given by the well-dressed stranger and observes that it is not one of those listed as having been taken from the Tiger's victims.Following an apache dance exhibition and a song rendered by a girl, a pistol shot is heard from one of the compartments. A middle-aged woman, who had attracted attention through her display of gems, is found dead, a bullet having pierced her forehead! A banker, who was sitting with this latest victim of the Tiger, is apprehended and searched by the police. He is in possession of an automatic pistol, one cartridge of which has been fired. Just when one imagines that this highly excited person is going to be held for the murder, a telephone message comes to the Police Commissioner, and the banker is released.It is not until the closing episode that the identity of the Tiger is revealed. It is an adroitly conceived surprise, which causes one to admire the clever work of a police official.Besides the alluring Fraülein Susa, others who contribute to the success of this subject are Harry Frank, Hertha von Walther, Trude Berliner, Max Wilmsen, Max Maximilian, Erich Kestin and Henry Pless.This feature is shrewdly photographed. During one sequence the screen is dark, but the voices of two of the characters are heard and also the periodical reports of a pistol, the flashes of which serve to give an outline of the person firing the weapon. THE SCREEN","excerpt":"A Murder Mystery in German."},{"year":"1927","title":"Shrewdly produced with an astonishingly clever appreciation, for its suitability to the screen, a Ufa production concerned with psychoanalysis is to be seen at the Fifth Avenue Playhouse. It is called \\"Secrets of the Soul,\\" a title that hardly fits the idea, as it might better be applied to any of the wandering-girl type of movie. This German film is a most intelligent piece of work in which the leading rôle, Martin Fellman, is acted by Werner Krauss, who figured in Max Reinhardt's spectacle, \\"The Miracle,\\" and who has also contributed a number of fine performances to the screen.This film has individuality. Its scenes are all interesting, and those dealing with Fellman's dream reveal far more imagination than one is accustomed to observe in motion pictures. This offering was directed by G. W. Pabst, and the leading feminine rôle, Mrs. Fellman, is portrayed by Ruth Weyher.Here one first discovers Fellman comfortable and happy, but a combination of circumstances creates in him a knife-phobia, so strong that he is impelled to leave his home for fear that the mental aberration might cause him to slay his wife. The episodes that lead up to this condition are skillfully depicted, with exactly the proper emphasis on each. It is quite by accident that Fellman discovers a medical man who is interested in psychoanalysis. He seeks the advice of this authority, and not only does the expert put two and two together in so far as Fellman's recent experiences, but he also satisfies himself and the patient that childhood incidents in his case are not to be ignored. What has been preying on Fellman's mind as much as anything is the fact that he has no children. There enters into his dream queer thoughts, mingled with childhood playthings and weird suggestions of jealousy of his wife's cousin, from whom Mrs. Fellman had received a message.So great does Fellman's fear to handle a knife become that he goes to his mother, and she, without permitting him to catch sight of a knife, cuts up his food so that her son can eat it with a spoon.The happenings that lead to Fellman's unbalanced mental state are: Shaving a strand of hair from his wife's neck and causing a slight cut","excerpt":"a murder next door and the visit from a detective; the arrival of the cousin, and then a nightmare.Mr. Krauss is faultless as Fellman. He gives you an idea of despair from the slightest movement of his shoulders and hands when he is standing with his back to the screen. He depicts kindliness overtaken by worry. His performance is so remarkable that one considers him as the victim of the peculiar state of mind. Miss Weyher and the others in this production, especially the individual who plays the physician, are unusually capable.Harry Langdon is also to be seen at this little theatre in a Mack Sennett comedy known as \\"His Marriage Wow.\\" It is highly amusing and shows that this young comedian is a genius at stirring up laughter by a movement of his eyes or a twist of his mouth.
